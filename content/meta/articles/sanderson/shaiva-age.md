The Saiva Age  
— The Rise and Dominance of Saivism During the Early Medieval Period —  
Alexis SANDERSON 

The early medieval period, from about the fifth century to the thirteenth, saw a decline in the role of Srauta sacrifice in the religious ceremonies under- ´ taken by Indian rulers. But it was not that kings turned aside from the brahman ical tradition in a fundamental sense. They continued to uphold the brahmanical social order of the castes and disciplines (varṇāśramadharmaḥ) and they were commonly commended in inscriptions from the fifth to the eighth centuries for having rigorously imposed it on their subjectṣWe see this in the case of the Maukhari Harivarman in the fifth century, the Maharājādhir āja Gopacandra of ¯ Vanga and the Parivr ˙ ajaka Mah ārāja Sam ¯ . kṣobha of D. abhalar ājya in the sixth, ¯ the Puṣyabhuti Prabh ākaravardhana of Kanyakubja, Bh āskaravarman of Pr āg- ¯ jyotiṣa, the Maitraka Kharagraha II Dharmaditya of Valabh ¯ī, the Gurjara Dadda ¯ III of Bharukaccha in the seventh, and the Licchavi Sivadeva of Nepal at the ´ turn of the seventh and eightḥ1 The same claim is seen in the account of the

history of Kashmir before the advent of the Karkot ¯ .a dynasty in the seventh cen tury given in the twelfth by the Kashmirian historian Kalhaṇ a. His chronology for this early phase of his country’s history is confused, but it is likely that we should assign to the fifth or sixth century the king Gopaditya whom he com- ¯ mends for having restored the first and perfect Age through his regard for the castes and brahmanical disciplineṣ2 He also reports a popular belief of his time that in order to promote the orthodox brahmanical social order the Hephthalite Mihirakula, who ruled Kashmir in the early sixth century, had settled natives of Aryade ¯ sa in his kingdom, which was then, we are told, devoid of the true religion ´ (dharmaḥ), being overrun by Dards and Tibetanṣ3 

Seeing these claims of the royal imposition of the varṇāśramadharmaḥ one thinks of the non-geographical definition of territory fit for brahmanical rites (yaj ñiyo deśaḥ) formulated by Manu’s commentator Medhatithi during the ninth ¯ or tenth century, namely that it is any land in which a conquering brahmanical king settles the four caste-classes and imposes on the rest of the population the status of untouchables (caṇ ḍālaḥ). This definition served, I propose, to accommo date the fact of the territorial expansion of brahmanical society into new regions that was one of salient features of the early medieval perioḍ4 

2 Rājataraṅgiṇī 1.339: jugopa gopādityo ’tha kṣmāṁsadvīpāṁtadātmajaḥ| varṇā- śramapratyavekṣādarśitādiyugodayaḥ‘Next his son Gopaditya protected the earth ānd its continents, causing men to experience the arising of a [new] First Age through his attention to [the maintenance of] the caste-classes and disciplines’. 

3 Rājataraṅgiṇī 1.312–313b:ākrānte dāradair bhaut.t.air mlecchair aśucikarmabhiḥ | vinaṣt.adharme deśe ’smin *puṇ yācārapravartane (conj. : pravartanam Eḍ) |ārya deśyān sa saṁsthāpya vyatanod dāruṇ aṁtapaḥ‘*In order to (conj.) promote pious observance in this land that had been overrun by barbarians of impure conduct, Dards and Tibetans, and [so] had lost the [brahmanical] Dharma, he settled [brah mins] of Aryade ¯ sa. Thereafter he performed a terrible penance’. S ´ TEIN (1979, p. 46), no doubt faithfully reproducing the reading of the codex archetypus, gives puṇ yā cārapravartanam rather than puṇ yācārapravartane and this leaves him no alter native other than to take not only dāruṇ aṁtapaḥ but also this as the object of the verb: “he performed a terrible penance, and re-established pious observances”. But the reading is unacceptable. For even if one can believe, as I cannot, that puṇ yācāra pravartanaṁ vyatanot is not too inelegant an expression for an author of Kalhaṇ a’s calibre, there remains the fact that it requires us to believe also that vyatanot gov erns two objects even though the conjunction necessary for this interpretation is lacking. I have therefore emended to puṇ yācārapravartane, which, taken as an instance of the use of the locative of purpose (nimittasaptamī), yields an entirely appropriate meaning and supposes a scribal error that is readily explained by the ease with which readers of the Kashmirian script can mistake -e for -aṁ, the com mon substitute for -aṁ Furthermore, STEIN’s rendering ofāryadeśyān saṁsthāpya as “after killing the inhabitants of Aryade ¯ sa” is, in my view, much less probable ´ than the alternative adopted here, which is to take the verb form saṁsthāpya in its contextually more appropriate meaning, namely ‘having settled’.

Thus the first centuries of this period are presented in our sources as marked not by the decline of brahmanism but rather by its imposition, rein forcement, and expansioṇ Moreover, there is abundant epigraphical evidence of kings throughout this time bringing Vaidika brahmins into their kingdoms by making them grants of tax-exempt land,5thereby extending the penetration of brahmanical culture while facilitating the administration of their territories and promoting agricultural development.6 

Nonetheless, while kings continued to accept their role as the guardians of the brahmanical order (varṇāśramaguruḥ), their personal religious commitment generally took the form of Buddhism, Jainism, or, more commonly, devotion to Siva, Vis ´.ṇ u, the Sun-God (Surya/ ¯ Aditya), or the Goddess (Bhagavat ¯ī), the deities of the new initiatory religions, allegiances that were commonly declared in their inscriptions by the inclusion amid their royal titles of epithets that mean ‘entirely 

ll. 24-26 on 2.23: yadi kathaṁcid brahmāvartādideśam api mlecchāākrameyuḥ tatraiva <ca> <svadharma?>vyavasthānaṁ kuryuḥ bhaved evāsau mlecchadeśaḥ. tathā yadi kaś cit kṣatriyādijātīyo rājā sādhvācaraṇ o mlecchān parājayec cātur varṇ yaṁ vāsayen mlecchāṁś cāryāvarta iva cāṇ ḍālān vyavasthāpayet so ’pi syād yaj ñiyaḥ‘If somehow foreigners were to invade such [pure] regions as that between the Sarasvatī and Dr̥ṣadvatī rivers (Brahmavarta) ¯ <and> impose <their religion?>, then even they would definitely become foreign lands [unfit for sacrifice]. By the same standard, if some king belonging to the Kṣatriya or other [suitable caste class] and of orthodox [brahmanical] observance were to conquer foreigners [in their lands], settle communities of the four caste-classes [there], and impose on those for eigners the status of untouchables, just as in the brahmanical heartland of India north of the Vindhyas (Ary āvarta), then those territories too would be fit for the ¯ performance of [Vaidika] sacrifices’. 

5 On the duty of the king to donate [tax-free] land and other valuables to learned Vaidika brahmins (viprāḥ, śrotriyāḥ) see, e.g., Yāj ñavalkyasmr̥ti 1. 315–320; 1. 323: nātaḥ parataro dharmo nr̥ pāṇāṁ yad raṇārjitam | viprebhyo dīyate dravyaṁ. . . ‘There is no higher religious obligation for kings than that of bestowing the wealth they acquire through war on learned Vaidika brahmins . . . ’; Viṣṇ usmr̥ti 3.81–82: brāhmaṇebhyaś ca bhuvaṁ pratipādayet . . . ‘He should bestow land on brah mins’. On the king’s duty not to tax learned Vaidikas see Manusmr̥ti 7.133ab: mriyamāṇ o ’pyādadīta na rājā śrotriyāt karam ‘Even though dying [through poverty] a king may not levy a tax from a learned Vaidika’. The giving of land to learned brahmins is already advocated at length as the king’s religious duty in the Mahābhārata (Anuśāsanaparvan, Adhyāya 61); and that passage includes an injunction that it should be read to the king immediately after his consecration (13.61.36: abhiṣicyaiva nr̥ patiṁśrāvayed imamāgamam).

THE DOMINANCE OF SAIVISM ´ 

Among these alternatives devotion to Siva was the most commonly adopteḍ ´ During this period the epithet paramamāheśvaraḥ‘entirely devoted to Siva’ is ´ the most frequently encountered in declarations of the religious adherence of rulers;7 and of the many temples surviving or reported in inscriptions that were established by rulers and other notables from the late sixth century onwards in the subcontinent, the Khmer realm, the Cham kingdoms of Indo-China, and the kingdoms of Java and Bali, those dedicated to the worship of this god are much the most numerouṣ8 

The preponderance of Saivism during this period is also revealed by evidence ´ that all the other religious traditions competing for patronage were colonized or 

7 The royal epithet paramamāheśvaraḥ first appears in the epigraphical record in the fourth century in Andhra, in an inscription of the S´ ala ¯ nk˙ ayana Mah ārāja De- ¯ vavarman of Veng˙īpura (EI 9:7, ll. 1–7), probably the earliest of the S´ ala ¯ nk˙ ayanas ¯ in our records since this inscription alone is in Prakrit: sirīvijayaveṅgīpurā bha gavato cittarathasāmipādānujjhātassa bappabhat.t.ārakapādabhattasya parama māhessarassa sālaṅkāyanassa asamedhayājino mahārājasirīvijayadevavammassa vayaṇena . . . ‘From victorious Veng˙īpura: by the command of the S´ ala ¯ nk˙ ayana, ¯ who has performed the Asvamedha sacrifice, the venerable Mah ´ arāja Vijayadeva- ¯ varman, favoured by [his kuladevatā, the Siva] Citrarathasv ´ amin, loyal to [his] ¯ venerable father, entirely devoted to Siva . . . ’. It is mostly found in inscriptions but ´ occasionally appears on coinage. Thus the coins of Kr̥ṣṇ araja, the Kalacuri king ¯ of Mahis ¯ .matī, who ruled c. 550–575, have on their reverse, (with corrected ortho graphy): paramamāheśvara mātāpitr̥ pādānudhyāta śrīkr̥ṣṇ arāja (MIRASHI, CII 4i p. clxxxi). This is the standard term, as is confirmed by its use in literary sourceṣBut we also find the synonym atyantamāheśvaraḥ(e.g. CII 5:3, l. 8: Vakāt¯ .aka Pr̥thivīsena I, late fourth century), and, though very rarely and not to my knowledge in any inscription, paramaśaivaḥ(PETECH 1984, pp. 57 and 61: the twelfth-century Nepalese kings Indradeva and Anandadeva in the colophons of manuscripts). That ¯ the Taddhita māheśvaraḥis to be understood as formed from the name Mahesvara ´ in the meaning ‘devoted to Mahesvara’ ( ´ maheśvarabhaktaḥ), i.e. ‘devoted to Siva’, ´ is proved beyond doubt by the occurrence in inscriptions of analytic renderings of parallel termṣThus where the affiliation is with Viṣṇ u (/Bhagavat) we see not only paramabhāgavataḥ but also paraṁ bhagavadbhaktaḥ and in the case of the Sun-god (Surya/ ¯ Aditya) we see both ¯ paramasauraḥ and paramādityabhaktaḥ. And there are some cases in which the name of the deity precludes any but the analytic forṁ Thus where the deity is the Goddess or Mahabhairava we see ¯ paraṁ bha gavatībhaktaḥ and atyantasvāmimahābhairavabhaktaḥ. For all these epithets see MIRASHI CII 3, pp. 253–254, ṇ 3. 

8 This can readily be observed by perusing the published volumes of EITA. On the pre-eminence of Saivism among the Khmers up to the fall of Angkor see S ´ ANDER SON 2005a, pp. 402–421.

profoundly influenced by it. In the first part of this study I shall present this evidence for each religion in turn, but with particular attention to Buddhisṁ In the second I shall attempt to explain the factors that enabled Saivism to attain ´ this dominant positioṇ 

THE INCORPORATION OF S´ AKTISM ¯ 

The worship of the Goddess was progressively subsumed within Saivism, ´ being promoted by its adherents as a higher form of that religioṇ9 The Saiva ´ mainstream was, as one might expect, focused on Siva. This is so in the ´ earliest forms of the religion, which later Saivas would call the Atim ´ arga, ¯ practised by such Saiva ascetics as the P ´ a¯nc˜ arthikas, L ākulas, and So- ¯ masiddhantins, and it continued to be so in the Siddh ānta, the core tradition of ¯ the Mantramarga that emerged out of the Atim ārga from about the fifth century ¯ onwards, first in the corpus of Niśvāsa scriptures10 and then in a number of others, notable among which are the Pārameśvara (Pauṣkarapārameśvara), the Svāyambhuvas ¯utrasaṁ graha, the Rauravas ¯utrasaṁ graha, the Mataṅga pārameśvara, the Sarvaj ñānottara, the Kālottara in a number of redactions, the Kiraṇ a, the Parākhya, the Mr̥ gendra, the Br̥hatkālottara, the Mayasaṁ graha, the Devyāmata, and the Mohac ¯uḍ ottara, the last three representing a sub-corpus of texts of more restricted application concerned with the rituals of the installa tion of images and the consecration of temples, an area in which officiants of the Siddhanta were the dominant operativeṣBut as this Saiddh āntika core grew ¯ it was progressively surrounded by a diverse array of related liturgical systems for the propitiation of various forms of the ferocious deity Bhairava, seen by his devotees as a higher, more esoteric manifestation of Siva, and of forms of ´ the Goddess seen as embodiments of Siva’s divine power ( ´śaktiḥ). The Saiva ´ scriptures devoted to the cult of Bhairava came to be known collectively as the Mantrapīt.ha or Mantra Corpus, headed by the Svacchandatantra, which teaches the cult of Svacchandabhairava and his consort Aghoresvar ´ī, and the earlier among those devoted to cults of Goddesses as the Vidyap¯īt.ha or Vidya Corpus, ¯11

On the probable date of its earliest part see GOODALL and ISAACSON 2007. 11 For the use of the term pīt.ham in this context in the meaning ‘corpus’ or ‘collec tion’ see Tantrāloka 37.18c–19c1, quoting or paraphrasing the lost Anandaśāstra ¯: śrīmadānandaśāstrādau proktaṁ bhagavatā kila k sam ¯uhaḥ pīt.ham etac ca dvidhā dakṣiṇ avāmataḥ| mantro vidyeti ‘The Lord has taught in such scriptures as the Ananda ¯ that pīt.ham [here means] the corpus [of the non-Saiddhantika ¯ Saiva scrip- ´ tures]. It is divided into two, to the right and left [respectively], namely the

headed by (1) the Jayadrathayāmala, also known as the Siraścheda ´, consisting of four parts called hexads (ṣat.kam) because each is approximately six thousand verses in length, which teaches the cult of Kalasam ¯ . karṣaṇī or Kal¯ī in the first and those of numerous goddesses worshipped as her esoteric embodiments in the remaining three parts, evidently added at a later date—closely related to parts of this huge corpus are the scriptures of the Kal¯īkula, Kālīkulakrama sadbhāva, Kālīkulapa ñcaśataka and others, that were the scriptural basis of the Kal¯īkula Kal¯ī cult known as the Krama, Mahanaya, or Mah ārtha—, (2) the ¯ Siddhayogeśvarīmata, which teaches the cult of the goddesses Para, Par āpar ā, ānd Apara, to which the ¯ Mālinīvijayottara is related, the scripture taken as the foundation of the Trika variant of S´ akta ¯ Saivism expounded in the ´ Tantrāloka of the great Kashmirian Saiva Abhinavagupta ( ´ fl. c. 975–1025), (3) the Picumata or Brahmayāmala, which teaches the cult of the goddess Caṇ ḍ a Kāpālin ¯ī and numerous related Kalpas, and (4) the texts of the vāmasrotaḥ, of which only the Vīṇāśikha has come down to us intact, which teach the cult of the four goddesses Jaya, Vijay ā, Jayant ¯ī/Ajita, and Apar ājit ā, the sisters of the god Tumburu, ¯ venerated as an aspect of Siva. ´ 12 

Mantra[pīt.ha] and the Vidyap¯īt.ha’. The terms ‘right’ and ‘left’ assigned to the two Pīt.has follow the common notion that these are the relative positions of the male/masculine and female/feminine, Mantras being masculine and the deities they embody male and Vidyas being feminine and their deities female. ¯ 

12 The distinction in terms of left and right between the two Pīt.has in the passage of the Ananda ¯ cited in the preceding footnote must not be confused with that between the right current (dakṣiṇ asrotaḥ) and the left current (vāmasrotaḥ) of the Saiva scriptures, which derives from the fact that these are thought to have ´ emerged from the right and left faces of the five-faced composite Sada¯siva, those ´ of Aghora (Bhairava) and the feminine Vamadeva respectively. For of the texts of ¯ the two Pīt.has only those of the cult of the four sisters are assigned to the lat ter̥ The Siddhayogeśvarīmata and the Picumata are both assigned to the former, while according to itself the first S. at.ka of the Jayadrathayāmala is a hybrid of both (ubhayātmakam); see SANDERSON 2002, pp. 1–2. Of the other three faces the front and rear, the faces of Tatpuruṣa and Sadyojata, are seen as the source of the ¯ Garud ¯ . atantras and Bhutatantras, texts concerned respectively with procedures for ¯ the curing of the effects of poisons and demonic possession, while the upper face, that of ¯Is´ana, is seen as the source of the scriptures of the Siddh ānta, revealing that ¯ this, unlike the distinction between the two Pīt.has, is a Siddhanta-centric system ¯ of classificatioṇ It is adapted by the non-Saiddhantika Abhinavagupta as the basis ¯ of his esoteric account of the nature of the Saiva canon in the ´ Mālinīvijayavārtika but only by adding a sixth, upper-upper current (¯urdhvordhvasrotaḥ) above the Siddhanta as the source of the non-dualistic Kaula ( ¯ S´ akta) revelation that he takes ¯ to be the ultimate ground of the entire canoṇ Mālinīvijayavārtika 1.160–163b: prakr̥taṁ br ¯umahe devīvisr̥ṣt.āś citrasamvidaḥ| yāvat tāvat tad ¯urdhvordhvaṁ sroto yad bhedavarjitam k 161 saurabhargaśikhādīni tataḥśāstrāṇi tenire | uktaṁ bhargaśikhāyāṁca devena parameṣt.hiṇā k 162 ¯urdhvasrotodbhavaṁj ñānam idaṁtat paramaṁ priye | paramadhvaninordhvotthasaṁ vidr ¯upābhidhāyinā k 

[[46]]

To these we may add the scriptures of two later S´ akta cults, those of the ¯ goddesses Kubjika and Tripurasundar ¯ī. The scriptures of the former, the Ku bjikāmata and related texts such as the S. at.sāhasra, do not claim to be part of the Vidyap¯īt.ha. But they are closely related to, and draw heavily on, the sub corpus of texts within the Vidyap¯īt.ha that is headed by the Siddhayogeśvarīmata and is asssociated with the S´ akta system that would be developed under the ¯ 

name of the Trika: the Siddhayogeśvarīmata itself, the [Trika]kularatnamālā, the Tantrasadbhāva, the Devyāyāmala, and the Triśirobhairava. Also allied in character is the Nityāṣoḍ aśikārṇ ava or Vāmakeśvarīmata, the fundamental scripture of the cult of the goddess Tripurasundarī. This, which became the most widely established of India’s S´ akta cults, has no direct antecedents in the ¯ 

Vidyap¯īt.ha literature, but is rather an independent development out of an ear lier S´ akta tradition of the propitiation of goddesses known as the Nity ās in which ¯ rites for success in love predominateḍ13 This early cult was eclipsed by its 

īśānavaktraniryātāt siddhāntād bhedamādiśat ‘I shall return now to the matter in hanḍ The nondualistic upper-upper stream is present when the various modes of consciousness are [still] in the state of [primal] emission within the Goddess [Para]. ¯ From this [state of fusion] are created the Saurabhargaśikhā and other such [nond ualistic (Kaula) scriptures]. And the Supreme Lord has spoken [to this effect] in the Bhargaśikhā [itself], saying, “This knowledge, O beloved, is the supreme product of the upper face”. By using the word supreme [here] in reference to the nature of the consciousness that has arisen from this upper [face] he shows that he means some thing different from [and superior to] the Siddhanta, which has come forth from the ¯ face of ¯Is´ana’. ¯ 

13 The distinctness of this tradition is expressed in the Kumārīkhaṇ ḍ a of the Manthānabhairava in an account of the hierarchy of the various soteriolo gieṣIt places those who follow the scripture(s) of the Nityas above those of ¯ the Atimargic traditions (Mausula, Vaimala, L ākula) and below those of the ¯ Bhairava corpus comprising the scriptures of the left and right currentṣAbove this it places six S´ akta Tantras ( ¯ parāṣat.kam): three of the Trika (S. aḍ ardha [=Mālinīvijayottara], Bhairava[kula], and Vīrāvalī, then the Kālīkula [texts] of the Krama, and finally itself, in two scriptural levelṣIt is significant that it does not put the Nitya cult on the level of its ¯ S´ akta Tantras or even on ¯ that of the Bhairavatantras below them; see f. 213r3–7 (Muktisaṁ grahas ¯utra, vv. 108–114c): *musulāyudhahastānāṁ(eṁ : mausulāyudhahastānāṁ Coḍ) māyātattvaṁ paraṁ padam | śuddhaj ñānamayā vidyā vaimalānāṁ paraṁ padam k 109 aṣt.apramāṇ avedaj ñā lākulārthaviśāradāḥ| vrate pāśupate caiva aiśvaraṁ paramaṁ padam k 110 navanityagamaj ¯ n˜ anām¯.śivatattvaṁ paraṁ padam | tasyordhve *kāraṇān (eṁ : kāraṇāḥ Coḍ) pa ñca tyaktvā ¯urdhvaṁtu bhairava<ḥ > k 111 *sāṣt.atantratāntrikānāṁ(?) nityānandaṁ paraṁ padam | samanāntakalātītaṁ vāmadakṣiṇ asaṁsthitam k 112 paṅktikrameṇ a mokṣo ’sti satyaṁ nāsty atra saṁśayaḥ| tasya ¯urdhve parāṣat.kaṁ upary upari saṁsthitam k 113 ṣaḍ ardhaṁ prathamaṁ bhedaṁ bhairavākhyaṁ dvitīyakam | vīrāvalī tr̥tīyaṁ tu caturthaṁ kālikākulam k 114 tatas tvādyāvatāraṁtu tasya ¯urdhvam anāhatam | śrīmatkulālikākhyaṁ‘The final destination of the [Mausula Pa¯supatas,] those ´ who carry a club in their hands, is Mayātattva.

It is striking that this passage omits the SaiddhantikaṣIt is therefore likely that the text has lost a line ¯ or verse here. This suspicion is strengthened by the verses that follow. For in these the order of systems is repeated with śaivam, i.e. the Siddhanta’s scriptures, be- ¯ tween the pāśupatam and the eight Bhairavatantras (v. 128bcd: tathā pāśupataṁ mahat | saivam ´.tasya viśeṣaṁtu bhairavāṣt.akanirṇ ayam). Since the passage also omits Sada¯sivatattva it is probable that it was this level that was assigned to the ´ Saiddhantika system in the lost line or verse. To assign the Saiddh āntikas to ¯ Sada¯sivatattva would, of course, be to disdain their claim that their ´ paraṁ padam is in fact Sivatattva. ´

der’ (dakṣiṇ agharāmnāyaḥ), grouping it with the cult of Kubjika, the cult of ¯ Kal¯ī (Kal¯īkula) in a form attested in the Jayadrathayāmala and the related cor pus of the scriptures of the Krama or Mahanaya, and a form of ¯ S´ akta worship āgreeing closely with that found in the Trika, calling these the teachings of the western, northern, and eastern orders respectively (Pascimaghar ´ amn āya, Ut- ¯ taragharamn āya, and P ¯ urvaghar āmn āya). ¯ 

The S´ aktism of this tetradic schema of the directional ¯ Amn āyas can be dis- ¯ tinguished broadly from the earlier S´ aktism of the Vidy āp¯īt.ha by a marked ten dency to expurgate one of the most conspicuous features of the latter, namely its embeddedness in the intensely transgressive tradition of Kapālika asceti- ¯ cism whose roots lie in the Somasiddhantin division of the Atim ārga. Since the ¯ S´ aktism of the ¯ Amn āyas refers to itself as Kaula we may use this term to des- ¯ ignate these post-Kapālika developmentṣHowever, like most terms applied to ¯ traditions subject to change through time it serves at best to indicate a tendency rather than an absolute distinctioṇ For while the cults of Tripurasundarī and Kubjika adhered to this mode of self-definition and the Trika that developed out ¯ of the Siddhayogeśvarīmata also came to do so,16 the cult of Kal¯ī that came to constitute the Kaulas’ Northern Teaching (uttarāmnāyaḥ) remained both Kaula in its self-definition and firmly Kapālika in its practise. ¯17 

16 On the anti-Kapālika stance of the mature Trika see S ¯ ANDERSON 2005c, pp. 118– 119, fn. 74. 

17 For the Kapālika/Mah āvratin asceticism of practitioners of the Uttar āmn āya, ¯ that is to say of the Kal¯īkula and Krama/Mahanaya, see S ¯ ANDERSON 2007a, pp. 293–294 (Cakrabhanu, ¯¯Is´an¯ī, and Jaiyaka), 323 (Cakrapan¯ .inatha, author of ¯ the Bhāvopahārastotra). Concerning the date of Cakrapāṇinatha I was able to ¯ say in 2007a (p. 417) only that he was earlier than his commentator Ramyadeva, who was later than Kṣemaraja, which is to say, next to nothing. However, ¯ since then I have read a Nepalese manuscript, NGMPP C114/22, which con tains his Bhāvopahārastotra under the title Bhāvopahārap ¯ujā, and this enables us to include him among relatively early authors, since the manuscript is dated in 1158/9. To the Kashmirian exponents of the Krama identified as follow ers of the Kapālika observance in 2007a I now propose to add one more. Ac- ¯ cording to a manuscript of the Chummāsaṁ ketaprakāśa that I had not seen at that time, which contains the final verses of the work that are lacking in the one manuscript that I had seen then, the redactor of this text attributed to Niṣkriyananda was one Ananta ¯ sakti. He is described there as ´ mudrādharaḥ(A, f. 11r7–9): saṁsārasaṁ bhramacayapravibhāgabandhasaṁ bandhasaṁ kṣaya*gatir (eṁ : gater Coḍ) avikalpam ¯urtiḥ| sākṣād anābiladhiyā laghuvākkrameṇ a mudradharas ¯ tu vidadhe tad anantaśaktiḥ. This expression I take to have the same meaning as pa ñcamudrādharaḥ‘wearer of the five sect marks [of the Kapālika/Mah āvratin]’; see, e.g., ¯ Svāyambhuvas ¯utrasaṁ graha, Pat.ala 14 (ṣat.samayabhedaḥ), one of the chapters that is not part of the original work of this name, vv. 19–20: caturdaśapramāṇena yuktaṁ kāpālam ucyate | kāpāle ca vrataṁ mukhyaṁsarvapāpanikr̥ntanam | tasmin vrataṁcared yas tu ṣaṇ māsān mu ktimāpnuyāt | pa ñcamudrādharaḥśāntaḥsamayācārapālakaḥ; and Kubjikāmata [[49]]

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

In general we may say that these non-Saiddhantika texts with their ¯ strongly S´ akta orientation emerged after the Siddh ānta or at least after the ¯ emergence of its earliest scriptureṣThus, for example, it is clear in my view that the Svacchandatantra was redacted after the formation of the Saiddhantika ¯ Niśvāsa corpus, the Tantrasadbhāva after the Svacchanda, the Kubjikāmata after the Tantrasadbhāva,18 the first hexad of the Jayadrathayāmala after the Kubjikāmata,19 and the remaining three hexads after the first.20 However, I see no reason to conclude that all that is found in the non-Saiddhantika corpus is ¯ post-Saiddhantika and some grounds for thinking that some elements may be as ¯ old or older̥ This may be the case with the cult of the four sisters of Tumburu. For that is known to the Buddhist Dharmakīrti (fl. c. 550–650),21 and the first two folios of a post-scriptural text on this cult, the *Devītantrasadbhāvasāra, written in learned style in the Ary ā metre, have survived among the Buddhist ¯ manuscripts uncovered in Gilgit in 1931. They may be assigned on palaeo graphical grounds to around the middle of the sixth century.22 A second area

22 No title appears in the surviving fragment of this text. The title assigned here is a guess based on the unknown author’s description of his work in verses 3 and 4. There he says that he is extracting the fundamentals (sāraḥ) of the Essence of the Tantras (tantrasadbhāvaḥ) of the [four] Goddesses (devīnām) that had been received from Siva by a sage identified only as the ornament of the lin- ´ eage of Atri: 3ātreyavaṅśatilakenoktaṁśarvād avāpya yat p ¯urvaṁ| suramuni narāsurāṇāṁ devīnāṁtantrasadbhāvaṁk 4 tasmād aham apy adhunā vakṣye saṁ hr̥tya sāramāryābhiḥ| spaṣt.atarākṣarapaṅktibhir aviśāladhiyāṁ *prabodhāya (eṁ : pravodhāta Coḍ) ‘The Essence of the Tantras of the Goddesses was received of old from Siva by the ornament of the lineage of Atri and taught to the gods, sages, ´ men, and titanṣI in turn have summarized its fundamentals and shall now declare them in Ary ā verses whose lines of syllables will be completely clear in meaning, for ¯ the instruction of those of modest intellect’. The script is the stage of proto-S´ arad ā¯ that Prof. Lore SANDER has called Gilgit/Bamiyan type 2 and also Sonderschrift 1. I stumbled upon the first folio (3221–3222) while searching the facsimiles of the Gilgit manuscripts for proto-Tantric Buddhist materials and communicated this un expected discovery to Somdev VASUDEVA, then my student, who promptly located the second folio (3340–3341) and presented convincing palaeographical arguments for the date of the manuscript proposed here (email of 7.12.2000), pointing to the presence of the archaic tripartite ya ligature, the occurrence of the old style of hr̥, and the Gupta style ru. The text teaches the Mantras of the four Devīs, who, it says, were made manifest at the beginning of creation so that men could attain supernat-

of the non-Saiddhantika canon that is likely to be very early in origin is that ¯ of the Yamalatantras assigned to the Vidy āp¯īt.ha, represented in our surviving manuscripts by the 12000-verse Picumata, also called the Brahmayāmala. For the Skandapurāṇ a-Ambikākhaṇ ḍ a, whose earliest surviving manuscript was completed in 810, lists seven Yamala texts, beginning with the ¯ Brahmayāmala, as Tantras of the Mother Goddesses (mātr̥tantrāṇi).23 The date of the text itself is still a matter of debate; but it is unlikely to have been composed later than the end of the seventh century or earlier than the sixtḥ24 It is certainly

The Vīṇāśikha, our only complete surviving Tantra of the vāmasrotaḥ, teaches the four Devīs (vv. 30c–32b), Tumburu (vv. 29c–30b), and the Anku ˙ sa (v. 41d etc.), but not the D ´ ut¯īs or KinkaraṣFor the fuller pantheon see, ˙ e.g., Devyāmata, f. 40r1: jayā ca vijayā caiva jayantī cāparājitā | d ¯utibhiḥ kiṅkaraiḥ sārdhaṁsaṁ vr̥tas *tumburuḥ(corr : tumburuṁ Coḍ) sthitaḥ; Netratantra 11.1– 27; and Sāradātilaka ´ 19.87–105b and Tantrasārasaṁ graha 23.37–52 (with the four Dut¯īs but without the Kinkaras). The expression ˙ sārthavāhaḥ‘the [international] trader’ in v. 17b (v. 17ab: praṇ avaṁtuṁ burusahitaṁsārthavāhā +) no doubt refers to Tumburu, who is so described in the Buddhist version of this cult taught in the Ma ñjuśriyam ¯ulakalpa (47.29b, 52a, 54c, p. 413, l. 12, etc.). According to that source the four sisters and Tumburu are to be depicted sailing in a ship with Tumburu at the helm (47.24: nauyānasamār ¯uḍ hā<ḥ > sabhrātr̥sahapa ñcamā<ḥ > | karṇ adhāro *’rthacit (tentative conj. : ’thacit Eḍ) tāsāṁ *tumburunāmasaṁj ñitaḥ(eṁ : tum burur nāma saṁj ñitaḥ Eḍ). See also here p. 130. This depiction is also prescribed in the Saiva ´ Piṅgalāmata, f. 28v5–6 (Citrādhikāra, v. 35): jayādyāś cakragās tadvat paṅktisthā vā likhet | kramāt nāvār ¯uḍ hāś ca vā likhyās tumburuḥ karṇ adhārakaḥ ‘He should depict Jaya[, Vijay ā, Jayant ¯ī,] and [Aparajit ā] forming a circle or in a ¯ line. Alternatively he may depict them on board a ship with Tumburu as the helms man’. For the early date of this cult see also here p. 129. 

23 See SANDERSON 2001, pp. 6–7, fn. 4 and here p. 229 (171.127–130b) and a discus sion of the titles it containṣThe oldest manuscript is dated in the year 234. For this date and its equivalence to A.D. 810 see ADRIAENSEN, BAKKER and ISAAC SON 1994, p. 326. That the era of the date is that of the Licchavi Manadeva ¯ (=Aṁ suvarman) was first proposed by W ´ ITZEL (1986, p. 256, ṇ 9). The date of the commencement of this unnamed era which is seen in Nepalese inscriptions that begin during the reign of the Nepalese king Manadeva was determined to fall in ¯ A.D. 576 on the basis of Tibetan evidence by Luciano PETECH (1961). Previously it had been assumed that the era was that of Harṣa (A.D. 606). 

24 Yuko YOKOCHI has observed (1999a, pp. 81–82) that the icon of the goddess Mahiṣasuramardin ¯ī seen in texts of the sixth and seventh centuries gives way to a new iconic type around the beginning of the eighth century and that this text be longs with the earlier sources in this regarḍ The same scholar has shown (1999b, pp. 68–75) that the description of Mahiṣasuramardin ¯ī in 68.10–23 of the text cor responds most closely to the image of Mahiṣasuramardin ¯ī from Siddhi-kī-Gupha at ¯ Deogarh, an example of her Gupta subtype B2. She argues that this was carved in the middle of the sixth century or, at the latest, at its the end (pp. 74–75). So, she concludes, “the possibility that the text belongs to the same century can no longer

striking in this regard that it betrays no knowledge of the Siddhanta, its ¯ Saivism being Atim ´ argic, ¯25 a circumstance which supports the hypothesis that the polarity seen in the Mantramarga between ¯ Saivism and ´ S´ akta ¯ Saivism ´ was already present in some form when the former was still in the Atimarga ¯ stage.26 Royal devotion to Bhairava certainly goes back before the Siddhanta’s ¯ emergence, being attributed in Vakāt¯ .aka inscriptions to Rudrasena I, who ruled c. 335–c. 360,27 and a copperplate decree issued by Maharāja Bhulun ¯ . ḍ a in 376 from Bagh (Valkha) in Madhya Pradesh records a grant made to support the ¯ worship of the Mothers in a temple of those deities established by an officiant of the Atimarga, the Pāśupat ´ acārya Bhagavat Lokodadhi. ¯28 

In the light of this evidence that S´ aktism was extensively incorporated into ānd developed within Saivism it should not be surprising to discover that in spite ´ of the prevalence of the worship of the Goddess in early medieval India kings 

identified in inscriptions as devotees of the Goddess (bhagavatībhaktaḥ) rather than Siva are very rare. At present I am aware only of N ´ agabhat ¯ .a, Bhoja, and his successor Mahīpala I in the ninth century among the G ¯ urjara-Prat ¯īharas of ¯ Kanyakubja.29 

Royal devotion to a goddess, typically as a dynasty’s lineage deity (kuladevī, vaṁśadevī, gotradevī), was very common during our period, and such deities are often declared in inscriptions to be the source of a king’s sovereignty and mar tial might.30 But this was not sufficient to mark out kings who worshipped such goddesses as S´ aktaṣFor such worship was common regardless of a king’s reli- ¯

25 The Skandapurāṇ a-Ambikākhaṇ ḍ a is not a text of the Atimarga in the sense that ¯ it was written for initiates in one of its systemṣFor since it is a Puran¯ . a its target audience is the uninitiated laity. However, the Saivism that it draws on is P ´ a¯supata ´ rather than Mantramargic. This Atim ārgic background is conspicuous throughout ¯ the text; but see particularly Adhyayas 174–183. ¯

The same for mula appears in all the other surviving copper-plates of this king that are complete at this point (CII 5:1, 4, 6–7, 10, 13–14, 18).

gious affiliation, and it was in any case inconstant, coming to the fore only on cer tain occasions, particularly during the autumnal Navaratra festival that inaugu- ¯ rates the season of military activity, when they and associated goddesses received large-scale animal sacrifices;31 and when this cult was particularly emphasized through the forging of connections with a higher domain of non-periodic, exclu sive devotion, then this domain was that of the esoteric goddesses of the Saiva ´ Vidyap¯īt.ha.32 

THE ETIOLATION AND SUBSUMPTION OF THE CULT OF THE SUN-GOD 

As for the cult of the Sun, kings who have been declared in inscriptions to be devotees of this god (paramasauraḥ, paramādityabhaktaḥ, and the like) are also few and they are mostly confined to the sixth and seventh cen turieṣWe have Dharmaraja of Padmakhol ¯ī in the Ganjam District of Orissa, Dharapat.t.a, the Maitraka of Valabhī, Rajyavardhana, ¯ Adityavardhana, and ¯ Prabhakaravardhana, the three successive predecessors of King Hars ¯ .a of Kanyakubja, in the sixth century, and from c. 570 to c. 665 the Gurjara feuda- ¯ 

31 On Navaratra see S ¯ ANDERSON 2005a, p. 371 (fn. 64); 2005b, pp. 255–257; 2007b, pp. 263–277 and 294 (fn. 196). For an example of the scale of such annual sacrifices see p. 247 below. 

32 In general we may say that the Saivism of the Mantram ´ arga holds itself aloof from ¯ the domain of calendrical religion, seeing the recurrent festivals of that domain as commemorations of mythic events and therefore as operating on a level of mun dane belief that initiates must transcenḍ That is the territory of Puran¯ .ic religion, which guarantees various rewards but not the liberation or supernatural effects and powers promised to observant initiates into the Mantramarga. ¯ Saiva initiates were ´ merely required to track the Puran¯ .ic calendar by intensifying their own regular cult on days when uninitiated devotees were celebrating Siva’s or the Goddess’ activi- ´ ties in the domain of myth-based devotion; see, e.g., Tantrālokaviveka on 28.6d–7b. Nonetheless, we see a distinct tendency for the Mantramarga to seep downwards ¯ into this domain providing Saiva or ´ S´ akta ¯ Saiva versions of the Pur ´ an¯ .ic rituals that mark such major annual festivals as Sivar ´ atri and Navar ātra. A ¯ S´ akta ¯ Saiva ´ procedure for the celebration of Sivar ´ atri was current in Kashmir, as can be seen ¯ from the prescriptions set out in the Nityādisaṁ graha of Rajānaka Taks ¯ .akavarta (ff. 71v–72v15) from the lost D ¯utiḍāmara and in the 31st chapter of the Haracar itacintāmaṇi of Rajānaka Jayadratha in the thirteenth century, drawing on this ānd the Anantabhāskara. The same can be seen in various regions in the case of the Navaratra, also known as the Durgotsava. Among the Newars of the Kathmandu ¯ valley, the goddess is worshipped in this festival in a Tantric form as Ugracaṇ ḍ a¯ in Paddhatis that incorporate her among such Mantramargic ¯ S´ akta deities as ¯ Siddhilakṣmī and Kubjika; see the Newari ¯ Navarātrap ¯ujāvidhi manuscripts A and B in the bibliography. For her Tantric worship in this context in the tradition of the Paippaladin Atharvavedins of Orissa see S ¯ ANDERSON 2007b, pp. 263–276. In Bengal, where Navaratra was and is much emphasized, we see a Sm ārta procedure ¯ but one that has been strongly Tantricized in the Durgāp ¯ujāprayogatattva section of the Durgāp ¯ujātattva of Raghunandana in the 16th century.

tories of Bharukaccha (Broach). This is explicitly stated in the case of Dadda I (r̥ c. 570–595), and Dadda II (r̥ c. 620–645); and it is probable in the case of Jayabhat.a II (r̥ c. 645–665), since it is very likely that the temple of the Sun-god Jayaditya at Kot ¯ .ipura near Kav¯ī in the Broach District was founded by him with his name (Jaya-). It is also probable in the case of Jayabhat.a I (r̥ c. 595–620), since this was the religion not only of his predecessor and successor but also of his brother Raṇ agraha. After Jayabhat.a II the next three kings of this dynasty, Dadda III (c. 665–690), Jayabhat.a III (c. 690–715), and Ahirola (c. 715– 720), turned to Saivism, declaring themselves ´ paramamāheśvaraḥ. In the ninth century we have royal devotees of the Sun in Ramabhadra, the immediate prede- ¯ cessor of the Gurjara-Prat ¯īhara Bhojadeva I of Kanyakubja, and Vin āyakap āla, ¯ the latter’s grandson, and, in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, in the Sena kings of Bengal Lakṣmaṇ asena and Visvar ´ upasena, though the former ālso appears in his inscriptions as a Vaiṣṇ ava (paramavaiṣṇ avaḥ) and, more specifically, as a devotee of Narasiṁ ha (paramanārasiṁ haḥ).33 

It appears that the Sauras, the initiated devotees of the Sun-god, possessed their own canon of scriptures, known, like those of the Saivas and the Vais ´.ṇ ava followers of the Pancar ˜ atra, as Sam ¯ . hitaṣA list of eighty-five such texts is given ¯ in an account of brahmanical, Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika (Vais ¯ .ṇ ava), Saura, and Saiva scrip- ´ tural authorities, contained in the Saiva scripture ´ Srīkan ´.t.hīyasaṁ hitā. No man uscript of this text, which was known to Kṣemaraja ( ¯ fl. c. 1000–1050) and prob ably to Abhinavagupta (fl. c. 975–1025), has come down to us; but I have located its long section dealing with the canons of scripture in the Nityādisaṁ graha of Rajānaka Taks ¯ .akavarta, a Kashmirian digest of scriptural passages bearing on the duties of initiated Saivas, compiled at some time after the eleventh century. ´ 34

Unfortunately, no manuscript of any one of these Saura scriptures has surfaced; and the decline of Saurism as a distinct tradition, of which this is the conse quence and evidence, is probably to be attributed, at least in part, to a failure to continue to attract patronage and so maintain its separate identity as Saivism ´ became more influential and encroached upon its territory. 

Thus a Saurasaṁ hitā of our period sets out the procedure for the worship of the Sun and no doubt drew on the Saura traditioṇ35 But it assigns itself to the canon of the Saiva scripture ´ Vāthula/Kālottara,36 a text on which it silently draws, gives a Saiva account of the place of the Sun in the birth of the uni- ´ verse, deriving it through emergence from Siva expressed in a phrase found ´ elsewhere in the Saiva scriptures, ´ 37 and insists that Siva and the Sun are in ´ essence a single deity.38 Moreover, the worship of the Sun taught in this text was included by the Saiddhantika ¯ Saivas as a compulsory preliminary ( ´ aṅgam) of the regular worship of Siva himself, appearing first in the sources known ´ to me in the Siddhāntasārapaddhati of Maharājādhir āja Bhojadeva of Dh ārā¯ (r̥ c. 1018–1060)39 and then soon afterwards, in dependence on that text, in the

Sāmbapurāṇ a, which teaches the worship of the Sun-god, is also a product, at least in its later portions, of a Saiva environment. ´ 41 

Traces of some form of the vanished tradition of the Sauras may have sur vived in the S´ akta ¯ Saiva literature. For Kashmirian sources know of a ´ S´ akta ¯ cult whose deity was the Sun under the name Vīra or Vīresvara accompanied ´ by the goddess Bhargasikh ´ a, citing as its scripture the Kaula ¯ Bhargaśikhā, also called Saurabhargaśikhā, a work for knowledge of whose content we now have only a few comments in the Kashmirian literature and a few verses quoted in the same, one of which has also been quoted by the east-Indian Buddhist Ramap āla ¯ in his Sekanirdeśapa ñjikā, a fact that demonstrates that this was not a merely a local, Kashmirian traditioṇ42 The probability that this cult reflects a non

Saiva tradition otherwise lost to us is made somewhat greater by the fact that ´ the names Vīresvara and Bharga ´ sikh ´ a are applied in Kashmirian sources, both ¯ Saiva and Sm ´ arta, to the Sun-god and his consort at M ārt ān¯ . ḍ atīrtha (modern Mat.an), where King Lalitaditya built his majestic temple of the Sun in the mid- ¯ eighth century,43 a site that has been a major pilgrimage site with its own special rites for the dead, the Bhargasr´ addha and S ¯ uryabali, down to modern timeṣ¯44 However, it is possible that the application of these names merely reflects the pervasive influence of S´ akta ¯ Saiva esotericism in the wider Kashmirian commu- ´ nity in later timeṣ

There are also strong elements of a solar esotericism in the Kal¯īkula of the Jayadrathayāmala and the Krama.45 It is possible that these too may have been 

na tan nobhayojjhitam | durvij ñeyā hi sāvasthā kim apy etad anuttamam (the verse has been silently incorporated by Abhinavagupta as Tantrāloka 2.28 [with anuttaram not anuttamam]): Jayaratha identifies this as a quotation from the Bhargaśikhā in his commentary: śrībhargaśikhāṁsaṁ vādayati (-viveka, vol. 1, Ahnika ¯ 2, p. 22). 

43 Rājataraṅginī 4.192; Krishna DEVA in EITA, vol. 2, part 1, pp. 363–66; plates 710–721; AIISPL, Accession numbers 20738–20789 and 60003–60051. The Mārtāṇ ḍ amāhātmya, the praise-text of this site, refers to Surya here as V ¯īresvara ´ (Bhr̥ṅgīśasaṁ hitā, p. 15: eṣa vīreśvaro devaḥ paraḥ paramakāraṇ am; p. 63: vīreśāya namas tubhyaṁ; p. 66: namo vīrādhivīreśa) and makes Bhargasikh ´ a the ¯ first of his Saktis ( ´ibiḍ, p. 12, listing Bhargasikh ´ a, Bh ¯īma, Bh āsvat ¯ī and Bhanav ¯ī). The Sun is also invoked as Vīresvara in the worship of the Grahas that occurs ´ among the preliminaries in Saiva rituals in Kashmir; see ´ Kalādīkṣāpaddhati B f. 4v9–10: tadbahir grahāḥ. tatrādau madhye s ¯uryaḥ OM.

44 For the Paddhati of these rituals see Karmakāṇ ḍ a, vol. 4, pp. 140–205. Here too the Sun is invoked as Vīra/Vīresvara (p. 196): ´ vīra vīreśa deveśa namas te ’stu tridhātmaka | mahāmārtaṇ ḍ a varada sarvābhayavaraprada . . . .

The cult of the Sun-god, then, appears to have survived in India after the rise of the Saivism only in heavily ´ Saivized Pur ´ an¯ .ic reflexes or subordinated in a Saivized form within the Saiddh ´ antika cult of ¯ Siva, and, perhaps, in some ele- ´ ments within the S´ akta ¯ Saiva traditioṇ Only in the Majapahit kingdom of East ´ Java do we hear of the survival of adherents of a distinct Saura denominatioṇ There a royal charter of c. 1350 tells us that a board of six learned men appointed to adjudicate law suits included two adherents of this traditioṇ46

Royal preference for Vaiṣṇ avism, expressed in inscriptions by the epithets atyantabhagavadbhaktaḥ, paramabhāgavataḥ, or paramavaiṣṇ avaḥ, all mean ing ‘entirely devoted to Viṣṇ u’, is mostly confined to the period from the fourth century to the seventḥ The Bhagavata faith was adopted and promoted by ¯ the Guptas from the first half of the fourth century through to the end of the fifth,47 and it was probably under their influence that it gained a foothold in the fifth century among the Saiva V ´ akāt¯ .aka rulers of Nandivardhana in east ern Vidarbha, through the marriage in the last decade of the fourth century of the Vakāt¯ .aka Rudrasena II to Prabhavat ¯īgupta, the daughter of the ¯ parama bhāgavataḥ Gupta emperor Candragupta II (c. 380–474).48 Gupta influence may also explain the appearance of the Bhagavata faith at the end of the fourth cen- ¯

were the later Maukhariṣ59 

After the seventh century royal Vaiṣnavism is sporadic, with the prominent exception of the Karkot ¯ .as of Kashmir (c. 625–855/6). The conclusion that this dynasty was Vaiṣṇ ava is not derived from our study of inscriptions, because extremely few have survived the centuries of Islamic rule in Kashmir, which began in 1339 and ended in 1819. It rests primarily on the testimony of the Rājataraṅgiṇī of the Kashmirian historian Kalhaṇ a, who did have access to, and did utilize, the local epigraphic record of religious foundations and dynastic history.60 From this work we can see that when a king of this dynasty established and enshrined a deity, generally with his own name (svanāmnā), it was always a Viṣṇ u (-svamin, -ke ¯ sava), though sometimes images of the ´ Sun-god or the Buddha were enshrined in additioṇ These royal Viṣṇ us are the Durlabhasvamin (4.6) of Durlabhavardhana (r̥ ¯ c. 626–662), the Tribhu vanasvamin (4.78) of Candr āp¯īḍ a (r̥ c. 712-720/1), the Muktasvamin (4.188) of ¯ Lalitaditya-Mukt āp¯īḍ a (725-761/2), his silver Parihasake ¯ sava at his new town ´ Parihasapura (4.195, 202), his golden Mukt āke ¯ sava (4.196, 201), and a Vis ´ .ṇ u at his new town Darpitapura (4.183), the Vipulakesava (4.484) of Jay ´ ap¯īḍ a (r̥ c. 773/4-804/5), and his Caturatmake ¯ sava and Ananta ´ sayana Vis ´ .ṇ u at his new town Jayapura (4.508), the Amr̥takesava established after his death by his ´ mother Amr̥taprabha to secure the rescue from hell that the sins of his later ¯ life had made his certain destiny (4.659), and the Viṣṇ us established by each of the five uncles of Cippat.ajayap¯īḍ a, who ran the country for thirty-seven years during the reign of the puppet king Ajitap¯īḍ a (r̥ c. 813/4–850/1): Utpalasvamin ¯

59 On the Saiva affiliation of the Maukharis ´ ¯Is´anavarman, ¯ Sarvavarman, and Avanti- ´ varman see BAKKER and ISAACSON 2004, pp. 32–33; THAPLYAL 1985: B 2, ll. 19– 20; B 3, ll. 7–8; B 5, ll. 7–8. Another lineage that may have been Vaiṣṇ ava up to the early seventh century before turning to Saivism is that of the Varmans of ´ Pragjyotis ¯ .a. Bhutivarman of that line was ¯ paramabhāgavataḥ according to his Baḍ agang˙ a rock inscription of 553/4 ( ¯ EI 27:5, ll. 1–2): śrī paramadaivataparama bhāgavatamahārājādhirājāśvamedhajājin[āṁ] śrībh ¯utivarmadevapādānāṁ. But his great-great-grandson, Bhaskaravarman (r̥ ¯ c. 600–50), has been described in his Dub¯ī copper-plate inscription as having revived Saivism; see S ´IRCAR 1983a:1, ll. 109–110): lakṣmīḥ kṣībavilāsa[nīta]vidhinā saṁskr̥tya ca svīkr̥tā bh ¯uyo yena ma heśvarāśrayanayaḥsphāyipratāpārciṣā.

(4.695ab), Padmasvamin (4.695cd), Dharmasv āmin (4.697ab), Kaly ān¯ . asvamin ¯ (6.697cd), and Mammasvamin (4.698–699). ¯ 

Kalhaṇ a reports only one Saiva foundation by a king of this dynasty, and this ´ is a special case. For it was not the creation of a new Siva with the king’s name, ´ 

but merely the building by Lalitaditya of a new stone temple to house the ancient ¯ Siva Jyes ´.t.hesvara at the site of ´ Siva Bh ´ ute ¯ svara (4.190) in the context of offer- ´ ings to clear his debt to the latter incurred when he had appropriated the wealth of this temple to finance his military campaigns (4.189). Devotion to Viṣṇ u was also the preference of Avantivarman (r̥ 855/6–883), the first king of the next dy nasty, and in keeping with his personal faith he installed an Avantisvamin before ¯ his consecratioṇ But thereafter he showed himself a Saiva in unison with the ´ faith of his powerful minister S´ura, establishing a ¯ Siva Avant ´īsvara and mak- ´ ing donations to the Sivas of the national ´ Siva-temples, confessing to ´ S´ura his ¯ long-hidden devotion to Viṣṇ u only at death’s door (5.43, 123–125).61 

Vaiṣṇ avism gained ground again only towards the end of our period, and in subsequent centurieṣ62 Before that happened, while it remained in the shadow of Saivism, it gave rise to a new literature of scriptural texts known collectively ´ as the Pancar ˜ atra, that was probably composed in and around Kashmir̥ A form ¯ of Vaiṣṇ avism bearing this name is already mentioned in the Mahābhārata.63 It is very probable, therefore, that it was in existence well before the Saiva ´ 

Mantramarga. However, there is no evidence that this early Pa ¯ ncar ˜ atra had ā Tantric ritual system of the kind that characterizes the Saṁ hitas of the sur- ¯ viving corpus of Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika scripture. It is highly probable in my view that ¯ 

those texts are rather the product of a thorough reformation in which Vaiṣṇ avas followed the example of the already flourishing Saiva Mantram ´ arga in order to ¯ 

provide themselves with a substantially new ritual system that would enable them to compete more effectively with their rivalṣ64

62 Vaiṣṇ avas who left their mark in the domains of the major S´ astras, belles-lettres, ānd literary theory are few during our centurieṣThe shift in the fortunes of Vaiṣṇ avism is marked by the emergence of such influential religious leaders as Ramānuja (ḍ 1137), Madhva (probably 1238–1317), Nimb ārka (thirteenth cen- ¯ tury), Viṣṇ usvamin (thirteenth century?), Vallabha, and Caitanya (both late fif- ¯ teenth century). For an excellent survey of the history of these Vaiṣṇ ava traditions see COLAS 2003.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

I am led to this conclusion by the convergence of various considerationṣFirstly, the ritual system prescribed in the Pancar ˜ atra scriptures is remarkably ¯ close to that of the Saiva Mantram ´ arga in its repertoire, consisting principally ¯ of Maṇ ḍ ala initiation (dīkṣā), regular worship comprising Nyasa, P ¯ uj ā, Japa ānd Homa, the periodic ritual of pavitrāropaṇ am, special rites of Mantra propitiation (mantrārādhanam), and image-installation (pratiṣt.hā); and this proximity extends into the minute details of the procedures of these rituals and even to the production of Vaiṣṇ ava versions of such eminently Saiva rites as the ´ vetālasādhanaṁ65 

Secondly, I see no evidence that any of the surviving Pancar ˜ atra texts goes ¯ back as far the Saiva texts that they so closely resemble. Seven can be shown ´ to be relatively old because they have been cited by authors of the tenth cen tury or have come down to us in early Nepalese palm-leaf manuscriptṣThese are the Svāyambhuvapa ñcarātra, the Devāmr̥trapa ñcarātra, the Vāsudevakalpa of the Mahālakṣmīsaṁ hitā, the Jayottara, the Jayākhya, the Sātvata, and the Pauṣkara. Now, of these, three, namely the Jayottara, the Jayākhya, and the Sātvata, are very unlikely to have been produced before the ninth century, that is to say, at a time when the Saiva Mantram ´ arga had been flourishing under ¯ widespread royal patronage for at least two centuries and had been existence in some form by a time no later than the middle of the sixth and perhaps as early as the middle of the fiftḥ For all three focus on the worship of a form of Vasudeva, ¯ called Vaikuṇt.ha in the Jayākhya and Jayottara and Sakty ´ atman or ¯ Sakt ´īsa in ´ the Sātvatasaṁ hitā, in which the principal anthropomorphic face is flanked by the faces of Narasiṁ ha and Varaha, with a fourth face, that of the sage Kapila, āt the rear̥66 Surviving stone and bronze images of this deity are numerous, but they are three-faced, lacking the face of Kapila at the rear, until the ninth century.67 

Thirdly, these early Pancar ˜ atra texts show clear signs of having drawn on ¯ Saiva sourceṣThis is particularly obvious in the ´ Svāyambhuvapa ñcarātra, to which we have access in a single, incomplete Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript bearing a date of transcription that falls in A.D. 1026.68 The principal Mantra of

The Saiva prototypes are already found in the Atim ´ arga of the P ā¯nc˜ arthika ¯ Pa¯supataṣIndeed they constitute the whole Mantra-system of that traditioṇ ´ However, it is clear that the Svāyambhuvapa ñcarātra has drawn them from the later tradition of the Mantramarga, because it goes on to teach the imposition on ¯ to the worshipper’s body of the thirty-eight parts of these Mantras (kalānyāsaḥ), a Mantramargic feature, and under names specific to one Mantram ārgic tradi- ¯ tion, that of the Svacchandatantra, the principal scripture of the Mantrapīt.ha.70 

The Svāyambhuvapa ñcarātra survives only in this Nepalese manuscript. One might object, therefore, that it may be no more than a local oddity unrep resentative of the mainstream traditioṇ That it is not can be argued, of course, only through evidence that the text was more widely known in the form of ref erences to it, citations from it, or accounts of its contents in other workṣThis is a difficult test to apply in the case of the early Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika literature, since ¯ in stark contrast to the case of the Saiva scriptures, P ´ a¯ncar ˜ atrika commentarial ¯ works in which we could seek such evidence are almost completely absent un til a much later period among the Sr´īvaiṣṇ avas of the South, when the range of relevant sources had changed greatly. The only exception is the Spandapra dīpikā of the Kashmirian Bhagavatotpala, probably of the tenth century. ¯71 But that, though it cites a number of early Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika scriptural sources, does not ¯ cite thiṣHowever, there is evidence in a Saiva source that this P ´ a¯ncar ˜ atrika ¯ text was known and followed outside Nepal. For I propose that it is identi cal with the Svayambh ¯upa ñcarātra that Somasambhu cites as his authority in ´ 

his account of the procedures for the installation of an image of Viṣṇ u in the Kriyākāṇ ḍ akramāvalī,72 the highly influential work on the Saiddhantika ¯ Saiva ´

71 I am aware of no reference to the Spandapradīpikā or its author in any dated work. It is not possible, therefore, to fix a date before which this work must have been written, at least not a date earlier than that of its manuscriptṣHowever, the fact that it quotes extensively from the S´ akta ¯ Saiva literature current in Kashmir up to ´ and including the ¯Iśvarapratyabhij ñākārikā of Utpaladeva (fl. c. 925–975) but not from any of the works of Abhinavagupta (fl. c. 975–1025) makes it unlikely that its author wrote after the latter̥

rituals73 that he composed in the eleventh century, probably in 1073,74 while he held the office of abbot in the kingdom of the Kalacuris of Tripurī at the illus trious Saiddhantika monastery of Golag ¯ī (golagīmat.haḥ), in the Rewa District of Madhya Pradesḥ75 

My conclusion that Somasambhu was referring to our ´ Svāyambhuvapa ñca rātra does not rest solely on the synonymity of the titles, both meaning ‘The Pancar ˜ atra taught to Brahm ā’, but also on the fact that the brief but detailed āccount of the ritual that Somasambhu attributes to the ´ Svayambh ¯upa ñcarātra corresponds in its particulars to the coverage of the same topic found in the seventh Adhyaya of the text in our manuscript. I cannot demonstrate this ¯ in full detail here. But it should suffice to point out that the system that Somasambhu attributes to his ´ Svayambh ¯upa ñcarātra features an unusual arrangement of three circuits of Mantra-deities that agrees exactly with that of our Svāyambhuvapa ñcarātra manuscript: nine on a lotus with eight petals (one at the centre and one on each of the petals), twelve in a circle with that lotus at its centre, and eight forming a circuit enclosing the whole. The twelve are the Viṣṇ umurtis, embodying each of the twelve syllables of the root-Mantra ¯ (m ¯ulamantraḥ); the outer eight are the eight weapons (astrāṇi) held by the presiding deity; and the nine of the innermost circuit (garbhāvaraṇ am) are a set of ancillary Mantras: the Hr̥daya at the centre surrounded by the Siras (E), ´ the Sikh ´ a (S), the Kavaca (W), the Astra (N), the G āyatr ¯ī (SE), the Savitr ¯ī (NE), the Netra (SW), and the Pingal ˙ astra (NW). ¯76 Since this arrangement is highly 

73 Of the various Paddhatis on the Saiddhantika rituals that have come down to us ¯ Somasambhu’s was probably the most influential. Its impact can be seen in the ´ major later works of this type, such as the Kriyākramadyotikā of Aghorasiva, the ´ J ñānaratnāvalī of Jn˜ana ¯ siva, and the ´ Siddhāntaśekhara of Visvan ´ atha, and in the ¯ fact that manuscripts of the text have survived throughout the subcontinent, in Kashmir, Nepal, and the Soutḥ There is also the fact that it alone achieved the distinction of being stripped of its human authorship to be passed off as scripture. For it was incorporated almost in its entirety in the Agnipurāṇ a (SANDERSON in BRUNNER 1998, p. lix, fn. 81); and much of it was taken over in the late south-Indian Saiddhantika scriptures ¯ Cintyaviśvasādākhya and Uttarakāmika (BRUNNER 1998, p. lviii–lix).

unusual, especially in its set of nine ancillaries, it is extremely unlikely that Somasambhu’s ´ Svayambh ¯upa ñcarātra is not the Svāyambhuvapa ñcarātra of the Nepalese manuscript. Since Somasambhu was a major figure and writing ´ far from Nepal for a pan-Indian audience there are no grounds for considering this tradition to be a Nepalese aberratioṇ 

Furthermore, while the ritual systems taught in the scriptures of the Pancar ˜ atra are generally coherent, no less so than those of the ¯ Saivas, the texts ´ retain elements that make sense in the Saiva world but not in the Vais ´.ṇ ava;

and in some cases we find a degree of awkwardness that is consistent only with a clumsy attempt to adapt Saiva materials to their new context. ´ A striking example of this can be seen in the Jayākhya. When detailing the process of initation it describes the pāśas ¯utram, the cord which is ritually trans formed into a substitute of the subtle body of the candidate, containing all the reality-levels along its length, to be used in the process of rendering the past ac tions that bind his soul incapable of giving rise to future consequences at any of these levelṣIn the course of this description we find some elements alien to the Vaiṣṇ ava tradition that derive, with minimal distortion, from the Saiva doctrinal ´ context. Thus it speaks of this cord as embodying kalā, avidyā, and rāgaḥ, and, shortly afterwards, as coloured by rāgaḥ, illuminated by avidyā, circumscribed by kālaḥ, and rendered non-pervasive by niyatiḥ.77 Now the first three of these factors (rāgaḥ, avidyā, and kalā) are the Saiva Mantram ´ arga’s three ‘shrouds’ ¯

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

(ka ñcukāni), except that there the second is generally termed vidyā rather than avidyā; and the other two factors, kālaḥ and niyatiḥjoin these three to form the group of five reality-levels (tattvāni) ranked immediately below māyātattvam, the upper limit and source of the ‘impure cosmos’ (aśuddho ’dhvā), and immedi ately above the individual soul (puruṣaḥ), constituting the factors that enable the soul to undergo embodiment in that impure worlḍ78 Even the substitu tion of avidyā for the Saivas’ ´ vidyā does nothing to dilute the obviously Saiva ´ character of the set, since vidyā in that context is indeed a form of nescience (avidyā), being understood as the limited power of knowledge that characterizes bound souls, enabling them to cognize the objects presented by the faculties, as opposed to the pure, all-encompassing knowledge (śuddhavidyā) that operates above māyātattvam; and this understanding is maintained in the passage in the Jayākhya, because it speaks of the bonds as being ‘illuminated’ by avidyā. Indeed the line in which the bonds are said to be ‘coloured by rāgaḥ and illuminated by avidyā’ unmistakeably echoes loci classici on the functions of rāgaḥ and vidyā in the Mantramarga’s scriptureṣ¯79 

The Sātvata and the Pauṣkara are probably the latest of these early textṣThey are certainly the most polished and the most sophisticated in language. Unsurprisingly, these more mature products of the tradition contain no glar ingly obvious examples that I can see of imperfectly assimilated Saiva material. ´ Nonetheless, there are parallels in which the Saiva version seems more likely ´ to have been the model of the Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika than ¯ vice versa. Thus the nine teenth chapter of the Pauṣkara teaches as the text’s major initiation Maṇ ḍ ala (mahāyāgaḥ) an arrangement of eight lotuses around a central ninth, calling it the navapīt.hamaṇ ḍ alam, navābjamaṇ ḍ alam, or navanābhamaṇ ḍ alam,80 and a 

78 For rāgaḥ, vidyā, and kalā as the three ‘shrouds’ (ka ñcukatrayam) of the Saivas ´ see, e.g., Mataṅgapārameśvara, Vidyāpāda 11.33: rāgavidyākalākhyena ka ñcu katritayena vai; and Rauravas ¯utrasaṁ graha 1.3–4: rāgavidyākalāvyaktaguṇ a buddhisamudbhavam, where they are the three ‘shrouds’ (ka ñcukāni) of the bound soul. For the addition of kālaḥ and niyatiḥseen in the last verse of the Jayākhya passage (16.134) see, e.g., Mataṅgapārameśvara, Vidyāpāda 14.2: ka ñcukatritayāviddhaṁ kālena kalitaṁśanaiḥ| niyatyāliṅgitaṁ yāti puṁ bhāvenātmavartinā; and Tantrāloka 9.204: māyā kalā rāgavidye kālo niyatir eva ca | ka ñcukāni ṣaḍ uktāni.

long invocatory Mantra consisting of eighty-one units distributed one by one on the centre (nābhiḥ) and eight petals of each of the nine lotuseṣThis arrange ment and correlation, which, to my knowledge, is found in the Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika liter- āture only in the Pauṣkara, is central to the Saiva tradition of the Mantram ´ arga, ¯ being the hallmark of a number of its earlier scriptures, where the Maṇ ḍ ala is taught under the same names,81 and the Mantra with which it is correlated is the well-known Saiva Vyomavy ´ apimantra of eighty-one unitṣIn the ¯ Saiva case the ´ nine lotus-thrones (pīt.haḥ) of the Maṇ ḍ ala are equated with nine Tattvas: Siva, ´ Sada¯siva, ´¯Isvara, Vidy ´ a, Māyā, K āla, Niyati, Purus ¯ .a, and Avyakta (Prakr̥ti). In the Pauṣkara that element has been dropped, no Vaiṣṇ ava set of nine Tattvas being available for this purpose and the Saiva set being unassimilable because it ´ includes unmistakeably Saiva elements such as Sad ´ a¯siva and ´¯Isvara. Nonethe- ´ less the text contains a sign that the redactor was after all working with a Saiva ´ exemplar̥ For he calls his fourth ‘the lotus of Mayā’. ¯82 Mayā is a ¯ Saiva not a ´ Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika Tattva. ¯

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Nor was the influence of the Saivism of the Mantram ´ arga confined to the ¯ formative period of the Tantric Pancar ˜ atra. For, as I have shown elsewhere, the ¯ Lakṣmītantra and Ahirbudhnyasaṁ hitā, works composed in the South, derive their distinctive doctrinal character from the assimilation of the dynamic non dualism of the works of the Kashmirian S´ akta ¯ Saivas from Utpaladeva (fl. ´ c. A.D. 925–975) to Kṣemaraja (fl. ¯ c. 1000–1050).84 

ROYAL PATRONAGE OF BUDDHISM 

Buddhism enjoyed widespread royal support during this period, notably from the Viṣṇ ukuṇ ḍis of Andhra in the fifth and sixth centuries, from the ¯ Maitrakas of Valabhī in Sauras¯ .t.ra in the sixth and seventh, from the Karkot ¯ .as of Kashmir in the eighth, and throughout our period from the Licchavi and ‘T. hakur ¯ī’ kings of Nepal and various dynasties of eastern India, most notably the Palas (r̥ ¯ c. 750–1200). 

The Viṣṇ ukuṇ ḍis of Andhra ¯ 

Among the eight successive Viṣṇ ukuṇ ḍis (r̥ c. 375–612) known to us from in scriptions three of the last six are known to have been patrons of Buddhism: the third, Govindavarman I (r̥ c. 422–462), the fifth, Vikramendravarman I (r̥ c. 502– 527), and the seventh, Vikramendravarman II (r̥ c. 555–572). In the Tummala guḍ em plates (Set I) issued by Maharāja Govindavarman I he is described as ¯ having beautified his kingdom with many temples and Buddhist monasteries, as having given generously to brahmins and Buddhist monks, as having resolved to attain the Great Awakening for the salvation of all living beings, and as having donated two villages—the charter’s object is to record this grant—to fund the

The Kārkot.as of Kashmir 

No inscriptions have survived from the reigns of the kings of the Karkot ¯ .a dynasty of Kashmir̥ But from the account of this dynasty given by the Kashmi ran historian Kalhaṇ a we learn that although, as we have seen, the temples they established with their names were Viṣṇ us,95 they or those closely associated with them also established several Buddhist foundations: the Anantabhavanavihara ¯ founded by the queen of Durlabhavardhana (r̥ c. 626–662); the Praka¯sik´ avih āra ¯ founded by Praka¯sadev ´ī, queen of Candrap¯īḍ a (r̥ c. 712–720/1); the Rajavih āra ¯ ‘The King’s Monastery’ founded and richly endowed by Lalitaditya (r̥ ¯ c. 725– 761/2) with a large Caitya and a huge Buddha image at his new capital Parihasapura; the Kayyavih āra, founded during the rule of the same by Kayya, ā king of Lat¯ .a; a Vihara, a St ¯ upa, and golden Buddha images established at ¯ Parihasapura by Lalit āditya’s Central Asian chief minister Ca ¯ nkun ˙ . a; a Vihara ānd a Caitya established by the same in the capital; and a large monastery and three Buddha images established by Jayap¯īḍ a (r̥ c. 773/4–804/5) in his new capital Jayapura.96 

94 See, e.g., the Alīṇ a copper-plate inscription of ¯ S´īladitya VII of ¯ A.D. 766/7, CII:39. There all the kings listed are said to be paramamāheśvaraḥ: the general Bhat.arka, ¯ the founder of the dynasty, followed, after an unspecified number of generations, by Guhasena, Dharasena (II), S´īladitya (I), Kharagraha (I), Dharasena (III), Dhru- ¯ vasena (II), Dharasena (IV), Dhruvasena (III), Kharagraha (II), S´īladitya (II), ¯ S´īladitya (III), ¯ S´īladitya (IV), ¯ S´īladitya (V), and ¯ S´īladitya (VI).

It consists for the most part of chronological genealogy, giving dates of birth, length of reign, and age at deatḥ The third (ff. 36v–63v + another f. 50), in Old Newari, is an annalistic chronicle whose main concern is to record religious foundations, with entries extending from 1258/9 to 1388/9.

101 The manuscript gives the name Visvadeva here, but as the editors propose, this ´ is surely an error for Vr̥ṣadeva (f. 20r2–3): rājā śrīviśvadeva varṣa 100 tena kr̥ta sīnaguvihāra caityabhat.t.ārike pratiṣt.hita saṁ p ¯urṇ a kr̥taṁ The identification of this with the famous Svayambhunāth Caitya is evident from the name S ¯īnagu, which corresponds to Syangu, its modern Newari name. ˙ 

102 This identification follows from the fact that the Bodhnath Stupa is known as Khasa ¯ Caitya in Newari. On these early Nepalese Caityas—this term rather than Stupa ¯ is the normal uage in Nepal—see GUTSCHOW 1997, pp. 85–99.

Narendradeva in 643 the king’s belt was adorned with a Buddha.115 But here too we see that the support of Buddhism in Nepal as elsewhere was not a sign that a king had changed his religious allegiance in any radical sense.

The T. hākurī Kings of Nepal 

Between the Licchavis, who last appear in the epigraphical record in 737, and the Malla kings, who ruled from 1200–1768, lies the relatively obscure period of the so-called T. hakur ¯ī kingṣThese too, though predominantly Saiva, ´ supported Buddhist institutionṣOnly one, Siṁ hadeva (r̥ 1110–1126), has been declared paramasaugataḥ;117 but several of the monasteries of the Kathmandu valley are attributed to kings of this period in inscriptions, palm-leaf deeds, manuscript colophons, or their own tradition: the Padmacakramahavih āra to ¯ Guṇ akamadeva I, ¯118 the Jyotirmahavih āra (Jyo B āhāh¯ .) and Dattamahavih āra ¯ 

115 The report of this encounter has been incorporated in chapter 221 of the Jiu Tang shu (Old History of the Tang Dynasty), covering the years 618–906 and compiled in 940–945. In a translation of this passage published by Sylvain LEVI ´ (1894, p. 67) we read “Leur roi Na-ling ti-po (Narendra Deva) . . . a . . . des breloques a sa ceinture, ` ornees d’un ´ Fou-tou (Buddha?)”. In a footnote he explains the question mark, say ing that the use of fou-tou for ‘Buddha’ in the seventh century is problematic. But when he re-published his translation (1905a, vol. 1, p. 164) he removed the question mark.

The historicity of Campadeva and Devaladeva, the remaining two kings men- ¯ tioned by the Gopālarājavaṁśāvalī as the founders of monasteries, is doubtful.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

In this [city] was born Anandadeva, a jewel in the pearl-necklace of the lineage ¯ of Raghu, delighting the people like a gentle moon with its most charming rayṣBeing self-controlled and of indescribable greatness, though he had achieved the status of prince (kumāra-) of great power (/though he had achieved the status [only] of Kumara who brandishes the javelin), he achieved when initiated by ¯ [Rudrasiva] the ultimate attainment of ´ Siva[hood]. Likewise Arjunadeva, Ar- ´ juna’s equal in martial valour and a lover of virtues, conceived as great a de votion to this [Rudrasiva] as to the gods, when he had seen his virtueṣAs for the ´ learned Vasantadeva, the wise Somesvara, and Ya ´ somalla, those princes too were ´ initiated by the same [Guru]. 

Neither Arjunadeva nor Yasomalla are otherwise known from this ill- ´ documented phase of Nepalese history. But we do have records of both a Vasantadeva, who was born in 1112 and died in 1163 but did not rule, and of a Somesvaradeva, who was born in 1119, died in 1182, and ruled from 1178 to ´ 1183/5.125 

The Bhauma-Karas of Orissa 

But it was in the region of the modern territories of Bihar, West Bengal, Bangladesh, and Orissa that Buddhism enjoyed its most spectacular success in these centurieṣIt is only there that we find dynasties whose commitment to Buddhism was such that it was commonly signalled in their inscriptions through the use of such epithets as paramasaugataḥ and paramatāthāgataḥ‘entirely devoted to the Buddha’. Notable among these are the early Bhauma-Karas of Orissa (r̥ c. 825–950),126 the early Candras of southeast Bengal (r̥ c. 850–1050), and, above all, the Pala emperors of Gaud ¯ . a (r̥ c. 750–1199), who at the height of their power extended their authority throughout eastern India and beyonḍ127 

the Yuvaraja at the time of his initiatioṇ ¯ 

125 See PETECH 1984, pp. 64–67 and 71–72, and the Genealogical Table A, p. 229. 126 The name Bhauma-Kara is Indological. The early inscriptions speak of these rulers as Bhaumas and the later as Karas, evidently after the -kara that ends most of their nameṣ

127 The Palas and their successors, the Senas, are regularly described as kings of Gaud ¯ . a (gauḍeśvaraḥ, gauḍendraḥ, gauḍ arājaḥ, gauḍādhipaḥ, gauḍ apatiḥ, etc.); see, e.g., SIRCAR 1983a:26, l. 33 (Lakṣmaṇ asena); here pp. 108 (Nayapala) and 109 (Palap āla, ¯ Mahīpala); ¯ Saduktikarṇāmr̥ta 1449, 1496. The name Gauḍ a in its narrow sense refers to a territory covering parts of West Bengal, being distinguished from Mag adha, Vanga, and A ˙ nga. But with expansion of the power of its rulers it came to ˙ denote a much larger territory.

Of the early Bhauma-Kara kings of Orissa Kṣemankara, who probably ˙ reigned around the beginning of the ninth century, is described in inscriptions as a paramopāsakaḥ‘a dedicated lay Buddhist’, his son and successor Sivakara I as ´ paramatāthāgataḥ, his son and successor Subh ´ akara I, as ¯ paramasaugataḥ and paramopāsakaḥ, his son and successor Sivakara II as ´śrīsugatāśrayaḥ‘having the venerable Buddha as his refuge’, and his son Subh ´ akaradeva II, who reigned āfter his father’s brother S´ antikara I ālias Gayad¯ . a, as paramasaugataḥ.128 A copper-plate of Tribhuvanamahadev ¯ī, the Vaiṣṇ ava (paramavaiṣṇ avī) wife of S´ antikara I, who occupied the throne as queen after the reign of her son ¯ Subh ´ akara III ālias Kusumahara, records that ¯ Subh ´ akara (I), her husband’s ¯ father, built a lofty Buddhist monastery;129 another issued by her records that the earlier kings of her line had adorned the land with many Mat.has, Buddhist monasteries, and temples;130 and a third issued c. 980 by the para mamāheśvaraḥ Sivakara III ´ alias Lalitahara, the son of her grandson ¯ Sivakara ´ II, records the granting of a village in favour of a temple of the Buddha in Uttaratosalī made through him by his vassal Ran¯ . aka Vinītatunga. ˙131

tronage of these kings that enabled Mahayāna Buddhism to grow and prosper as ¯ it did in Orissa, with the Tantric forms of that religion coming to the fore from the eighth century.132 This efflorescence is attested by both archaeology and tex tual evidence. Excavations of the Ratnagirimahavih āra in the Cuttack district, ¯ not far from Guhesvarap ´ at¯ .aka, the Bhauma-Kara capital at or near the modern Jajpur, have revealed that this foundation underwent phenomenal expansion up ¯ to the twelfth century,133 and this is only the foremost of several Buddhist sites in Orissa in which Tantric Buddhism is evident in the surviving statuary.134 The extremely high quality of Ratnagiri’s stone-work renders it improbable that it was not a royal foundatioṇ We have at least one Tantric text that reports that it was written here: the Saṁ varodayā nāma Maṇ ḍ alopāyikā of Bhuvācārya, which ¯ survives in a Nepalese manuscript copied in 1050 in the Manadevamah āvih āra ¯ (Chuka Bahāh¯ .);135 and a manuscript of the Vimalaprabhā, the great commen tary on the Kālacakratantra, penned in the early decades of the twelfth century, in the thirty-ninth year of the reign of Harivarman, has a postscript in another hand added seven years later which locates the manuscript not far from Ratna giri near the Benga river̥136 Indeed Ratnagiri had a particularly close associa tion with the propagation of that Tantra according to the Tibetan account of the

The Candras of South-East Bengal 

As for the Candras, they used the wheel of the Buddha’s teaching (dharma cakram) as the seal-symbol on their charters; the Pascimbh ´ ag copper-plate grant ¯ of Sr´īcandra I (r̥ c. 925–75) describes both this king and his predecessor Trailoky acandra as paramasaugataḥ;139 and his Ramp āl and Madanpur copper-plate ¯ grants describe Suvarṇ acandra, the predecessor of Trailokyacandra (r̥ c. 900– 925), as a bauddhaḥ‘a follower of the Buddha’s teachings’.140 After Trailokya candra came Sr´īcandra (II), Kalyan¯ . acandra, Laḍ ahacandra, and Govindacandra.

This is not accurate, since the text says not that he became a Buddhist but only that he was one: buddhasya yaḥśaśaka jātakam aṅkasaṁsthaṁ bhaktyā bibharti k bhagavān amr̥tākarāṁśuḥ| candrasya tasya kulajāta itīva bauddha[ḥ] putraḥśruto jagati tasya suvarṇ acandraḥ‘His son was Suvarṇ acandra, famed in the world, a Buddhist as though [simply] because he was born in the lineage of the Moon (/the Candra lineage), which out of devotion to the Buddha displays his incarnation as a hare in its markings’.

Unfortunately the names of this king and his ancestors have been lost through the scissoring off of strips from the top and right hand side of the plate. However, what remains conveys the unexpected information that all these kings were paramamāheśvaraḥ. The editor of the in scription assigns it to the sixth century on the grounds of its close palaeographic similarity to the grants of Nīticandra and Vīracandra, and argues that if the first of the six kings was, as is likely, Dvencandra, the founder of the Candra dynasty, ˙ then the king in question was Nīticandra’s father Bhuticandra (r̥ ¯ c. 496–520).151 Vīracandra, he argues, is excluded by the fact that one of the two Vesal¯ī inscrip tions records his patronage of Buddhisṁ However, that a king should give to Buddhism and at the same time be declared a paramamāheśvaraḥin documents issued by the royal chancellery is quite within the bounds of possibility, as we have seeṇ

of Mahayāna Buddhism in all its branches, particularly in the Tantric Way of ¯ Mantras (Mantranaya),155 which if not entirely the product of this region was very largely so; and this immense creativity, whose products formed in due course the basis of the Buddhism of Inner Asia, was nurtured and refined in a num ber of major monasteries, of which the most eminent were those of Naland ā, ¯ Vikramas´īla, Somapura, Trikat.uka, Uddaṇ ḍ apura, and Jagaddala.156 That the

156 The Naland āmah āvih āra was located in Bihar about 55 miles southeast of Patna, ¯ with the Uddaṇ ḍ apuramahavih āra close by. The Vikrama ¯ s´īlamahavih āra was very ¯ probably at Antichak in the Bhagalpur District of Bihar about 19 miles from ¯ Bhagalpur towṇ No evidence conclusively etablishes thiṣBut the huge size of the ¯ monastery excavated at Antichak severely narrows the field of known possibilities; and there is suggestive archaeological evidence: a copper seal was uncovered in the ruins of the monastery with the legend vikramasya (IAR, 1973–4, p. 9) and a dam aged inscription on a Stupa there contains the syllables ¯ vikrama. . . (HUNTINGTON 1984, pp. 125–126). The use of Vikrama for Vikramas´īla is seen in Anupamavajra’s Adikarmapradīpa ¯; see here p. 91. That the name of the monastery was Vikrama s´īla rather than Vikramasil ´ a, as it appears in some secondary sources, is clear from, ¯ e.g., the scribal colophon of a manuscript of Vajragarbha’s Hevajratantrapiṇ ḍārtha t.īkā that was penned there: śrīmadvikramaśīlamahāvihāre lekhāpitaṁ. The Soma puramahavih āra was at P āhār¯ .pur about 29 miles northwest of Mahasth ān (ancient ¯ Puṇ ḍravardhana) in Varendrī, the region of northern Bengal between the arms of the Ganges and Karatoya rivers ( ¯ Rāmacarita 3.10ab: apy abhito gaṅgākaratoyā narghapravāhapuṇ yatamāṁ The Jagaddalamahavih āra too was in this region; ¯ see Rāmacarita 3.7: . . . jagaddalamahāvihāracitarāgām | dadhatīm lokeśam api mahattārodīritorumahimānam ‘[the land (of Varendrī)], whose beauty was height ened by the Jagaddalamahavih āra, which was home to Loke ¯ svara, its extensive ´ glory proclaimed by [a] great [image of] Tarā’. Its site has beeen tentatively iden- ¯ tified as the mound at modern Jagdal in the Dhamoirhat Upazila of the Naogaon District of the Rajshahi Division of Bangladesḥ A one-season, small-scale exca vation of this mound was undertaken by Bangladesh’s Department of Archaeology in the winter of 1996. Though it revealed evidence of the presence of a Buddhist monastery and unearthed a fine statue of Heruka and his consort, most of the site was left untouched and nothing has been reported that raises to certainty the high probability that this was the Jagaddalamahavih āra. See Z ¯ AKARIA 1994 and MIAH 1997/8. The location of the Trikat.ukavihara is as yet unknown, but T āran ātha re- ¯ lates a myth that on instructions from Mahakāla king Devap āla unearthed this ¯ monastery beneath a sand dune when he was crossing Rarā (=R ād¯ .ha) ( ¯ HBI, p. 267; MAJUMDAR 1971, p. 525), the region of Bengal south of Varendrī and west of the Bhagīrathī river, divided into Uttararad¯ .ha, covering part of Birbhum District and ¯

Palas’ devotion to the Buddha was expressed, as we might expect, in the creation ānd support of these great monastic universities is shown by terracotta seals found amid their remains, and by the Rgya gar chos ’byung (‘The Arising of the Dharma in India’), a Tibetan account of the history of Indian Buddhism written in 1608. 

Taran ātha, the author of this work, tells us that he wrote it on the basis ¯ of three Sanskrit sources that are now lost or inaccessible. The first is an un named work in 2,000 verses by a scholar of Magadha named Sa dbang bzang po, that is to say, Kṣmendrabhadra or a synonym such as Dharaṇīndrabhadra. This covered the history of the religion up to the time of the Pala king R āmap āla ¯ (r̥ c. 1072–1126). The second is the Buddhapurāṇ a, a work by Dbang pos sbyin (Indradatta) in 1,200 verses, which went beyond Ramap āla to cover the succes- ¯ sor dynasty of the Senas of Gauḍ a. It may therefore be supposed to have been composed in that part of India, like the work of Kṣmendrabhadra. The third is a work of similar length covering the succession of Acāryas and written by a ¯ 

brahmin scholar whom Taran ātha calls Bhat ¯ .aghat ¯ .ī. This name is implausible as it standṣIf, as is probable, it is is deformation of Vandyaghat.īya, then it identifies him as a member of a well-known Rad¯ .hīya brahmin lineage of Ben gal (> Bandyopadhy āya, Banerjee). ¯157 Taran ātha claims to have relied primar- ¯ ily on the first of these three works, that is to say, for his account up to the time of Ramap āla, since that source went no further̥ ¯158 For the period of the Senas, who succeeded the Palas, he must have relied on Indradatta alone. As for ¯ Vandyaghat.īya’s account of the succession of Acāryas, it is probable that it con- ¯ sisted of, or extended to, an account of the succession of the Tantric Acāryas of ¯ 

Vikramas´īla from its foundation in the eighth century to its destruction around 

1200 by the forces of Muḥ ammad Bakh ¯ tyar Kh āljī. For he adds a section in the manner of a supplement on the Acāryas of Vikrama ¯ s´īla after his treatment of 

the periods covered by his first two sourceṣHis work, then, derives from Indian tradition, and while his sources were evidently inaccurate for the early history of Buddhism, we might expect them, particularly the work of Kṣmendrabhadra, 

the whole of Burdwan District, and Dakṣiṇ arad¯ .ha, covering Bankura District and ¯ the non-coastal part of Midnapur District. 

157 In the eulogy of Bhat.t.a Bhavadeva, the learned minister of Harivarman (c. 1090+), in a stone inscription from Bhubaneswar, Bhavadeva’s mother Sangok ˙ a is said to be ¯ the daughter of a Vandyaghat.īya brahmin (EI 6:17B, v. 13). Other Vandyaghat.īyas are the Sarvananda who in 1159 wrote a commentary ¯ T.īkāsarvasva on the Liṅgānuśāsana of Amarasiṁ ha, the great 16th-century Dharmas´astrin Raghunan- ¯ dana, author of the Smr̥titattva (PINGREE 1994, p. 341), Narāyan ¯ . a (fl. c. 1681), author of the Smr̥tisarvasva or Smr̥titattva (PINGREE 1994, p. 181), and Dvija Lakṣmaṇ a, who translated the Adikān ¯. ḍ a of the Adhyātmarāmāyaṇ a into Bengali. 158 Rgya gar chos ’byung, pp. 215, l. 22–214, l.10; HBI, p. 350.

to be more reliable in their account of what for them was recent history.159 The Rgya gar chos ’byung therefore deserves close attentioṇ 

Taran ātha attributes to Dharmap āla the building of the monastery of ¯ Vikramas´īla and to Devapala the building of the monasteries of Somapura and ¯ Trikat.uka.160 In this, however, he or his sources are confuseḍ The claim that the monastery at Somapura was founded by Devapala is contradicted by a terracotta ¯ seal found at the site bearing the legend śrīsomapure śrīdharmmapāladeva mahāvihāre ‘in the Mahavih āra of Dharmap āladeva at Somapura’, ¯161 thereby indicating that it was founded not by Devapala but by his father Dharmap āla. ¯ Evidence also contradicts Taran ātha’s claim that it was Devap āla that built the ¯ Trikat.uka monastery. For Haribhadra reports at the end of his Abhisamayā laṁ kārāloka, his great commentary on the Aṣt.asāhasrikā Praj ñāpāramitā, that he composed it in this monastery during the reign of Dharmapala and under his ¯ patronage.162

In the case of the Somapura monastery it has been argued that we may salvage Taran ātha’s credibility by concluding that Devap āla did found this ¯ monastery, as Taran ātha claims, and that he gave it his father’s name rather ¯ than his own out of filial piety.163 This is indeed a practice of which there are other examples, its purpose being to transfer to the person named the religious merit generated by the creation and use of the foundation; but it is much more probable that Taran ātha is in error here, as he clearly is in the case of the ¯ Trikat.uka monastery. For his history commits the fundamental error of revers ing the true sequence of the two reigns, placing that of Devapala before that of ¯ Dharmapala. ¯164 His attribution of the founding of Somapura and Trikat.uka to Devapala rather than Dharmap āla can, then, readily be explained as the result ¯ of this reversal. We may therefore suspect that his attribution of the founding of Vikramas´īla to Dharmapala suffers from the same dislocation and that its ¯ true founder was his son Devapala. That this suspicion is correct is confirmed ¯ by the Adikarmapradīpa ¯ of Anupamavajra. For in its conclusion he tells us that he compiled the work following the instruction of Dharmakara, a monk ¯ whom he describes as “residing in the monastery called Vikrama constructed by king Devapala”. ¯165 Vikrama here is evidently a bhīmavat contraction for Vikramas´īla.166 However, we may not conclude that everything that Taran ātha āttributes to Dharmapala was Devap āla’s doing, and ¯ vice versa. He reports, for 

of the swollen globes on the foreheads of the furious elephants [of his enemies], has attained his glorious success by virtue of the dedication produced by his repeated pious works’.

probability that this report is accurate is increased by the fact that he, unlike Taran ātha, knew that Dharmap āla came before not after Devap āla.

Taran ātha reports that Dharmap āla adopted two persons as his preceptors: ¯ Haribhadra and his pupil Buddhajn˜ana. While the former was a master of the ¯ Praj ñāpāramitā, the latter was a renowned authority on the Tantric system taught in the Guhyasamāja.171 We are told that he performed the rituals for the consecration of the Vikramas´īla monastery and was appointed as its Vajracārya. ¯ We also learn that, having seen omens of the future ruin of the dynasty un der Dharmapala’s grandson, he persuaded the king to institute a regular fire- ¯ sacrifice (homaḥ) to be performed under his guidance by the Tantric officiants of this monastery with the purpose of ensuring that the dynasty would be long lived and consequently that Buddhism would be widely disseminateḍ It was performed, we are told, for many years at huge expense.172 Further evidence of 

it appears that it began as a small Sangh ˙ arāma donated by the fourth Gupta king, ¯ Kumaragupta ¯ Sakr ´ aditya, who reigned from 415 to 455.

Dharmapala’s commitment to Buddhism is found in the Nesarik ā grant of the ¯ Ras¯ .t.rakut¯ .a king Govinda III issued in 805, since that reveals that the ensign depicted on his war banner was the Buddhist goddess Tarā. ¯173 

As for Gopala (r̥ ¯ c. 750–775), the father of Dharmapala, whom all our sources ¯ make the first of the Palas, there is no evidence in the inscriptions that he ¯ too was a Buddhist, unless it be his having been referred to in inscriptions of Narāyan ¯ . apala (r̥ ¯ c. 860–917) and Vigrahapala III (r̥ ¯ c. 1043–1070) as a second Buddha.174 However, the Rājavyākaraṇ a claims him for the faith, saying that af ter a dissolute youth he converted to Buddhism and constructed various monas teries, Caityas, and templeṣ175 Taran ātha likewise claims that he served the ¯ cause of Buddhism by founding many monasteries, both in Bengal, which he ruled in the first part of his career, and Magadha, when he had added that great province to his kingdom through conquest.176 He also recounts a legend accord

In his account of Buddhism under the successors of Gopala, Dharmap āla, ānd Devapala, T āran ātha gives us one more report of royal monastery building. ¯ But unfortunately his sources seem to have been so misinformed in their pre sentation of the order and identity of these subsequent kings that it is no easy task to discern the reign to which this building activity should be assigneḍ He tells us that Mahapāla, whom he claims to have been the son and successor of ¯ Mahīpala, built the Uruv āsa monastery, described as a branch of the monastery āt Uddaṇ ḍ apura, and founded Buddhist establishments at the monasteries of Naland ā, Somapura, and Trikat ¯ .uka.179 Taran ātha has his Mah ¯īpala rule for ¯ 

first part of his life he governed Vang˙ ala. In the subsequent part he subjected Ma- ¯ gadha. Near Uddaṇ ḍ apura he built a monastery called Nalendra. By establishing ¯ many divisions of the Sangha [in monasteries] in these two large regions he greatly ˙ honoured the religion [of the Buddha]; HBI, p. 258.

Now, there are two Mahīpalas known to ¯ us from the epigraphical record, both of whom were much later, the first ruling c. 977–1027 and the second c. 1070–1071; but there is no Mahapāla. The similar- ¯ ity with the name of his father raises the suspicion that one king Mahīpala, no ¯ doubt Mahīpala I, the length of his reign agreeing closely with that attributed to ¯ Mahīpala by T āran ātha, has become Mah ¯īpala and Mah āpāla, and that the re- ¯ sulting two reigns, amounting implausibly to ninety-three years, served to bridge a gulf of ignorance of the period between the great founders of the Pala empire ānd Mahīpala I, who restored the fortunes of the P ālas after a period during ¯ which, following Devapala, they had lapsed into insignificance, losing control of ¯ Bengal and retreating into a core territory in Bihar around modern Patna.182 It is probable, then, that Taran ātha’s attribution to Mah āpāla of the expansion of ¯ Uddaṇ ḍ apura and the founding of Buddhist establishments at Naland ā, Soma- ¯ pura, and Trikat.uka is a distortion of a record of the pious works of Mahīpala I. ¯ The supposition is somewhat strengthened by the fact that Taran ātha says that ¯ the Kālacakratantra was introduced during the latter half of Mahīpala’s life and ¯ that it spread during the reign of Mahapāla. ¯183 For it was during the reign of Mahīpala I that this new Tantric system emergeḍ ¯184

After Mahīpala the monastic universities already established continued to ¯ flourish, but Pala fortunes once again went into decline, and it is therefore not ¯ surprising that Taran ātha has no major royal benefactions to report during this ¯ perioḍ However, during the long reign of Ramap āla (r̥ ¯ c. 1072–1126), the last major ruler of this dynasty, the kingdom recovered, and we might expect this to be reflected in a renewal of material patronage. It is tempting therefore to accept the claim made by Hara Prasad SHASTRI in 1910185 and repeated by many since that time186 that the Jagaddalamahavih āra, ¯187 the one great monastery in the Pala domains whose founder has not yet been identified, was the creation of this ¯ monarcḥ But there is no evidence that supports this claim188 

Nor is there any that refutes it. In the introduction to the edition of the Subhāṣitaratnakoṣa published by KOSAMBI and GOKHALE the former has asserted on the strength of evidence provided by the latter that Ramap āla’s ¯ coronation took place in this monastery,189 in which case, of course, it could not have been founded by him during his reigṇ But that too cannot be accepteḍ The evidence cited is GOKHALE’s rendering of the colophonic verse at the end of the *Bhagavatyāmnyāyānusāriṇī vyākhyā, a commentary on the Aṣt.asāhasrikā Praj ñāpāramitā which survives in Tibetan translation (Toḥ 3811): ¯190 “This vyākhyā was composed by Raja-jagaddala-niv ās¯ī [which thus becomes the writer’s name] at the Jagaddala vihara, which was the place of R āmap āla’s ¯ coronation”.191 But this rendering is wildly inaccurate. The meaning of the Tibetan is: “I, a resident of the venerable Rajajagaddala [monastery], have ¯ composed this commentary, a string of pearls (muktāvalī) [to be an adornment] of the land protected by King Ramap āla”. ¯192 This does at least convey the

valuable information that the monastery was a royal foundation, since the Tibetan of its name dpal ldan rgyal po dza ga ta la, is evidently a translation of śrīmadraja ¯ jagaddala-, a form of the name confirmed by its occurrence in Sanskrit at the end of Mokṣakaragupta’s ¯ Tarkabhāsā, in which he informs us that he too was a resident of this monastery (śrīmadrājajagaddalavihārīya-).193 But we remain ignorant of the king who founded it. We know that it existed in the time of Ramap āla, and it is not impossible that it was indeed the work of this ¯ last great king of the dynasty; but no evidence of which I am aware precludes its having been created by a predecessor̥ 

Some idea of the scale of the Great Monasteries in the Pala domains is pro- ¯ vided by Taran ātha. He informs us that in the reign of R āmap āla, even after ¯ the decline from the time of the early Palas, there were one hundred and sixty ¯ monks holding posts as Paṇ ḍitas at Vikramas´īla, and that there were about a thousand monks permanently in residence, both there and at Uddaṇ ḍ apura, with many more assembling on the occasion of festivalṣ194 We also learn that when Vikramas´īla was founded its design incorporated one hundred and eight shrines: a central temple housing a life-size statue of the Great Awakening (Mahabodhi) ¯195 surrounded by fifty-three small temples dedicated to the inner 

precedes—mi yi dbang po ‘king’, lit. ‘lord of men’, rendering Sanskrit nr̥ patiḥ, narendraḥ, or a synonym—, the fact that rā ma pā las after it is instrumental not genitive, and the fact that the emphatic and separative particle ni that ends the larger phrase of which this is part and marks it out as the subject militates against its being taken as qualifying the monastery. The expression mu tig phreng ba describing the commentary figuratively as a string of pearls is probably also in tended to convey its title by paronomasia, i.e. Muktāvalī, a title found elsewhere in this literature, for example as the title of Ratnakara ¯ s´anti’s commentary on the ¯ Hevajratantra. The author remains anonymouṣ

These royal monasteries are likely to have accumulated great wealtḥ The tax-exempt agricultural lands granted to them at the time of their foundation would have provided them with a substantial initial endowment: Huili reports that Naland ā’s was the revenue of about 100 villages; ¯202 and the wealth from this source would no doubt have been augmented by subsequent land-grants203 and would certainly have been augmented by other votive donations, bequests from the estates of deceased laymen,204 and the profits of such non-religious activities as banking and the provision of irrigation and other agricultural facilitieṣ205 

No doubt they would also have benefitted from the riches accumulated by individual monks in the form of the rewards (dakṣiṇā) that they earned by giving initiations, imparting instruction, installing images, consecrating monasteries and temples, reciting sacred texts, and performing rites for protection, funeral ceremonies, and the like.206 Tibetan sources record the very large amounts of gold which Indian and Tibetans required for such serviceṣ’Brog mi agreed to give the Indian Gayadhara 100 gold srang, some 3,750 grams, each year for five years in return for the transmission of the esoteric Lam ’bras teachings;207 Zur po che sha kya ’byung nas offered ’Brog mi 100; ¯208 Rva lo tsa ba gave 100 ¯ srang to the Nepalese Guru Bha ro phyag rdum for the Yamāri cycle instructions; Se

203 We have a record (EI 17:17: the Naland ā copper-plate of Devap āla) of one such sub- ¯ sequent land-grant in the case of the monastery at Naland ā. This records that in ¯ the 35th year of Devapala, ¯ c. 847, five villages were assigned for the support of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha of a new monastery ( ˙ vihāraḥ) constructed at this site by Maharāja B ālaputradeva, the ¯ Sailendra king of Suvarn ´. advīpa (Suma tra). That the regnal year is the 35th is the view of SIRCAR (1983, p. 79, note 38). Hirananda SHASTRI read the numerals as 39 (EI 17:17, l. 42). 

204 The M ¯ulasarvāstivādavinaya speaks of the validity of written wills in which wealthy laymen transfer their entire estate to the the Sangha; see ˙ Gilgit Manuscripts vol. 3, pt. 2, p. 140, l. 14–15, l. 1; and SCHOPEN 2004, p. 6.

It would be rash to assume that the fortunes that were garnered in this way by Indian Acāryas were added directly to the resources of their monasterieṣ¯ A passage in the Mahāvairocanābhisaṁ bodhitantra, a text produced in the sev enth century, at the beginning of the history of the Mantranaya as a fully-fledged path within the Mahayāna, ¯211 suggests that this was the case:212 

After the [śāntika]homaḥthe Mantrin should request from the disciples a fee (dakṣiṇā) of gold, silver, jewels, a stallion, an elephant, a mare, a cow, a bull, a buffalo, cloth, and whatever else is fitting. At that time the disciples should give the dakṣiṇā to the Guru, respectfully, with faith, generating joy in their mindṣOr at any rate they should make the Guru entirely satisfieḍ After [the Mantrin, that is to say, the Guru] has done this he should do a rite of self-protection and then exhort the excellent disciples as follows: All the Buddhas teach that this is a field for [the sowing of] merit for the benefit of all living beingṣTherefore give to the Sangha, [for it is] vast in its pure virtueṣ˙ 

But it is striking that references to the Sangha are not found in this context in ˙ later texts, which only specify the goods that should be giveṇThese are much the same as in the Mahāvairocanābhisaṁ bodhi, though Dīpankarabhadra, setting ˙ out the procedure for initiation with the Maṇ ḍ ala of the Guhyasamāja, adds land

at the head of the list,213 and the scripture Laghuśaṁ varatantra goes so far as in clude a rāṣt.ram, which I take to mean [the revenues of] ‘a district’ or ‘sub-district’ of a kingdom and therefore to be envisaging the gift of a monarcḥ214 Moreover, the M ¯ulasarvāstivādavinaya, which was the predominant code of monastic law in eastern India and was thence adopted in Tibet, recognizes that monks had private property and that there could be great differences of wealth owned by individuals within the Sangha. However, it also insists that such property does ˙ not go to the king when a monk dies, as brahmanical law required in the case of those who die without offspring, but remains within the monastic community to which he belongṣ215 Of course, a wealthy Guru could also donate his wealth to 

213 Guhyasamājamaṇ ḍ alavidhi, f. 16v1–2, v. 375c: bh ¯ugajādisuvarṇādau ‘land, an elephant or [other mount], gold, and other [valuables]’. The Mr̥tasugati niyojana of S´unyasam ādhivajra includes houses, land, and male and female ¯ slaves among the gifts that should be given to an officiant who performs the Tantric funerary ceremony (antyeṣt.iḥ): yojanako ’pi svavibhavānur ¯upaṁ vastrālaṁ kāraśayanāsanagr̥hakṣetradāsīdāsādikaṁ dakṣiṇāmācāryāya sādaraṁ dadyāt (f. 4r2–3). 

214 Laghuśaṁ vara f. 4r1–3 (3.11–14b): tatas tu gurave dadyāt tathāgatoktadakṣiṇām | nirjātyaṁsuvarṇ aśatasahasraṁratnāni vividhāni ca k 3.12 vastrayugmaśataṁ caiva gaja vājī rāṣt.ram eva ca | karṇābharaṇ a kat.akaṁca kaṇt.hikāṅgulikaiś ca samuttamam k 3.13 yaj ñopavīta sauvarṇ aṁsvabhāryāṁ duhitām api | dāsa dāsī bhagnīṁ vāpi praṇipatya nivedayet ‘Then he should give to the Guru the dakṣiṇā prescribed by the Tathagata. After prostrating himself he should give 100,000 ¯ [Palas] of the most precious gold, jewels of various kinds, 200 lengths of cloth, an elephant, a horse, and a rāṣt.ram, earrings, bracelets, necklaces, rings, and a crown, a golden caste-thread, his wife, his daughter, a male slave, a female slave, or his sister’. The use of the term rāṣt.ram for ‘a district’ or ‘sub-district’ is seen in in scriptions; see SIRCAR 1966, pp. 277–278. My translation of the passage follows the text and interpretation of the commentator Bhavabhat.t.a. The reading nirjātyaṁ, which he interprets as ‘most precious’, is suspect. The MS (Laghuśaṁ vara, f. 4r2) reads the much more satisfactory niryātya ‘having given’, as does the com mentator Kambalapada ( ¯ Sādhananidhi, f. 11v4); and this is also the reading seen in f. 54v3–5 of the Saṁ varodayā nāma maṇ ḍ alopāyikā of Bhuvācārya of Ratna- ¯ giri in Orissa (see here p. 91), in the Nepalese codex unicus of 1056. See also Catuṣpīt.hatantra f. 60v1–2 (4.1.46–47), which includes a house, land with rights to mine, and grain: tato gurudakṣinaṁ dadyā śiṣya bhāvena nityaśaḥ|ātmapatnīṁ saputraṁ vā bāndhavaiḥsaha cet.ikaiḥ| hasti aśva gavādīnāṁ gr̥ ha kṣetras ca go- ´ travan¯ k sauvarṇ a rajata tāmraṁ vastrādi vrıhidh ānyakaih ¯.. The Vimalaprabhā on Kālacakratantra, Abhiṣekapat.ala v. 198 explains that verse as meaning that the initiate should promise always to give to his Guru one sixth of all his inherited and self-acquired wealth in the form of gold, jewels, grains and the like, and a sixth of all his livestock. It adds that he is required to give his wife to the Guru five times each month (vol. 2, p. 144, ll. 17–22). 

215 The inheritance of the property of deceased monks is treated in the M ¯ulasarvāsti vādavinaya in the Cīvaravastu (Gilgit Manuscripts vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 113–148). Par ticularly relevant in this context is its discussion of the case of the monk Upananda, who died leaving 300,000 in gold (pp. 117–121). King Prasenajit is persuaded that the estate does not belong to the crown and the Buddha rules that it should be

the monasteries during his lifetime by creating religious endowmentṣWe have a striking example of this in the eleventh century. Rva Lo tsa ba, who had be- ¯ come extremely wealthy by charging for instruction in the Tantras—he is said to have established fixed rates for a wide range of texts—, sent 100 srangs of gold to Vikramas´īla to fund the recitation in perpetuity of a copy of the Pa ñca viṁśatisāhasrikā Praj ñāpāramitā written in gold, two golden copies of the Aṣt.a sāhasrikā Praj ñāpāramitā, and 100 srangs of gold to fund the recitation in per petuity of eighty-four copies of the Praj ñāpāramitāsaṁcayagāthā by eighty-four Paṇ ḍitas of the monastery.216 

How closely the Pala emperors and their bureaucracy were involved in the ¯ supervision of their Buddhist foundations cannot be determined from the avail able evidence. But it is almost certain that a Superintendent would have been appointed by the ruler to oversee their administration and that he would have required a substantial staff to enable him to do so. The Ratnāvalī, a Mahayānist ¯ work of uncertain authorship written before the sixth century,217 advises the un known king to whom it is addressed on the proper administration of his realm 

distributed among the monks of his monastery: bhājayata y ¯uyaṁ bhikṣava upa nandasya bhikṣor mr̥tapariṣkāram (p. 119, ll. 13–14). The main concern here is to ensure that the wealth of monks stays within the community, free of the state’s interferecee. For analysis of the treatment of these and related matters in the M ¯ulasarvāstivāda-vinaya see SCHOPEN 2004, pp. 3–6. The private property of a deceased monk was to be divided, directly or after sale, among the members of his community or, where this was not appropriate, as in the case of land, servants, and grain-stores, taken over for the use of the whole community (Gilgit Manuscripts, vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 141, l. 4–143, l. 1). But when the estate contained precious metals, worked or not, those were to be divided into three shares, one for each of the Three Jewels (Gilgit Manuscripts, vol. 3, pt. 2, p. 143, ll. 10–12: suvarnaṁca hiraṇ yaṁ ca yac cānyac ca kr̥tākr̥taṁtrayo bhāgāḥ kartavyāḥ| eko buddhasya | eko dhar masya tr̥tīyaḥsaṅghasya). That for the Buddha should be used for repairs to the monastery’s Buddha shrine (gandhakut.ī) and relic Stupas, that for the Dharma ¯ should fund the copying or enthroning of the Buddha’s teachings, and that for the Sangha should be divided among the monks ( ˙ ibiḍ, ll. 12–14). In the case of jewels other than pearls half should go to the Dharma and half to the Sangha ( ˙ ibiḍ, ll. 1– 5). Manuscripts of Buddhist texts should be added to the monastery’s library and manuscripts of non-Buddhist texts should be sold and the proceeds shared (ibiḍ, ll. 5–7).

217 The work is attributed to the Nagārjuna of ¯ M ¯ulāmadhyamakakārikā fame. I con sider this attribution to be doubtful in spite the fact that it is made by such au thors of the sixth century and later as Bhavaviveka, Candrak ¯īrti, Haribhadra, Ka malas´īla, and *Ajitamitra (Mi pham bshes gnyen), who wrote the only known com mentary on the text, which has come down to us in a Tibetan translation made by the Bande Dpal brtsegs with the Indian Vidyakaraprabha in the early ninth cen- ¯ tury. The Ratnāvalī itself contains no evidence of its authorship and VETTER (1992) has cast doubt on the traditional attribution through an analysis of its metre and word frequency.

and begins by declaring: “Appoint for all religious foundations a Superinten dent of Religion (dharmādhikr̥taḥ) who is energetic, without avarice, learned, and virtuous, who will not oppress them”.218 It goes on to advise him on the qualities he should look for in those whom he appoints as ministers (sacivāḥ), military commanders (daṇ ḍ anāyakāḥ), and superintendents (adhikr̥tāḥ), telling the king: “Have them submit to you complete monthly accounts of revenues and outgoings and, after hearing these, personally conduct all business pertaining to religious foundations and the rest”.219 This, of course, is not evidence of what was done in the Pala realṁ But as I read the passage it is the qualities and ¯ duties of these various officials that are the subject of injunction, not their exis tence; and there is certainly nothing exceptional in the office itself, since we have evidence that it was normal in kingdoms throughout the Indic worlḍ220 Ab 

218 Ratnāvalī 4.22: sarvadharmādhikāreṣu dharmādhikr̥tam utthitam | alubdhaṁ paṇ ḍitaṁ dharmyaṁ kuru teṣām abādhakaṁ The term dharmādhikāraḥ, which elsewhere is used to refer to the office of the Superintendent, is clearly used here in the meaning ‘religious foundation’, as the Tibetan translation chos kyi gzhi agrees, and as it occurrence earlier in the same passage (4.18) confirms: dharmādhikārā ye cānye p ¯urvarājapravartitāḥ| devadroṇ yādayas te ’pi pravartyantāṁ yathā sthitāḥ ‘And you should ensure that temples and other religious foundations created by former kings should continue as they are’. This sense of the word is also found in Licchavi inscriptions; see LKA 71, ll. 12; and 81, l. 11–12: bhaviṣyadbhir api bh ¯upatibhiḥ p ¯urvarājakr̥tadharmādhikārapālanādr̥tair bhavitavyam ‘Future kings too must take care to maintain religious foundations created by kings of the past’.

220 In the Abhij ñānaśākuntala of Kalid āsa Dus ¯ .yanta, wishing to conceal his identity from Sakuntal ´ a tells us that he has been appointed by the king to the office of Su- ¯ perintendent of Religion and accordingly has come to her hermitage in his official capacity to satisfy himself that they are free of hindrances to the performance of their rites; Act 1, after v. 22, p. 38: bhavati yaḥ pauraveṇ a rāj ñā dharmādhikāre niyuktaḥso ’ham avighnakriyopalambhāya dharmāraṇ yamāyātaḥ. The fifth Da-¯ modarpur copper-plate inscription, of 533/4, recording a formal request for the pur chase of land in the Kot.ivarṣa district to be given to a nearby temple, speaks of it being presented with the full knowledge of the Office of Religion (dharmādhikāra buddhyā) (EI 15:7, p. 143). A banker Ralhaṇ a has the title dharmakarmādhikārī ‘the superintendent of religious activities’ in the Kharod inscription dated in 1181/2 of Ratnadeva III, the Kalacuri of Ratnapura (EI 21:26, l. 28: śreṣt.hinā ralhaṇe nātra dharmakarmādhikāriṇā). The humourous play Agamad ¯. ambara, composed by the Kashmirian philosopher Jayantabhat.t.a and set in the Kashmir of his own time, during the reign of Sa´ nkaravarman (883–902), has a ˙ Saiva ascetic inform us ´ that a brahmin Saṁ karṣaṇ a has been appointed by that king to the dharmarakṣā dhikāraḥ, the ‘Office of Superintendent of Religion’ for the whole country (Act 3, Prelude, p. 132: śakalāe yyeva vaśuṁ dhalāe dhammalaṣkādhiāle ṇiutte [*sakalāyā eva vasuṁ dharāyā dharmarakṣādhikāre niyuktaḥ]).

sence of thorough external control of the great monasteries seems all the more unlikely when one considers that apart from the fact that they were such large and wealthy establishments it was not the case that by building, equipping, and endowing a monastery a patron surrendered his ownership entirely. The patron continued to be the owner of the monastery and its contents (mahāvihārasvāmī, vihārasvāmī) in some sense and the monks were obliged to employ all these for the purposes for which they were designated, the return for the owner being the constantly augmenting merit that was generated for him by their repeated use (paribhogānvayaṁ puṇ yam). Only where there was no such use, as in the case of a Caitya, did a donor gain merit once and for all by the simple act of surrendering ownership (tyāgānvyayaṁ puṇ yam).221 

Moreover, we know that monks who held senior teaching positions in the great monasteries did so by royal appointment,222 and that rituals for state pro 

of Kamākhy ā, near Gauhati in Assam, recording a grant of land by a king M ādhava. ¯ The inscription opens with the information that the grant has the approval of this official: dharmādhikr̥tenānumatam (SIRCAR 1979, p. 16, l. 1). Mpu Prapanca re- ˜ veals in his Old Javanese poem Deśawarṇ ana that there were two Superintendents of Religion in the Majapahit kingdom of east Java, one for the Buddhists (dharmā dhyakṣa kasogatan), and the other for the Saivas ( ´ dharmādhyakṣa kashaiwan). Inscriptions from that kingdom reveal that there was also a board of subordinate religious officials known as the Assessors of Religion (dharmopapatti or dharmādhi karaṇ a); see SANTIKO 1995, p. 56; cf. here p.119; for references see ZOETMULDER 1982, under dharmādhyakṣa, dharmopapatti and dharmādhikaraṇ a. 

221 On this crucial distinction between paribhogānvayaṁ puṇ yam and tyāgānvayaṁ puṇ yam see Vasubandhu, Abhidharmakośabhāṣya on 4.121a (caitye tyāgānvayaṁ puṇ yam ‘In the case of a Caitya there is merit that accrues from surrender’): caitye sarāgasyātmārthaṁ dānam ity uktam | tatrāsaty upabhoktari kathaṁ puṇ yaṁ bha vati | dvividhaṁ puṇ yaṁtyāgānvayaṁtyāgād eva yad utpadyate paribhogānvayaṁ ca deyadharmaparibhogād yad utpadyate | caitye tyagānvayam ¯. puṇyam (4.121a) ‘It has been said that a gift to a Caitya made by one who is not free of attachment is for his own benefit. Since there is no enjoyer of the gift in such cases how can there be merit [generated by such a gift]? Merit is of two kinds: tyāgānvayam, which arises only from the surrender [of ownership of what is given], and parib hogānvayam, which arises from the enjoyment of a pious gift [by the recipients]’. One should note that the restrictive particle eva is used here only after tyāgāḍ Va subandhu does not state conversely in the case of paribhogānvayaṁ puṇ yam that this kind of merit arises only (eva) from the use of the donatioṇ I infer that merit in such cases was understood to arise both from the act of surrendering possession and from subsequent use. This is confirmed by Candrakīrti, who in his Prasanna padā, commenting on paribhogānvayam in Madhyamakakārikā 17.5a, speaks of the goods used as ‘surrendered’ (parityaktasya). See Abhidharmakośabhāṣya on 4.4ab addressing the conundrum of how the Buddha’s doctrine of moral action as intention (cetanā) can be reconciled with this claim of the accretion of further merit (puṇ yavr̥ddhiḥ) whenever a recipient uses something donated whether or not the donor is aware of it; and SANDERSON 1995c, pp. 38–40.

King Bheyapala (Abhayap āla?), a king otherwise unknown, whom T āran ātha ¯ makes the predecessor of Neyapala (Nayap āla [r̥ ¯ c. 1027-1043], the successor of Mahīpala I), is reported to have bestowed charters of appointment on only sev- ¯ enty Paṇ ḍitas of Vikramas´īla (Rgya gar chos ’byung, p. 184, ll. 14: bi kra ma shī lar ni | pa ṇ ḍi ta bdun cu tsam gyi *pa tra (corr̥ : sa tra Eḍ) las ma tshugs te; HBI, p. 304) Taran ātha tells us that for that reason he is not counted among ¯ the Seven Palas (p. 184, ll. 14–15, ¯ HBI, p. 304), that is to say the seven remem bered for their exceptional patronage of the faitḥ These seven are not listed, but Taran ātha does say which of the P ālas were excluded from the list.

The Pālas’ Engagement with Saivism ´ 

The Palas were certainly the most liberal patrons of Buddhist institutions ¯ in early medieval India, and it was no doubt largely because of this that the religion was able to develop and flourish so remarkably in their realṁ However, it should not be thought that the scale of these rulers’ support implies that they at least, unlike the other royal patrons of Buddhism that have been reviewed here, must have turned their backs on Saivism, starving it of patronage that it ´ might otherwise have receiveḍ For there is much evidence to the contrary. 

In the ninth century Devapala is praised in a charter of his son Mahen- ¯ drapala for having built two temples of outstanding beauty during his rule, ¯ one for the Buddha and the other for the consort of Siva; ´ 226 and Mahen drapala is reported to have established a temple for the emaciated goddess ¯ Carca (Carcik ā/Cāmun ¯ . ḍ a). ¯227 An eleventh-century Prasasti from B ´ an¯ . garh, ancient Kot.ivarṣa in Varendrī, also called Devīkot.a and Son ´.itapura, informs us that Nayapala had the Saiddh āntika Sarva ¯ siva as his royal preceptor ´ 

(gauḍ arājaguruḥ), and that when Sarvasiva retired he passed this office to ´ his brother Murti ¯ siva. This implies that Nayap ´ ala received ¯ Saiva initiation, ´ since to initiate the king is fundamental to the Saiva R ´ ajaguru’s role. It also ¯ tells us that at the site of this inscription Mahīpala I, Nayap āla’s predecessor, ¯ had bestowed a Kailasa-like monastery on Sarva ¯ siva’s predecessor Indra ´ siva. ´ Mahīpala is described here as a ‘knower of reality’ ( ¯ tattvavit), which suggests in this Saiva context that he too had received ´ Saiva initiation, which suggests ´ in turn that the gift of the monastery was his Guru’s dakṣiṇā.

that this tradition was still in place under his successor Ramap āla. For in the ¯ twelfth century the South-Indian Saiddhantika Trilocanasiva tells us that his ´ preceptorial line descends from a Dharmasambhu (Dharma ´ siva) who had held ´ office as the royal preceptor of “the king of Gauḍ a”, a standard expression for the Pala rulers. ¯230 Since three preceptorial generations intervene in that account between Dharmasambhu and Trilocana ´ siva, it is probable that this king was ´ Ramap āla. ¯231

Similarly, the Bhagalpur copper-plate inscription of N ārāyan ¯ . apala (r̥ ¯ c. 860– 917) records his establishing a Siva and granting a village to it and the associ- ´ 

ation of Pa¯supat ´ acāryas ( ¯ pāśupatācāryapariṣat.) attached to the foundation; and though it gives him the epithet paramasaugataḥit reports that he had been re sponsible for the building of a vast number of other temples for this deity.234 

We have even more striking evidence of this kind in the case of Nayapala. ¯ His Siyan stone slab inscription ( ¯ EI 39:7) devotes most of its sixty-five verses (21–63) to detailing an extensive program of royal temple building and image installation undertaken throughout the Pala realṁ Damage to the inscription ¯ has removed the name of the king who was responsible for this program, but it is extremely unlikely that it was other than Nayapala, since the account follows ¯ immediately on that of his martial exploits, following those of his predecessorṣThese pious activities comprise the construction of a temple topped by golden lions and a finial, evidently therefore a Vaḍ abhī temple for a goddess,235 with a temple of Siva and an attached two-storied monastery ( ´ mat.ho dvibh ¯umiḥ) for the accommodation of ascetics to its south (v. 24), a temple with a [golden] finial, 

memory of the author of the inscription, to the effect that during the austerities that Parvat ¯ī undertook to win the hand of Siva her face was just as charming with ´ her ascetic’s braids as it had been with her elegantly adorned coiffure; for, says Kalid āsa: “The lotus is not beautiful only when when lines of bees hover about it ¯ but even when [strands of] duckweed cling to it” (na ṣat.padaśreṇibhir eva paṅkajaṁ sasaival ´ asa ¯ ngam ˙ api prakāśate). However, this solution has the weakness that it is not open to any obvious explanation of how the error arose. Perhaps the per son who wrote the letters on the stone before they were engraved was thinking of Vamarāśi’s official status in BenareṣIf that, as is very likely, was as the ab- ´ bot of a Saiva monastery, then the error ´-ādhīśam might be the result of the in trusion into his mind of an expression such as śaivādhīśam, śaivamat.hādhīśam, or śaivālayādhīśaṁ For the expression mat.hādhīśaḥ(=mat.hādhipatiḥ) see, e.g., Rājataraṅgiṇī 7.298ab: bhat.t.ārakamat.hadh ¯ ı¯sah ´.sādhur vyomaśivo jat.ī; and the anonymous Kumārapāladevacarita v. 51a: taṁ nimantrya mat.hadh ¯ ı¯sam´.(called mat.hādhipatiḥin v. 49b).

Buddhist Kings of Eastern India and their Commitment to Brahmanism 

Nor is it the case that royal devotion to the Buddha in eastern India dur ing this period weakened in this region the traditional commitment of Indian rulers to the imposition and preservation of the caste-based brahmanical social order in which Saivism was embeddeḍ For in the Neulpur grant of the Bhauma- ´ Kara king Subh ´ akara I his grandfather Ks ¯ .emankara is described both as a Bud- ˙ dhist and as having ensured that the members of the caste-classes and disci plines observed their prescribed roles;251 in his Teruṇ ḍia copper-plate inscription ¯ Subh ´ akara II, the grandson of ¯ Subh ´ akara I, is given the epithet ¯ paramasaugataḥ yet is also commended for having ‘propagated the system of uncommingled caste classes and disciplines proper to the [perfect] Kr̥ta Age following the unexcelled [brahmanical] scriptures’;252 the Pala Dharmap āla is described in a grant of his ¯ son Devapala both as a ¯ paramasaugataḥ and as taking measures to ensure that castes that erred were made to adhere to their respective duties, thereby dis charging his father’s debt to his deceased ancestors;253 and Vigrahapala III is ¯

Joint Patronage of Buddhism and Saivism in the Kingdoms of the Khmers, ´ Chams, and Javanese 

Much the same phenomenon can be seen in Southeast Asia among the Khmers, the Chams, and the Javanese. Among the first the dominant religion was Saivism until the rise of the Therav ´ ada that accompanied the decline of ¯ Angkor, and Tantric Buddhism, even when it enjoyed short periods of promi nence through exceptionally determined royal patronage, found itself bound, as I have shown elsewhere, to accommodate its rival.259 

In the kingdoms of the Chams, speakers of an Austronesian language who inhabitated the plains along the coast of the South China Sea in what is now the central part of Vietnam, most of the inscriptions that have survived, in Sanskrit and Old Cham, ranging in time from the fourth to the fifteenth centuries, record acts of royal piety to Siva or to goddesses identified with his consort. There ´ are also a few from the ninth and tenth centuries that record the installation of Tantric Mahayānist Loke ¯ svaras, the construction of associated Vih ´ aras, and ¯ land-grants to these. But as in eastern India we find in these that single donors supported both religionṣIndeed the situation is more striking here because in all but one case each of these inscriptions records a person’s practising both kinds of patronage, Buddhist and Saiva. ´ 260 Thus in the Bakul stele of 829 a Buddhist 

monk Sthavira Buddhanirvan¯ . a records that his father Samanta has donated two Viharas to the Buddha and two temples to ¯ Siva. ´ 261 The Dong Duong stele of 875 

records that King Jayendavarman alias Lakṣmīndra enshrined a Lakṣmīndra lokesvara and an associated Vih ´ ara, yet the bulk of this long inscription is de- ¯ voted to the praise of the Siva Bhadre ´ svara, who, we are told, is the source of this ´ dynasty’s power and prosperity.262 The Nhan-bieu stele records that in 908 Pov

This co-ordination of the two faiths is also evident in eastern Java. The ‘Cal cutta’ stone inscription of Airlangga (c. 1010–1050), founder of the kingdom of Kahuripan, reports in its Old Javanese section that he was consecrated as the king in 1019/20 by Buddhist (Saugata), Saiva (M ´ ahe ¯ svara), and Mah ´ abr āhman ¯ . a dignitaries;265 and much evidence of the simultaneous royal support of both Saivism and Buddhism during the Singhasari and Majapahit periods (1222– ´ 1292, 1293–c. 1500) is present in the Old Javanese poem Nāgarakr̥tāgama, also called Deśawarṇ ana, completed in 1365 by Mpu Prapanca during the reign of ˜ Hayam Wuruk of Majapahit, consecrated as R ājasanagara (1350–1389). We ¯ learn from this work that both Saiva and Buddhist priests participated in pe- ´ riodic ceremonies for the benefit of the realm within the great courtyard in side the royal gate of the palace compound,266 that the administrative heads

The term used here is the Sanskrit prāyaścittam (8.3d: prāyaścitta ri kālaning *śrawaṇ a [conj. PIGEAUD : grahaṇ a Coḍ] phalguṇ a makaphala hay waning sabh ¯uwana). The function of the ceremony, therefore, was expiatory: to cancel the effects of any errors, omissions, or excesses in observances and con duct during the period since the last performance. KERN, accepting the reading

(dharmādhyakṣa) of these two communities had official quarters in the east and west to the south of the royal compound,267 and that his sovereign was dedicated 

grahaṇ a phalguṇ a, took the occasion to be an eclipse during the month Phalgun ¯ . a. As PIGEAUD saw, this is implausible. He therefore proposed that grahaṇ a is an error for śrawaṇ a ‘the month Sr´ avan ¯ . a’, making this ceremony bi-annual and not ing that the resulting timing coincides with that of the two major festivals of the Majapahit court (1960–63, vol. 2, pp. 21–22). A trace of this co-functionality has survived into modern times on the island of Bali, where there are both Saiva and ´ Buddhist priests (padanda), with the latter now forming a small minority, about 1 in 10 and less than twenty in all (HOOYKAAS 1973, pp. 5 and 8), which sometimes had a role in state-sponsored rituals (STUART-FOX 2002, PP. 324 AND 326)).

PIGEAUD claims (ibiḍ) that both are regularly mentioned in the preambles of the royal charters of Majapahit. This is so in the Decree Jaya Song of c. 1350, the Ferry Charter of 1358, and the undated Charter of Batur (PIGEAUD 1960–1963, vol. 1, pp. 104–114 [edition]; vol. 3, pp. 151–164 [transla tion]). They are named in the first after the ministers: the Dharmadhyaks ¯ .a of the Saivas ( ´ dharmmadhyakṣa ring kaśewan), Rajapar ākrama, ālias Dharma raja, and the Dharm ādhyaks ¯ .a of the Buddhists (dharmmadhyakṣa ring kaso gatan) Ary ādhir āja Kanakamuni, described as a master of the Buddha’s teach- ¯ ings and grammar (boddhaśāstrawayākaraṇ aparisamāpta). In the second the Dharmadhyaks ¯ .a of the Buddhists has become Nadendra, described in the same ¯ way (boddhatarkkawyākaraṇ aśāstraparisamāpta) and we learn that the second name Dharmaraja of the Dharm ādhyaks ¯ .a of the Saivas is his ´ nāma puṣpapāta, that is to say, the name he acquired during his initiation through the casting of a flower (puṣpapātaḥ) in accordance with standard Saiva procedure (e.g. ´ Svacchanda tantra 4.62cd: puṣpapātavaśān nāma kārayet sādhakasya tu ‘He should name the Sadhaka in accordance with the casting of the flower’; ¯ Br̥hatkālottara f. 91v4 : puṣpapātānusāreṇ a saṁj ñā *tatp ¯urvato [eṁ : tatpātrato Coḍ] hitā ‘The [ele ment of the] name before that [such as -siva which indicates the initiate’s caste] ´ should be [given] in accordance with the casting of the flower’). In the third the Dharmadhyaks ¯ .a of the Buddhists is Ary ādhir āja [Kanakamuni], as in the first, de- ¯ scribed as a master of grammar and the [Buddhist] Tantras (wyakaraṇ atantrapari samāpta), and that of the Saivas is ´ Arya Hars ¯.araja, described as a master of logic ānd grammar (nyāyawyakaraṇ aśāstraparisamāpta). They are mentioned along with a number of other learned men, six in the first, seven in the second, and five in the third, referred to as “teachers of Law and settlers of law suits” (dharmmapra wakta wyawahārawicchedaka) in the first and second and as “settlers of law suits as valid or not” (nyāyānyāyawyawahārawicchedaka) in the thirḍ They are no doubt the officials referred to elsewhere as the Dharmopapattis (see here p.105). In the first they are (1) Siwan ´ atha, (2) Marman ātha, (3) Smaran ātha, (4) Jayasmara, (5) ¯ Agreswara, and (6) Mun ´īndra. In the second they are (1) Siwan ´ atha, (2) Agre ¯ swara, ´ (3) Jayasmara, (4) Widyanātha, (5) ¯ Siw´ adhipa, (6) ¯ Sr´īghana, and (7) Samataj¯ n˜ana. ¯ In the third they are (1) Marmanatha, (2) Smaran ātha, (3) Mah ānātha, (4) a second ¯ Smaranatha, and (5) Agre ¯ swara. Mun ´īndra in the first and Sr´īghana and Samata-¯ jn˜ ana in the second were Buddhists, a fact already evident from their names but ¯ confirmed by the charters’ reports of their fields of expert knowledge.

Marmanatha and Jayasmara were adherents of the Saura sect ( ¯ sorapakṣa), that is to say, Surya worshippers (see here p.58). The second and third charters do not ¯ specify the sects of the judges listed, so that the affiliations of Widyanātha, ¯ Siw´ a-¯ dhipa, one of the two Smaranathas, and Mah ānātha are unknowṇ It is striking ¯ that these judicial boards included no Vaiṣṇ avaṣThe absence of a representative of the R.ṣi sect, often grouped with those of the Saivas and Buddhists as one of the ´ three principal denominations in Java (e.g. Arjunawijaya 28.1c: r̥ṣi śaiwa sogata; Ku ñjarakarṇ a 22.3c: sang boddhaśaiwārṣipakṣa), is not surprising.

See also SANDERSON 2005a, pp. 374–376. The creation of the post of a Dharmadhyaks ¯ .a of the Buddhists and the inclusion of Buddhists on the judicial board were perhaps re cent developmentṣFor the Sarwadharma charter issued in 1269 during the reign of Kr̥tanagara (PIGEAUD 1960–1963, vol. 1, pp. 99–103 [edition]; vol. 3, pp. 143– 150) mentions only a Dharmadhyaks ¯ .a of the Saivas ( ´ Acārya ¯ Siwan ´ atha Tanutama: ¯ mpungku dharmmadhyakṣa ri kaśewan ḍ angācāryya śiwanātha mapa ñji tanu tama) together with a board of five other Acāryas, Dharmadewa, Smaradahana, ¯ Smaradewa, another Siwan ´ atha, and Agraja, not one of whom has an obviously ¯ Buddhist name (plate 2, recto, ll. 4–7).

The Lord of the Mountain (śrīparwwatanātha) addressed in this verse has been understood, im plausibly, as Siva. I am entirely persuaded by the evidence presented by S ´ UPOMO (1972; 1977, pp. 69–82) that it is the king that is intended in this and the opening verse of Mpu Tantular’s Arjunawijaya, where the Lord of the Mountain, in this case called Parwwatarajadewa, is identified as the physical manifestation of the ultimate ¯ reality that is the Buddha (1.1b: sang sākṣāt paramārthabuddha).

timate co-existence of the two traditions is also apparent in the intertextuality of religious texts in Java, as has been demonstrated for the Saiva ´ J ñānasiddhānta and the Tantric Buddhist Sang hyang Kamahāyānikan and Kalpabuddha.279 It is also seen in the great frequency with which the Mahayāna-Buddhist concept of ¯ emptiness (ś ¯unyatā) is incorporated in Javanese Saiva sources through the inclu- ´ sion of the terms ś ¯unya and ś ¯unyatā among those used to characterize the high est reality,280 in the readiness of the redactors of Saiva liturgies to supplement ´ sets of Saiva elements with Buddhist elements when they needed to make up a ´ total for the sake of the numerical correspondence,281 and in the fact that the Ku ñjarakarṇ a of the Buddhist Mpu D. usun the supreme Buddhist deity Vairo

On the significance of the Saiva-Buddhist fusion seen in Kr ´.tanagara in both inscriptions and literary works see HUNTER 2007. 

279 See SOEBADIO 1971, pp. 12–19 and 55–57 for evidence of this intertextuality; also for a general treatment of the co-existence of the two traditions in Java ZOETMUL DER in STOHR ¨ and ZOETMULDER 1968, pp. 262–314.

I consider it highly probable that these Sanskrit works are Javanese creationṣSome of the verses can be found in Indian Saiva ´ sources: Wr̥haspatitattwa 53 and Gaṇ apatitattwa 3 < Rauravas ¯utrasaṁ graha 7.5; J ñānasiddhānta 19.5 and and Gaṇ apatitattwa 43 < Kiraṇ a 1.23; Wr̥haspatitattwa 7–10 < Svāyambhuvas ¯utrasaṁ graha 4.3–6. But these are surprisingly few, and the works contain several doctrinal elements that are alien to known Indian tra ditionṣMoreover, the deviations from strict Sanskrit usage found in them seem to me not to be characteristic of the registers of the language seen in Indian Saiva ´ scriptural textṣThe same is true of the frequent deviations from the correct form of the Anuṣt.ubh in the second and fourth Padas: e.g. ¯ Gaṇ apatitattwa 1d, 16d, 48d, 49b, 49d, 54b, 54d, 55b, 59b, 59d; Mahāj ñāna 11d, 37b, 38d, 42b, 61b, 73b, 74b, 78b, 78d, 80d; Wr̥haspatitattwa 3b, 6b, 6d, 12b, 20d, 23b, 24b, 25b, 63b, 72ḍ This is extremely rare in Indian Saiva textṣ´

Yet although these two dhātu are different, how is it possible to differentiate between them at a glance? In the same manner, the reality that is Jina and the reality that is Siva are one; they ´ are different yet they are one, for there is no duality in the dharma”. Comment ing on “the two different dhātu” mentioned in this verse (fn. 9) SUPOMO take them to be the two Maṇ ḍ alas, the Garbhadhatu and the Vajradh ātu of the ¯ Mahāvairo canābhisaṁ bodhi and Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁ graha respectively. This reading is an error in my view. It does not accord with context, which requires that the two be the realities of the Buddha (jinatwa) and Siva ( ´śiwatattwa) respectively. As I understand it, the passage is saying that the Lord Buddha is both the Buddha

THE DEVELOPMENT OF TANTRIC BUDDHISM THROUGH THE ADOPTION AND ADAPTATION OF S´ AIVA AND S´ AKTA ¯ S´ AIVA MODELS 

The Parallel Repertoire of Rituals 

Now, this co-existence of Buddhism and Saivism under royal patronage was ´ surely facilitated by the fact that the form of Buddhism adopted and developed was one that had equipped itself not only with a pantheon of ordered sets of deities that permitted such subsumptive equations but also with a repertoire of Tantric ceremonies that parallelled that of the Saivas and indeed had mod- ´ elled itself upon it, offering initiation by introduction before a Maṇ ḍ ala in which the central deity of the cult and its retinue of divine emanations have been in stalled, and a system of regular worship animated by the principle of identifi cation with the deity of initiation (devatāhaṁ kāraḥ, devatāgarvaḥ) through the use of Mantras, Mudras, visualization, and fire-sacrifice ( ¯ homaḥ); and this was presented not only as a new and more powerful means of attaining Buddha-hood but also, as in the Saiva case, as enabling the production of supernatural ef- ´ fects (siddhiḥ) such as the averting of danger (śāntiḥ), the harming of enemies (abhicāraḥ), and the control of the rain (varṣāpaṇ am and ativr̥ṣt.idhāraṇ am), through symbolically appropriate inflections of the constituents of these proce dureṣThe latter is particularly important from the point of view of Buddhism’s relations with its royal patrons, since such rituals enabled it to match the Saivas ´ by promising kings more tangible benefits than the mere accumulation of merit through the support of the Buddha, his teaching, and the Sangha. We have seen ˙ an example of such ritual for the protection of the state in Taran ātha’s report ¯ of the programme of Tantric fire-sacrifices performed at Vikramas´īla under the direction of Buddhajn˜ana during the reign of Dharmap āla (r̥ ¯ c. 775–812) to en sure the longevity of the Pala dynasty; ¯288 we have another example in the case of Kīrtipaṇ ḍita, a Mahayāna-Buddhist scholar and Tantric expert who according to ¯ the Vat Sithor stele inscription became the Guru of the Khmer king Jayavarman V (r̥ 968–1001) and was engaged by him to perform frequent fire-sacrifices in the palace for the protection of the kingdom;289 and the Javanese Prapanca tells ˜ us that the purpose of king Kr̥tanagara’s adherence to Tantric Buddhism was 

and Siva, whereas S ´ UPOMO’s reading makes Mpu Tantular espouse a doctrine of absolute equality between the two religions within a reality beyond botḥ This is intrinsically implausible in a Buddhist work. My reading makes his view exactly that expressed by Mpu D. usun in 23.4bcd of the Ku ñjarakarṇ a cited and translated above: “‘I, Vairocana, am embodied both as the Buddha and as Siva”. ´

to increase his people’s prosperity and the stability of his realm, and that its reward was the undiminished and undivided sovereignty (ekachattra) of his de scendantṣ290 

The adoption of the Saiva practice of Man ´. ḍ ala initiation created a further line of access to patronage and was propagated vigorously, as it was by the Saivas, as a means of the recruiting of social ´ elites both in the subcontinent and ´ beyonḍ291 Among the Buddhist Tantras at least two major texts teach rituals of initiation, or consecration (abhiṣekaḥ) as it is called in these sources, in which it is kings in particular and royalty in general that are envisaged as the pri mary initiandṣThese are the Ma ñjuśriyam ¯ulakalpa and the Sarvadurgatipari- śodhanatantra.292 In the former this is so for the principal Kalpa of the text. In the latter it is characteristic of initiation into the secondary Maṇ ḍ alas of the four Great Kings and the ten Guardians of the Directions taught in the Uttarakalpa. The sections dealing with these Maṇ ḍ alas specify the king as the principal con secrand, teach little or no required subsequent practice, and promise benefits that apply principally to him, namely the protection of himself and his kingdom and the destruction of the kingdoms of his enemieṣThe monarch is not men tioned in the treatments of initiation given in the Mahāvairocanābhisaṁ bodhi and Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁ graha, the two great Tantras that were translated into Chinese in the early eighth century to form the basis of the Way of Mantras there and in the Japanese Shingon and Tendai sectṣBut the ninth-century In dian authority Anandagarbha brings this aspect of the religion to the fore in his ¯ Sarvavajrodaya, an influential manual that sets out detailed practical guidance for the performance of the initiation ritual taught in the second of those texts but draws heavily on the more detailed treatment in the first. For when he teaches the preparation of the Maṇ ḍ ala he prescribes a range of sizes beginning with that appropriate for the initiation of the monarcḥ In his case each of the sides should measure one hundred or fifty cubits (about 40 and 20 metres), in the case of a feudatory (sāmantaḥ) or major feudatory (mahāsāmantaḥ) fifty or twenty-five, in the case of a wealthy merchant (śreṣt.hī) or international trader (sārthavāhaḥ) twenty-five or half of that, and in the case of an ordinary practitioner (sādhakaḥ)

The Mantranaya also followed the example of the Saivas by devising Tantric ´ ceremonies for patrons in the public domain: for the consecration (pratiṣt.hā) of temple images (pratimā), paintings of deities on cloth (pat.aḥ), manuscripts of sacred texts (pustakam), monasteries (vihāraḥ), shrines (gandhakut.ī), Caityas, reservoirs (puṣkariṇ yādi), gardens and the like (ārāmādi). It also adapted the Saiva procedures for funerary initiation to produce a Tantric Buddhist funeral ´

294 The details of this wide repertoire of the rituals that a Tantric Buddhist offi ciant (Vajracārya) was called on to perform are set out in a number of man- ¯ uals that are closely comparable to the Paddhatis of the Saivas, notably the ´ Kriyāsaṁ grahapa ñjikā of Kuladatta (TANEMURA 2004b), the Vajrāvalī of the great Abhayakaragupta of Vikrama ¯ s´īla (1064–1125 according to the chronologi cal tables of Sum pa mkhan po Yes shes dpal ’byor [1704–1788]; works dated in the twenty-fifth, thirtieth, and thirty-seventh years of the reign of Ramap āla ¯ [c. 1072–1126]; Vajrāvalī written before the first of these; see BUHNEMANN ¨ and TACHIKAWA 1991, pp. xiv–xvi), which adds procedures for the consecration of reser voirs, gardens, and the like (A, f. 2r1 in the list of topics: pratimādipratiṣt.hā | puṣkariṇ yādipratiṣt.hā |ārāmādipratiṣt.hā), and the Acāryakriyāsamuccaya ¯ of Mahaman ¯ . ḍ alacārya Jagaddarpan ¯ . a, which incorporates much of the Vajrāvalī but adds some new material, notably a final section on the funeral ritual for a de ceased Vajracārya ( ¯ nirvr̥tavajrācāryāntyeṣt.ilakṣaṇ avidhiḥ; B, ff. 240v7–244v4), which is an unacknowledged incorporation of the whole of the Mr̥tasugatiniyojana of Paṇ ḍita S´unyasam ādhivajra (less its two colophonic verses). One other text giv- ¯ ing a Tantric funeral procedure survives in Sanskrit, the Antasthitikarmoddeśa, at the end (ff. 15r8–15v11) of the Guhyasamāja-based Maṇ ḍ alopāyikā of Maṇ ḍ alacārya Padma ¯ sr´īmitra of the Khasarpaṇ a monastery (f. 15v10–11: samāptā ca maṇ ḍ alopāyikā | kr̥tir iyaṁ khasarpaṇīyamaṇ ḍ alācāryapadmaśrīmitrasya). On these texts and the incorporation of the Mr̥tasugatiniyojana by Jagaddarpaṇ a see TANEMURA 2004a and 2007. On the Saiva prototype of funerary initiation see ´ SANDERSON 1995a, pp. 31–33 and, for its adaptation, the Mr̥toddhāradīkṣā, in which a simulacrum is substituted for the body of the deceased, 2005b, pp. 264–267. A fourteenth-century Paddhati for this Mr̥toddhāradīkṣā survives in ff. 88v1–91r1 of the Gurupustikā of the Kashmirian Rajānaka ¯ Sitikan ´.t.ha. In an earlier publi cation (SANDERSON 2007a, p. 395, fn. 549) I proposed that this work, then known to me only indirectly from the Rājānakavaṁśapraśaṁsā of his patrilineal descen dant Rajānaka ¯ Ananda, who reports that it was composed at the request of [king] ¯ Saṁ gramasim ¯ . ha, might be preserved in a S´ arad ā manuscript listed with this ti- ¯ tle as belonging to the Sayaji Rao Gaekwad Central Library of the Banaras Hindu University (MS CN. 4115). I can now report that this is indeed a manuscript of that work and, as far as I am aware, its codex unicuṣThe name of the author is confirmed on f. 1v11–12: karmānup ¯urvīsmr̥taye keṣāṁcid upayoginīm | śitikaṇt.has samasyaināṁ vidhatte gurupustikām; and the claim that he wrote at the re quest of Saṁ gramasim ¯ . ha is confirmed on f. 13v15–14r1: asmākaṁ kulaśiṣyeṇ a śrīsaṅgrāmamahībhujā | abhyarthitānāṁ dīkṣārtham ayaṁ paddhatidohadaḥ.

reading my remark that I had not yet seen the manuscript very kindly acquired and sent me scans of it. 

295 According to Padmasr´īmitra the ritual is to be done for Acāryas and others who have ¯ practised the meditation-rite of Vajrasattva or some other Tantric deity; f. 15r8, v. 1: mr̥tācāryādisattvā ye vajrasattvādiyoginaḥ| vakṣ<y>e cāntasthite<ḥ > kr̥tyaṁ teṣāṁ mārganidarśanāt.

S´unyasam ādhivajra does ¯ not specifiy those for whom it is intendeḍ But Jagaddarpaṇ a adds a preamble to S´unyasam ādhivajra’s text in which he restricts it to Vajr ācāryas; f. 240v7: ādhunā parinirvr̥tavajrācāryaśarīrasyānteṣt.ividhir ucyate.

According to the Maṇ ḍ alopāyikā, the Acārya should ¯ trace and worship the Maṇ ḍ ala, offer a Bali, and then place the corpse at its east gate with its head to the south; f. 15r12–13, vv. 12–13b: same viśuddhabh ¯ubhāge gomayenopalepite | maṇ ḍ alaṁcatuśraṁ vai kārayet tatra saṁ kiret k śuklaṁ pītaṁ rajo vāpi tatra padma*dalāṣt.akam (conj. : dalābhakam Coḍ); f. 15r13, vv. 18c–19: uttarābhimukho mantrī saṁ p ¯ujya maṇ ḍ alaṁ baliṁk dattvārghādikaṁcaiva saṁ- sādhya maṇ ḍ alaṁ kr̥tī | sthāpayen maṇ ḍ aladvāri prācyāṁtu dakṣiṇāmukhaṁ

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

The Mahāvairocanābhisaṁ bodhi, the Ma ñjuśriyam ¯ulakalpa, and Buddhaguhya 

That this transformation of the Mahayāna had been achieved by absorbing ānd adapting non-Buddhist practices was evident from the beginning. For the Mahāvairocanābhisaṁ bodhi, our first major Buddhist Tantra,298 later classified as the principal work of the Caryatantra class, was conscious that it would be āccused of just this: 

O [Vajrapan¯ .i,] Lord of the Yakṣas, in time to come there will arise people of in ferior understanding and no faith who will not believe this teaching. They will dissent and have many doubtṣThey will hear it but they will not take it to heart and they will refuse to put it into practice. Being themselves unworthy they will bring others too to ruiṇ [For] they will say that this is not the teaching of the Buddhas but belongs to the outsiderṣ299 

(eṁ [Tib. rdo rje rtse nas rlung gis bskyod pa yi ’bar ba rnams kyis]: jvalad bhivajrāgraumārutoddhr̥tair Coḍ) k *udgacchad tad (corr̥ [Tib. de ni ’phar bar] : udgacchantaṁ Coḍ) dhyāyād dahanārci<ḥ >spr̥śyamānapāradavad | * ¯urdhvāgnena (?) (Tib. steng gi sgo nas) vimuktiṁ buddhakṣetraṁ viśuddhaṁ vā ‘Then the Mantrin should take a blade of Kusa grass, visualize a sharp one- ´ pointed Vajra at its tip, place [that tip] at the aperture of the [corpse’s] penis and imagine that it is burning. Then concentrating his mind he should cause the shin ing consciousness that he has installed in the heart [of the corpse] to be driven [up from the heart] by blazing wind-fanned Vajra-points and he should visualize it rising to liberation or a pure Buddha-field through the upper [aperture], like [a drop of] quick silver touched by tongues of fire’. The ‘upper’ is one of nine aper tures through which consciousness can leave the body at death (utkrāntiḥ). It is located at the top of the head and is called ‘the golden door’ (kanakadvāram) by Bhavabhat.t.a in his commentary on the Catuṣpīt.hatantra (Catuṣpīt.hanibandha), f. 52r2: urdhve ¯ ti kanakadvāreṇ a yadā gacchati tadā maraṇād ¯urdhvaṁśīghram eva gater gatyantaraṁ viśiṣt.aṁ gacchati. The point of exit depends upon the destiny of the deceaseḍ This is the best. According to S´unyasam ādhivajra consciousness that ¯ exits at death through this aperture goes to the Immaterial World (ār ¯upyadhātuḥ): śirasār ¯upyaṁ gacchet (f. 3r4). This idea that consciousness may leave the body through various exits in accordance with its destiny is found widely in Brahmani cal sourceṣEarly Buddhist sources speak rather of consciousness ceasing at death at these points in the body; see Abhidharmakośabhāṣya on 3.43abc. Vasubandhu says there that in the case of Arhats their consciousness disappears in the heart according to some and in the head according to others: arhantaḥ| teṣām api hr̥daye vij ñānaṁ nirudhyate | m ¯urdhnīty apare.

The Ma ñjuśriyam ¯ulakalpa, another early Buddhist Tantric text,300 assigned to the lowest class of Mantranaya texts, known as the Kriyatantras, is more ¯ explicit in this regard; and it has good reason to be so since it contains in its chapters 47–49 an assimilated version of the cult of Tumburu and his four sis ters, that is to say, the cult of the vāmasrotaḥ division of the Saiva Vidy ´ ap¯īt.ha, describing the Mantras of these deities as the highest and most secret of all the non-Buddhist (laukika-) Mantraṣ301 Moreover, it teaches that any of the 

300 The date of this text is obscure. MATSUNAGA (1985) is of the opinion that the 9th chapter, on applications of the Ekaks ¯ .aramantra, was in existence before the Chinese translations T. 1181 of A.D. 702 and T. 1182 of A.D. 703. He also in forms us (ibiḍ) that the first ninety percent of the Chinese translation of the Garuḍ apat.alaparivarta (T. 1276), produced at some time between 746 and 774, is identical with the first sixty percent of the 41st chapter of the Ma ñjuśriyam ¯ulakalpa as editeḍ The translation is attributed to Amoghavajra (705–774), but MAT SUNAGA observes (ibiḍ) that only the first part of the common text is in keeping with his other translations, the latter part containing elements such as human hair, beef, and skull-cups, which taken together are altogether alien to his Mantranaya. He strengthens the hypothesis that only the first part of this translation is by Amoghavajra with the evidence of the Go-sh¯orai mokuroku, a catalogue of the Bud dhist texts brought from China to Japan by Kukai in 806, which lists this text as oc- ¯ cupying three sheets, a third of the length of T. 1276. The prophetic history of Indian Buddhism, the Rājavyākaraṇ a, chapter 53 of the published Majuśriyam ¯ulakalpa, cannot be earlier that the late eighth century since it knows of the Pala king Gop āla ¯ (r̥ c. 750–775) (53.628; and 53.816: tataḥ pareṇ a *bh ¯upālo gopālo [eṁ : bh ¯upālā gopālā Eḍ] dāsajīvinaḥ| bhaviṣyati). Since it does not mention his successor Dharmapala it is unlikely to be later̥ ¯ 

301 Ma ñjuśriyam ¯ulakalpa, introductory prose before 47.1: sarvalaukikamantrāṇāṁ sārabh ¯utatamaṁ paramarahasyaṁ. The position within Saivism assigned by this ´ text to the cult of the four sisters suggests that, though later largely eclipsed by other traditions of the Vidyap¯īt.ha, it was once pre-eminent; and this is also cir cumstantial evidence in favour of the hypothesis proposed above (p. 50) that this cult was one of the earliest, perhaps the earliest, of the esoteric Saiva systemṣ´ There is certainly much other evidence of its early centrality. As we have seen, it was known to Dharmakīrti (here p. 50), and a 6th-century manuscript of one of its texts survives amid the otherwise Buddhist Gilgit manuscripts (here p. 50). The Viṣṇ udharmottara shows knowledge of only two Saiva deity-systems in its ´ section on iconography: the Saiddhantika and this (3, ¯ Adhyāya 66, teaches the iconography of Tumburu and his sisters). The Advaitin Sa´ nkara in his ˙ Gītābhāṣya on Bhagavadgītā 9.25, in which it is said that those who worship the Spirits (bh ¯utejyāḥ) reach the Spirits (bh ¯utāni yānti) [when they die], glosses bh ¯utāni as vināyakamātr̥ gaṇ acaturbhaginyādīni ‘such as Vinayaka, the Mothers, and the Four ¯ Sisters’. On his date, probably eighth century, see HARIMOTO 2006. These deities were also incorporated in the traditions of Maṇ ḍ alas of the Nayas ¯utra and the Mahāvairocanābhisaṁ bodhi that reached the Far East in the eighth century (see SANDERSON 2001, p. 8, fn. 5). Their cult was the basis of the Saiva ritual performed ´ to inaugurate the kingdom of Angkor at the beginning of the ninth century (ibiḍ and 2005a, pp. 355–358); and there too, where the Mantramarga was preserved in ān early form, we see only the Siddhanta of its earliest texts and this cult. This ¯ co-existence is also evident in the Saiva liturgies of Java and Bali, which are of ´ Saiddhantika character but incorporate these deities (see G ¯ OUDRIAAN 1973 and

Mantra-procedures taught in the Saiva and G ´ arud ¯ . a Tantras302 will be effec tive if applied by Buddhists in the Maṇ ḍ ala of these converted deitieṣ303 Thus the Buddhists envisaged by this text have the whole array of Saiva Mantras ´ at their disposal; and this position, so surprising from the conventional Bud dhist standpoint, is justified by the claim that what people have come to refer to as the Saiva, G ´ arud ¯ . a, and indeed Vaiṣṇ ava Tantras are in fact Buddhist, since they were first taught by Manju ˜ sr´ī in this “vast Kalpa”, that is to say, in the Ma ñjuśriyam ¯ulakalpa or, more probably, in a hypothetical proto-text of which the actual text was thought to be an abbreviated redaction:304 

I have taught this Mantra [of Siva] which together with the trident Mudr ´ a¯ destroys all demons, out of my desire to benefit living beingṣThose living on the earth will say that its ancient Kalpa, that I taught in former times, was taught by Siva. [But] the various excellent extensive [Kalpas] in the ´ Saiva Tantras are ´ in fact my teachingṣ

. . . 

The extensive Kalpas that have been related in the Vaiṣṇ avas Tantras were taught by Manjughos ˜ .a for living beings who could only be trained by [this] device.305 

. . . 

All the extensive Kalpas taught in the Garud ¯ . a Tantras were taught by me in order to benefit living beingṣ306 

. . . 

It was I that first taught, in this vast Kalpa, everything that the inhabitants of earth without exception refer to as the teaching of Siva. It was only later ´ that others taught in the various texts [considered to be taught by him] the Kalpamantras of the wise Siva Tumburu the Trader̥ ´ 307

If this is so, then the text has disarmed criticism that the Mantra-procedures that are presented as properly Buddhist in this text bear a suspiciously close re semblance to the non-Buddhist in their liturgical morphology. For if the Omni scient has revealed all forms of religion in consideration of the differing mental dispositions of his manifold audiences, then there is no reason at all why he should not in his wisdom have taught Tantric practice for Buddhists as well as for outsiderṣThe strict division between the Buddhist and the non-Buddhist has dissolved within a higher Buddhist intertextual unity. Indeed this very ar gument is deployed by *Buddhaguhya in the late eighth century in his commen tary on the passage of the Mahāvairocanābhisaṁ bodhi cited above.308 He argues that what those who attack this Tantra for containing elements proper to the non-Buddhist Tantras fail to realize is that those Tantras too were taught by the omniscient Buddha.309 So it follows that there nothing inherently un-Buddhist in

308 *Buddhaguhya’s teaching in the Kriya- and Cary ā- divisions of the Tantras is said ¯ by Gzhon nu dpal (Blue Annals, p. 351) to have been pre-eminent in Tibet dur ing the first transmission of Esoteric Buddhism, from the latter half of the eighth century; and this is confirmed by the Tibetan inventory of Buddhist texts in trans lation compiled in the Ldan dkar palace in the early ninth century. Its small sec tion of Tantras (gsang sngags kyi rgyud: entries 316–328) consists of nine texts of this class together with commentaries on the last four, of which three are ascribed to our author, those on the Vairocanābhisaṁ bodhi, the Sarvadurgatipariśodhana tejorājakalpa, and the Dhyānottara. The entry on the fourth commentary, that on the Subāhu[paripr̥cchā], lacks the name of its author, but it is at least probable that it was from the same hand, since no other Indian commentary on this text is knowṇ The loss of the Sanskrit originals of these and other works of early exegesis has left us without the means of confirming that his name, rendered Sangs rgyas gsang ba in Tibetan, was indeed Buddhaguhya, as modern scholarship has gener ally assumeḍ The evidence is inconclusive. For when the name appears in Tibetan sources in transcription rather than translation we find sometimes Buddhaguhya and sometimes Buddhagupta. We see the latter in the Ldan dkar inventory (LALOU 1953, p. 326: slob dpon Bu ddha gu pta) and both forms are found in the colophons of the translations of his works in the Tenjur (HODGE 1994, p. 70). The Tenjur con tains a letter (Toḥ 4194) in which *Buddhaguhya addresses the Tibetan emperor ¯ Khri srong lde btsan, who ruled from c. 756 until c. 797 (DOTSON 2007) and offi cially adopted Buddhism c. 779. From it we learn that he was invited to Tibet by Khri srong lde btsan but declined the invitation on the grounds of failing strength, sending instead his commentary on the Mahāvairocanābhisaṁ bodhi.

Buddhist Tantric practice, however closely it may resemble the Saiva; and Bud- ´ dhists, therefore, once they have understood this fact, may devote themselves with full confidence to the rituals of the Mahāvairocanābhisaṁ bodhi.

After the time of this text Tantric Buddhism did not, as one might expect, rest content with the degree of assimilation of Saivism it had already achieved, ´

This doc trine that all teaching is the Buddha’s, that he has taught variously in the appear ance of the Buddha, Siva, and others, is set out in the ´ Mahāvairocanābhisaṁ bodhi in a passage that survives in Sanskrit through its citation in the Nāmamantrā rthāvalokinī, Vilasavajra’s eighth-century commentary on the ¯ Nāmasaṁ gīti, on verse 42, f. 31v1–32r2: tathā coktaṁśrīvairocanābhisaṁ bodhitantre | bhaga vantas tathāgatā arhantaḥsamyaksaṁ buddhāḥsarvaj ñaj ñānaṁ prāpya tat sarva j ñaj ñānaṁsarvasattvebhyo vibhajya nānānayair nānābhiprāyair nānopāyanayair dharmaṁ deśayanti sma | keṣāṁcit śrāvakayānanayaṁ keṣāṁcit pratyekabuddha yānanayaṁ keṣāṁcin mahāyānanayaṁ keṣāṁcit pa ñcābhij ñaj ñānanayaṁ keṣāṁ cid devopapattaye keṣāṁcin manuṣyopapattaye yāvan mahoragayakṣarākṣasā suragandharvagaruḍ akinnarādyupapattaye dharmaṁ deśayanti sma | tatra ke cit sattvā buddhavaineyikā buddhar ¯upeṇ a paśyanti. ke cic chrāvakar ¯upeṇ a ke cit pratyekabuddhar ¯upeṇ a ke cid bodhisattvar ¯upeṇ a ke cin maheśvarar ¯upeṇ a ke cid brahmar ¯upeṇ a ke cin nārāyaṇ ar ¯upeṇ a paśyanti sma | ke cid vaiśravaṇ a r ¯upeṇ a yāvan mahoragamanuṣyāmanuṣyar ¯upeṇ a paśyanti sma | svakasvakair vacanodāhāraṇ anayair vividheryāpatha<ṁ > vyavasthitam | tac ca sarvaj ñaj ñānam ekarasaṁ yad uta tathatāvinirmuktirasam ityāha mahāvairocana iti. This is closely related to and probably derives from the vaineyadharmopadeśaḥ, the eighth Prakaraṇ a of the second Nirvy ¯uha of the Kāraṇ ḍ avy ¯uha (pp. 268–269). The Sad dharmapuṇ ḍ arīka likewise teaches (pp. 251–252) that Avalokitesvara assumes all ´ kinds of forms, including that of Siva, in order to teach living beings in considera- ´ tion of their particular dispositionṣSTRICKMANN informs us (1996, p. 440, ṇ 28) that this passage is present in the Chinese translation completed by Dharmarakṣa in A.D. 286. It is probable that it is the model of the passage in the Kāraṇ ḍ avy ¯uha. The doctrine that the non-Buddhist teachers are a device (upāyaḥ) of the Buddha is also taught in the fourth chapter of the Bodhisattvagocaropāyaviṣayavikurvaṇ a nirdeśas ¯utra, which survives in two Chinese translations, the first by Guṇ abhadra in the fifth century; see ZIMMERMANN 2000, p. 18.

working only to infuse the new liturgical system with ever more clearly Buddhist purpose and meaning. On the contrary, with the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁ graha, the next major Tantra, which was considered to be the foundational text of the Yogatantra class, which follows the Caryatantras in the ascending hierarchy of ¯ the classification of the Mantranaya, and was in existence in a shorter version by the end of the seventh century and expanded in the course of the eighth,310 we find the beginning of a process of assimilation of S´ akta ¯ Saiva language, practices, ´ iconography, and concepts that would become ever more comprehensive through out the rest of the Mantranaya’s creativity. Here we find for the first time the requirement that candidates enter a state of possession (āveśaḥ) at the time of their initiatioṇ This feature, which is altogether alien to antecedent Buddhism, is the hallmark of initiation in the Saiva Kaula systems, setting them apart from ´ all otherṣ311 The Vajracārya puts the candidate into a state of possession, has ¯ 

310 See MATSUNAGA 1978, pp. xvii–xvii. 

311 See, e.g., Tantrāloka 29.186c–220; Tantrālokaviveka introducing 29.201c–202b: samāveśaḥsarvaśāstreṣv avigānenoktaḥ; SANDERSON 1985, pp. 200–202; 1986, p. 169 and fn. 2; and WALLIS 2008. The centrality of possession in the S´ akta ¯ Saiva do- ´ main may derive from its Kapālika antecedents, since the Saiddh āntika ¯ Saivas re- ´ port that the Kapālikas [of the Atim ārga] defined liberation as arising from a state ¯ of possession (āveśaḥ) by the qualities of the deity, analogous to the state of one who is possessed by a Bhuta ( ¯ bh ¯utāviṣt.apuruṣavat [Nareśvaraparīkṣāprakāśa on 1.61]); see, e.g., Pauṣkarabhāṣya, p. 232: svayamāviśyate siddhaḥ puruṣas tu gra hair iva | itthaṁcaiva tu kāpālās tat sāmyaṁ muktim ¯ucire; and Saivaparibhās ´.ā, p. 156, ll. 22-24: kāpālikāḥsamāveśena sāmyam upagacchanti | tathā hi yathā grahāḥ puruṣamāviśanti tatheśvaraguṇā mukteṣvāviśanti. They are distinguished in this context from the two other Atimargic traditions, those of the P ā¯nc˜ arthika ¯ Pa¯supatas, who defined liberation as the transference of the state of equality with ´ Siva in the manner in which one lamp is lit from another ( ´ sāmyasaṁ krāntivādaḥ), and the Lakulas, who defined it as the arising of this state ( ¯ sāmyotpattivādaḥ); see SANDERSON 2006, pp. 179–181. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that possession by the deity as the goal of practice is a marked feature of the Picumata and Yoginīsaṁcāra of the Vidyap¯īt.ha, texts in which the perpetuation within the Mantramarga of the K āpālika tradition of the Atim ārga is particularly clear̥ Both ¯ describe the goal of their Kapālika-style asceticism as the entry of the deity pro- ¯ pitiated into the person of the propitiator̥ Picumata f. 101v1–3 (2.114c–117): duścaraṁ devagandharvais tvayā cīrṇ aṁ mahāvratam k 115 varaṁ varepsitaṁ vatsa udyataṁtu bravīhi me | yadi tuṣt.o ’si bhagavan praviśa mama vigraham k 116 vaktram prasārayasveti praviśya bhagavān prabhuḥ| hr̥daye bhairavo devo guhyakā tu gale sthitāḥk 117 mātaro hy aṅga-m-aṅgeṣu yoginyo sandhiṣu sthitāḥ| śākinyo romak ¯upeṣu p ¯utanādyā tathaiva ca ‘[Bhairava says:] You have [now] com pleted the observance of the [Kapālika] Mah āvrata, which is hard [even] for the ¯ gods and GandharvaṣChoose whatever boon you desire.

and, after the bindfold has been removed:314 

As soon as he sees the Great Maṇ ḍ ala he is entered-and-empowered by all the Tathagatas and Vajrasattva dwells in his heart. He sees various visions of ¯ orbs of light and miraculous transformationṣBecause he has been entered and-empowered by all the Tathagatas sometimes the Lord Vajradhara or the ¯ Buddha appears to him in his true forṁ From that time forth he attains all his goals, every desire of his mind, all Siddhis, up to the state of Vajradhara or the Tathagataṣ¯ 

Anandagarbha gives a detailed account of the means by which the candidate ¯ is put into this state of possession in the Sarvavajrodaya, his manual on the rites of initiation into the Maṇ ḍ ala of this Tantra, and makes it clear that entering this state is, as in the Kaula parallel, an absolute requirement. If the candidate fails to enter it by the standard means, the Vajracārya is to perform a rite to remove ¯ the sins that are assumed to be the cause, and if the candidate still fails to enter the possession state, he may not proceed further:315 

If possession does not occur, because [the candidate] has committed [too] many sins, he should proceed to destroy those sins by repeatedly making the Sin Destruction Mudra. With concentrated mind he should kindle a fire with sticks ¯ of sweet wood and burn all his sins by casting into it oblations of sesame seeds with the Mantra OM. SARVAPAPADAHANAVAJR ¯ AYA SV ¯ AH¯ A¯. He should make a simulacrum of those sins with black sesame seeds on the palm of his right hand and visualizing the [wrathful] syllable HUM¯.in the centre he should offer it into the fire with his index finger and thumb. Then he should imagine that the sin is being incinerated in his body by Vajras wrapped in flames emerging from the fire-pit. [The candidate] will definitely become possesseḍ If possession does not occur even so, then he must not give him the consecratioṇ316

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

It is certain that the possession intended is not nominal or figurative. For Anandagarbha tells us that once the Vajr ācārya is sure that the candidate is in ¯ this state he should use him as an oracle:317 

Then when the Acārya has ascertained that [the candidate] is possessed he should ¯ form the Samayamudra of Vajrasattva and address him with [the Mantras] ¯ HE VAJRASATTVA HE VAJRARATNA HE VAJRADHARMA HE VAJRAKARMA and NR. TYA SATTVA NR. TYA VAJRA (DANCE, O SATTVA; DANCE, O VAJRA). If he is indeed possessed he will adopt the Vajrasattvamudra. Then the ¯ Acārya should show the ¯ 

Mudra of the Vajra Fist. By this means all the deities beginning with Vajrasattva ¯ make themselves present [in him]. Then he should ask him something that he wishes [to ascertain], with the following [procedure]. He should visualize a Vajra on the tongue of the possessed and say SPEAK, O VAJRA. [The candidate] then tells him everything [that he wishes to know].318 

means he should visualize him being burned both internally and externally by the Power [of the Mantra] taught above. By this means he will fall to the grounḍ If a person does not achieve [the state of possession] even by this means then in this [system] he must cast him aside like a stone’. Falling to the ground is commonly mentioned in Kaula texts as the consequence of initiatory possession; see, e.g., Matasāra f. 39v2–3: yāvanmātraṁ vihvalaṁca vedhayet pāśapa ñjaram | pāśastobhāt patatyāśu bh ¯utale nātra saṁśayaḥ; Jayadrathayāmala, S. at.ka 4, bhairavānanāvidhau bh ¯umikāpat.alaḥ, f. 191v (v. 105ab): śaktikṣobhāt tadā yogī viddho patati bh ¯utale; Devīdvyardhaśatikā f. 16v: 197 tatkṣaṇāt patate bh ¯umau chinnam ¯ula iva drumaḥ; Chummāsaṁ ketaprakāśa, first surviving verse: [ta]ddr̥ kpātamahodayāt | bh ¯umau sampatitaḥ kṣiprāc chinnam ¯ula iva drumaḥ; Urmikaulārn ¯. ava f. 9r3: *pa ñcāvasthāgataḥ(eṁ : pa ñcāvasvagataḥ Coḍ) sākṣāt sa viddhaḥ patate bhuvi; f. 19v5–6 (2.230–231): pracalanti *mahāpāśā (corr̥ : mahāpāśam Coḍ)āveśaṁtasya jāyate |ānando hy udbhavaḥ kampo nidrā gh ¯urmis tu pa ñcamī k tattvaviddhasya deveśi pa ñcāvasthā bhavanti hi | sa viddhaḥ patate bh ¯umau vajrapātād ivācala<ḥ >; the Kaula Vr̥ddhasvacchanda ff. 17v24–18r2, Eḍ 10.15c–17a (using this MS alone): j ñātvā śrīśaktisaṁ krāmaṁsadevāsuramānuṣān k *vedhayen (eṁ : vedayen Coḍ Eḍ) nātra sandehaṁ pātayet parvatāny api k *sakr̥tsaṁ krāmayogena (Coḍ : cakrāt saṅkrāmayogena Eḍ) *chinnam ¯ula (Eḍ : chinnam ¯ulam Coḍ) iva drumaḥk patanti dehinaḥsarve; 10.25ab, Eḍ 10.25ab: sa viddhaḥ patate bh ¯umau *vajrāghātād ivācalaḥ(eṁ : vajrāghātam ivācalam Coḍ Eḍ).

318 The inducing of possession in persons so that they may be used as oracles, is not restricted in Tantric Buddhism to the context of initiatioṇ It is also seen as an independent procedure in which the medium is a young boy or girl. We find it in the Tantra Subāhuparipr̥cchā in a section partly translated and partly paraphrased from the Chinese by STRICKMANN (1996, pp. 222–226), a work that was translated 

[[136]]

into Chinese (T. 895) by Subh ´ akarasim ¯ . ha in 726 and was in the hands of the Chinese monk Wu-xing in 674 (HODGE 2003, p. 18). We also see it in the Su ji li yan mo xi shou luo dian shuo jia lu luo a wei she fa ‘The quickly effective method of possession (āveśaḥ) taught by the god Mahesvara’ (T. 1277). This short scriptural text, whose ´ translation from the Sanskrit is assigned to Bukong (Amoghavajra) and to a date between 746 and 774, claims in its preamble that it is a teaching given by Siva ´ (Mahesvara) to N ´ arāyan ¯ . a on Mt. Gandhamadana in answer to the latter’s request. ¯ It sets forth a procedure to induce the messenger (Duta) of Mahe ¯ svara to possess a ´ young girl aged seven or eight so that he can then use her while she is in this state to answer any questions he has concerning the future. He should have her fast by eating nothing but pure foods for three or seven dayṣThen on an auspicious day he bathes her, anoints her with unguents, gives her clean clothes, puts camphor in her mouth, sits facing East, smears a low wooden platform with sandalwood-paste, has the girl stand on it, scatters flowers in front of her, sets up a vessel of Argha water, takes incense, empowers it seven times with the Mahamudr āmantra, lights ¯ the incense and fumigates the girl’s hands with it, takes a red flower, empowers it, places it in her hands, and passes his hands over her face. Then, with his hand forming a Mudra he touches and thus empowers five parts of his own body and then ¯ with the same Mudra touches the girl’s head, her mouth, his heart, and his navel ¯ visualizing in these the symbols of fire, water, earth, and wind respectively. He then empowers his two legs, visualizes Garuḍ a, puts the armour-Mantra on the girl’s body, and visualizes himself as Mahesvara, three-eyed, with the digit of the moon ´ on his crown, blue-faced, eighteen-armed, and brandishing various weapons, with a snake as his sacred thread, wearing the bleeding hide of an elephant. He then protects her with recitation, empowers flowers, incense, and Argha water with the Mahamudr āmantra, and seals the ten directionṣThen facing the girl the S ādhaka ¯ recites the Mantra of Mahesvara’s D ´ uta. The girl will start to tremble. This reveals ¯ to him that the Duta has entered her̥ He then snaps his fingers and recites the ¯ Mantra. If she does not fall into the possession trance he should recite a further Mantra to incite the Duta to enter her̥ By this means the result is certaiṇ He then ¯ interrogates her about good and bad in the future and is told whatever he wishes to know. This account is based on an oral translation of the Chinese text very kindly provided by my colleague NOTAKE Miyako (Leipzig). A French translation of part of the text, without the visualizations, is given in H ¯ob¯ogirin, p. 7. 

Here too the model is Saiva, as the preamble and content of this text suggest. ´ Putting children into a possession-state is already present in the earliest liter ature of the Saiva Mantram ´ arga, where we find the use of Ks ¯ .atriya and brah min boys for this purpose; see Niśvāsatattvasaṁ hitā f. 82v1–2 (Niśvāsaguhya 10.116–117b): athāveśaṁ kartukā[maḥ] + + kṣatrakumārakam | snāpayitvā tam ekaṁtu śuddhadehaḥsavāsakam k p ¯urvāmukhaṁsthāpayitvā hy udakenāveśayet; f. 112v6 (Niśvāsaguhya 17.30): athāveśaṁ kartukāmo brāhmaṇ akumāra[kam + u]dakena snāpya tenaiva tāḍ yamānamāveśayed vācayā mokṣaḥ. The ritual also appears in narrative literature. The Kathāsaritsāgara (70.55–63) tells a story of an ash-smeared ascetic, a pupil of Suddhak ´īrti, who has mastered many Mantras and claims to have done this with a Kṣatriya boy (56cd: śubhalakṣaṇ amāsādya kaṁcit kṣatrakumārakam), who in his trance revealed the whereabouts of many miraculous herbs and elixirs (57: sa kumāraḥsamāviṣt.aḥ pr̥ṣt.o nānāvidhāṇi me | siddhauṣadhirasakṣetrāṇ y udīryedam athābravīt), and, finally, a palace of the Nagas in a pollen-covered pond in the jungles of the Vindhya mountains, where, ¯ with the help of Vīras, he could obtain a sword that would make him lord of the SiddhaṣThe procedure is referred to there as a svasthāveśaḥ‘a [rite of caus-

the practioner must induce in himself in order to accomplish both his Siddhis and his enlightenment, typically in the compound vajrāveśaḥ‘possession by Vajra’. For example: 

For by means of possession by [Vajra]sattva enlightenment will quickly be at taineḍ319 

. . . 

When he has given rise toāveśaḥin this way whatever form he meditates on as his own will automatically become Buddha in forṁ320 

. . . 

When vajrāveśaḥ has arisen he should visualize the water as an embodiment of the Vajra. Quickly achieving success he will be able to walk on [that] water̥321 . . . 

Once he has generated vajrāveśaḥ, if with concentrated mind he makes a slight clap with his palms in the Vajra¯njali [gesture] he can subject to his control even a ˜ mountaiṇ322 

. . . 

Likewise, by virtue of the practice ofāveśaḥ, if he stretches out [his hands in] the Vajra gesture and strikes together the tips of his fingers he can kill a hundred familieṣ323 

Two other features of this seminal text evidence the influence of S´ akta ¯ Saivisṁ The first is the fact that after teaching the Vajradh ´ atuman ¯ . ḍ ala in its opening section it goes on to teach the Vajraguhyamaṇ ḍ ala, in which the five Tathagatas are replaced by goddesses: Vairocana at the centre by Va- ¯ jradhatv ¯īsvar ´ī and, around her in the four directions, Akṣobhya by Vajravajriṇī, Ratnasambhava by Ratnavajriṇī, Amitayus by Dharmavajrin ¯ .ī, and Amogha siddhi by Karmavajriṇī.324 In the preamble Vajrapan¯ .i makes the following joyous declaration (udānam):325

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

The second is the incorporation of sexual intercourse into the activities of worship as a higher form of practice. This element is not conspicuous because it is not mentioned in the treatments of the principal Maṇ ḍ alas taught in the text and it was therefore easily pushed out of view when this text was propagated in China and thence in Japaṇ It is present nonetheless as an esoteric teach ing reiterated many times throughout the text in the form of passages teaching that the pleasure of sexual union and indeed other sensual delights are a means both of worshipping the Buddha and of attaining Siddhis when combined with meditation on one’s Buddha nature. For example: 

1: If after generating a firm intention to attain enlightenment he meditates on himself as the Buddha and worships himself [as the Buddha] with the pleasure of sexual intercourse he will obtain the joys of the Buddha himself. 

. . . 

2: He will quickly become equal to Vajrasattva if he presents the pleasures of em bracing the body of any [woman] as offerings to the BuddhaṣHe will be become equal to Vajraratna if he presents the pleasures of grasping [her] hair in intensely felt love as offerings to the BuddhaṣHe will become equal to Vajradharma if he presents the exquisite pleasures of kissing while immersed in intense sensual delight as offerings to the BuddhaṣHe will become the equal of Vajrakarma if during his worship he completely offers up to the Buddhas the pleasures of the union of the two sex organṣ

. . . 

3: He will attain success in the Maṇ ḍ ala by means of the union of the two sex or gans while meditating with fully concentrated mind on the meditation state that embodies all thingṣ

. . . 

4: Non-detachment from sensual pleasures: this is the greatest and purest rule of discipline [for an initiate] in the family of the TathagataṣIt may not be trans- ¯ gressed even by the Buddhaṣ

. . . 

5: There is no religious duty purer than [the exercise of] sexual desire, the be stower of all joyṣThis, which brings about Siddhi, is the highest duty in the family of the Tathagataṣ¯ 

. . . 

6: During worship with the four prostrations he will quickly attain Siddhi if when exhausted from the exertion of love-making he offers [to the Buddhas] the plea sure which that love-making arouseḍ

7: He will attain Siddhi if while meditating with in-turned mind on the purity of lust he worships the Buddhas with the drops of his semeṇ326

The Guhyasamāja: copulating deities, sexual initiation rites, and the sacraliza tion of impurity 

In the next phase of the Mantranaya, seen in the Guhyasamāja, also a product of the eighth century, this esoteric eroticism has moved to the fore ground; and this is apparent from the very beginning of the text. For the place where the Buddha is said to have been residing at the time that he revealed this Tantra, which was expected to be stated in the preamble (nidānavākyam) of any scripture claiming to be Buddhist, is not one of the familiar sites of revelation such as Rajagr ¯ .ha, Dhanyakat ¯ .aka, or, as in the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁ graha, the Akaniṣt.ha heaven, but the vaginas of the goddesses Locana, M āmak ¯ī, Pan¯ . ḍ aravasin ¯ī, and Tarā, that is to say, a timeless, unlocated bliss: ¯327 

[I aver that] I once heard the following [teaching]. The Venerable Lord was re siding in the vaginas of the Vajra-women of the body, speech, and mind of all the Tathagatas . . . ¯ 

and this surprising relocation, no doubt provocatively shocking in its time, became standard in the subsequent literature of the Mantranaya, both in texts closely related to the Guhyasamāja and in the next wave of texts, the Yoginītantras, in which the influence of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva tradition became much ´ more intense and pervasive.328

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

In the Guhyasamāja the male deities, now multi-faced and multi-armed in a fusion of Saiva and Buddhist iconography, are represented and visualized cop- ´ ulating with their consorts;329 and both initiation and subsequent practice now involve copulation with a female partner, as in the S´ aktism of the ¯ Saivaṣ´ 330 A further borrowing from the Vidyap¯īt.ha is evident in the introduction of a cru cial element of what that tradition calls ‘non-dualistic practice’ (advaitācāraḥ) and both traditions call ‘practice free of inhibition’ (niḥśaṅkācāraḥ), namely the offering to the deities of such ‘impure’ substances as urine, faeces, semen, and blood, and their sacramental consumptioṇ331

For the full iconog raphy of these pantheons see Niṣpannayogāvalī A, pp. 1–7; B, pp. 1–12. The prin cipal difference between them is that in the Akṣobhyamaṇ ḍ ala only Akṣobhya, the central deity (cakreśvaraḥ) and the ten wrathful Krodharajas that form the outer ¯ protective circle are represented embracing consorts (sasvābhapraj ñāḥ), whereas 

in the Manjuvajraman ˜ . ḍ ala this is also the case with the four Tathagatas (Vairo- ¯ cana, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, and Amoghasiddhi) that occupy the four direc- ¯ tions around the central deity. All the deities in both Maṇ ḍ alas are three-faced and six-armed and all except the Krodharajas, who stand in the aggressive Praty ālid ¯ .ha posture, are seated in the Vajraparyanka posture. None of the deities has any of the ˙ Kapālika attributes that mark the iconography of the Yogin ¯ītantras, namely the skull-bowl, skull-staff, bone-ornaments, and coating of asḥ 

330 The Guhyasamāja proper (chapters 1–17) gives little detail in its account of initia tion and makes no mention of the involvement of a consort, speaking of the neces sity of acquiring such a partner only in the context of the post-initiatory practice known as the vidyāvratam; see 16.93: ṣoḍ aśābdikāṁ gr̥hya sarvālaṅkārabh ¯uṣitām | cāruvaktrāṁ viśālākṣīṁ prāpya vidyāvrataṁcaret ‘After obtaining a girl of six teen with a charming face and wide eyes, adorned with every adornment, he should practice the Vidyavrata [with her]’. The supplementary 18th chapter, however, the ¯ Samājottara, gives an account of the initiation involving copulation in its vv. 113– 127. 

331 See, e.g., Guhyasamāja 4.21: viṇ m ¯utraśukraraktādīn devatānāṁ nivedayet | evaṁ tuṣyanti saṁ buddhā bodhisattvā mahāśayāḥ‘He should offer to the deities such things as urine, faeces, semen, and blooḍ In this way the noble Buddhas [and] Bodhisattvas are gratified’ (cf. the following in the Guhyasamāja’s satellite Tantra Vajrahr̥dayālaṁ kāra, Pat.ala 3 [rDo rje snying po rgyan gyi rgyud f. 39v3–4]: bshang gci khu ba khrag rnams ni | dung chen po ru bzhag byas te | lha rnams la ni dbul bar bya ‘He should place faeces, urine, semen, and blood in a human skull [mahāśaṅkhe] and offer them to the deities’); 6.21: viṇ m ¯utrāhārakr̥tyārthaṁ kuryāt siddhiphalā rthinaḥ| sidhyate ’nuttaraṁtattvaṁ bodhicittam anāvilam ‘If he desires to attain Siddhi he should consume faeces and urine.

[[143]]Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

That Tantric Buddhists possessed the specialized knowledge of the Saiva ´ Mantramarga that would enable them to draw at will on the ¯ Saiva Tantras in ´ this period is placed beyond doubt by an early exegetical work in the tradition of the Guhyasamāja. For this, the Guhyasiddhi of Padmavajra, written in all probability in the eighth century,332 assumes that any initiate in the practice of this Tantra is not only familiar with the Saiva scriptures but is able to enact ´ their rituals by assuming the role of a Saiva Guru, implying thereby that such ´ initiates were typically converts from the Mantramarga with experience both of ¯ its texts and of its practiceṣFor it tells the adept of this tradition that in or der to acquire the female consort required for his post-initiatory observance he should enter the home of a family of untouchables who are observant devotees of Siva, reveal to them one of the Saiddh ´ antika scriptures—the text specifically ¯ mentions the Kālottara and the Niśvāsa—give them Maṇ ḍ ala initiation [follow ing this scripture], and then return to them the dakṣiṇā that they will give him, taking a girl from them in its place:333 

He should wander in other lands, in which he is known nowhere. With firm re solve the Sadhaka should enter among untouchables who are devotees of ¯ Siva ´

332 Portions of the Guhyasiddhi have been quoted in the Caryāmelāpakapradīpa of Aryadeva: ¯ Caryāmelāpakapradīpa, pp. 71–72 (imam evārthaṁ dyotayannāha śrīguhyasiddhau:) = Guhyasiddhi 3.71–81, 17.38; p. 77 = 6.2–3; and p. 97 = 6.45– 49. TOMABECHI (2008, p. 175) has shown that Aryadeva’s work is likely to have ¯ been written in the early years of the ninth century.

I have emended antyajādīnām to antyajātīnām with the support of the Tibetan because the -ādi- is inapposite: in 8.7 the Sadhaka is ¯ told to enter the home of an untouchable (antyajālayaḥ); and in 8.1 he is told that it is an untouchable girl (antyajā) that he is to acquire. I take dharmaṁ siddhāntap ¯urvakaṁin 8.12c to mean ‘dharmaṁ preceded by [the word] siddhānta- ’, i.e. siddhāntadharmaṁ, an example of a not uncommon style of periphrasiṣ

and recognize no other deity as absolute, who are inspired by the Siddhanta, al- ¯ ways attached to [the rituals of] bathing and deity-worship, and dedicated to the doctrines of its scriptures through some slight degree of literacy. After entering among them in the guise of an untouchable votary (caṇ ḍālagaṇ aḥ), he should, while cultivating insight into the highest wisdom, instruct them in the religion of the Siddhanta established in such scriptures as the ¯ Kālottara, or the Niśvāsa;334 and in order to win their trust he should take as his disciples all those who are 

enjoined by the Tantra after [initiating them before] the Initiation Maṇ ḍ ala [of Siva]. Then he should give back to them all the goods and money that they will ´ 

previously have gathered and given him as their offering to their Guru and take [instead] a girl of theirs with a beautiful face and eyeṣAfter acquainting her with the essence of the Mantras and making her adhere to the rules of an initiate that wise one should practice the Vidya observance [with her], after resolving to ¯ become a Buddha.335 

This is indeed troubling evidence for those who may be reluctant to accept that Buddhists would have had the familiarity with Tantric Saivism that my thesis ´ of the development of the Mantranaya presupposeṣ

336 It was translated into Tibetan towards the end of the eighth century or early in the ninth, and Amoghavajra (705–774) names it and provides a brief summary of its teachings in his Jin-gang-ding-jing yu-jia shi-ba-hui zhi-gui, Jap. Kong ¯o-ch¯o gy¯o yuga j ¯uhatte shiiki (T. 869) Key Points of the Eighteen Assemblies of the Yoga of the Vajraśekharas ¯utra; see TOMABECHI 2007, p. 905. He composed this work in Chinese at some time between 746 and and his death in 774, but we can be sure that the text existed in some form, perhaps in an early stage of its development, by c. 740, since his knowledge of it must have been gained between 741 and 746, when he was in Ceylon and perhaps India gathering the Tantric literature whose analysis and translation into Chinese occupied the rest of his life. 

337 It is referred to by Aryadeva as a Mah āyogatantra in his ¯ Caryāmelāpakapradīpa, p. 82: adhunā prapa ñcatācaryā śrīsarvabuddhasamāgamayogaḍākinījālaśaṁ vara mahāyogatantrād avatāryate.

An alternative terminology distinguishes these more esoteric Yogatantras as Yogottaratantras, perhaps origi nally in the meaning ‘Supplementary Tantras (uttaratantrāṇi) of the Yoga [class]’, and refers to the Yoginītantras as Yoganiruttaratantras, giving the ascending series Kriyatantra, Cary ātantra, Yogatantra, Yogottaratantra, and Yoginiruttaratantra; ¯ see, e.g., Ramap āla, ¯ Sekanirdeśapa ñjikā, introducing verse 1, describing his teacher Maitreyanatha (Advayavajra) as an unsurpassed master of all of these: ¯ iha mahā paṇ ḍitāvadh ¯utaśrīmaitreyanāthaḥ kriyācaryāyogayogottarayoganiruttaratantreṣv anuttaraguruḥ; Ratnakara ¯ s´anti, ¯ Muktāvalī, p. 223, on Hevajra 2.8.10: sarvam iti pa ñcavidham: kriyācaryāyoga*yogottarayoganiruttarabhedena (yogottara corr̥ [=Coḍ, f. 45v6] : yogāntara Eḍ); Kan¯ . ha, Yogaratnamālā, p. 156 (on Heva jra 2.8.10): sarvamantranayam iti pa ñcavidhaṁ kriyācaryāyogayogottarayoga niruttarabhedena; Advayavajra, G ¯uḍ hapadā, f. 6r6–7: vajraṁ pa ñcaj ñānātmakaṁ | iha pa ñcaj ñānaśabdena kriyācaryāyogayogottarayoga*niruttarāṇi (eṁ : nirut tarāś ca Coḍ) tantrāṇ y ucyante. I have seen no occurrence in any Indian source of the term *Anuttarayoga, commonly encountered in secondary sourceṣIt is ev idently an incorrect modern translation into Sanskrit of the ambiguous Tibetan rendering of Yoganiruttara (rnal ’byor bla na med). Early authors attest a less developed hierarchy. Vilasavajra, an author of the eighth century (T ¯ RIBE 1994, pp. 9–23) and the Guru of Buddhajn˜anap āda according to Gzhon nu dpal ( ¯ Blue Annals, p. 367), says that he writes his Nāmamantrārthāvalokinī after study ing the Paramit ānaya and the Kriy ā-, Cary ā-, and Yogatantras (A f. 1v1–2: ¯ yo gacaryākriyātantraṁtathā pāramitānayam . . . vilokya), but the last evidently in cludes texts such as the Guhyasamāja, Vajrabhairava, and Sarvabuddhasamāyoga, since he quotes these and other related workṣ*Buddhaguhya (rNam par snang mdzad chen po mngon par byang chub pa’i rgyud chen po’i ’grel, ff. 64v7–65r6) speaks of Kriyatantras, which emphasize external ritual practice ( ¯ phyi’i spyod, bāhyacaryā), giving as examples the Susiddhikara and the Vidyādharapit.aka, and Yogatantras, which emphasize internal meditation (nang gi sbyor, adhyātmayogaḥ), giving the example of the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁ graha, and says that the Mahā vairocanābhisaṁ bodhi, later classified as a Caryatantra, is a Yogatantra in as much ās it emphasizes the practice of Method and Wisdom (thabs dang shes rab gtsor gyur sbyor ba’i rgyud), but may also be referred to as a Kriyatantra or as an Ub- ¯ hayatantra (bya ba’i rgyud dam gnyis ka’i rgyud), that is to say, as a Tantra of both (ubhaya-) classes, because it also teaches external practice for the benefit of those whose commitment is to thiṣIn a parallel treatment in his Piṇ ḍārtha commentary on the Mahāvairocanābhisaṁ bodhi he gives the Vajrapāṇ yabhiṣeka among exam ples of Kriyatantras (see the translation in H ¯ ODGE 2003, p. 449).

use of that tradition’s system of the four types of Mudra (Mah āmudr ā, Samaya- ¯ mudra, Dharmamudr ā, and Karmamudr ā) in S ādhana texts based on this ¯ Tantra, such as the Vajrajvālodayā of Anandagarbha and the ¯ Herukasādhana of Kalyan¯ . agarbha.338 But it initiates a new direction that would be followed in the next and final phase of the Mantranaya’s development, that of the Yoginītantraṣ339 

considered to be a Caryatantra. The terms Kriy ātantra and Yogatantra are seman- ¯ tically coherent, as Buddhaguhya indicateṣBut the choice of the term Caryatantra ¯ (‘Observance Tantra’) for the intermediate class is puzzling. It is conceivable that it was adopted artificially under the influence of the classification of the subject mat ter of the Tantras of the Saiva Mantram ´ arga into ¯ kriyā, caryā, yogaḥ, and j ñānam or vidyā, perhaps with the notion that the fourth corresponds to the Paramit ānaya. ¯ 

338 As far as I am aware, only one other Sadhana text of this Heruka has sur- ¯ vived in Sanskrit. This is the anonymous Herukasādhana of Sādhanamālā 241. Anandagarbha’s, which appears not to have been translated into Tibetan, is much ¯ the most detailed of the three. Apart from these works the only other evidence of this cult in surviving Sanskrit sources of which I am aware is in the eclectic Yoginītantra Saṁ put.odbhava, which in f. 80v5–81v2, in its eighth Kalpa, the Sar vakriyāsamudayakalparāja, includes the Mantras of this Heruka and his retinue of goddesseṣThere is also a chapter in the Abhidhānottara of the Cakrasaṁ vara corpus (B ff. 121v5–129v1: Pat.ala 22) which teaches a hybrid pantheon in which the goddesses of this Heruka’s retinue have been incorporated into that of Heruka and Vajravarāh¯ī, the former taking on the appearance of the Heruka of the Sarvabud dhasamāyoga, being four-faced and eight-armeḍ This poverty of surviving sources in Sanskrit is probably due to the eclipse of this Tantra after the propagation of the later Yoginītantras, both in India and in Tibet. A striking indication of this eclipse is the fact that its Maṇ ḍ ala was not included by Abhayakaragupta in his ¯ Vajrāvalī and Niṣpannayogāvalī in the first quarter of the eleventh century. For the position that the four Mudras are the distinctive fundamentals of the S ādhana system of the ¯ Yogatantras see, e.g., Mkhas Grub rje’s rGyud spyi, pp. 228–248. 

339 It was accordingly classified in the Kanjur (Toḥ 366–367) among the Yogin ¯ītantras (Toḥ 360–441). Likewise, Mkhas grub rje (1385–1438) in his ¯ rGyud spyi, p. 266: bde mchog kye rdor dus ’khor sgyu thod gdan *bzhi (eṁ : gsum Eḍ) phyag chen thig le sangs rgyas mnyam sbyor sogs ma rgyud yin no ‘The Mother Tantras [=Yoginītantras] are such as the Sam´. vara, the Hevajra, the Kālacakra, the [Mahā]māyā, the [Buddha]kapāla, the Catuṣpīt.ha, the Mahāmudrātilaka, and the [Sarva]buddhasamāyoga’. This recognition of the [proto-]Yoginītantric char acter of the text is not only Tibetaṇ It appears in the thirteenth chapter of the D.ākinīvajrapa ñjara, where it is referred to in abbreviated form as the *Sarvabud dha- (Sangs rgyas kun) in a list of Yoginītantras that also includes the Vajraḍāka, Hevajra, Guhyakośa, Vajrāmr̥ta, and Cakrasaṁ vara: rdo rje mkha’ ’gro phan rgyud dang | *kye yi rdo rje (T : kye yi rdo rje dkyil ’khor D) sangs rgyas kun | gsang mdzod rdo rje bdud rtsi ’byung ba dang | ’khor lo sdom pa gur *gyi (T : dang D) ’byung gnas ni | rnal ’byor ma *rgyud ni (T : rgyud drug tu D) rab tu grags (mKha’ ’gro ma’i dra ba’i rdo rje gur rgyud, D f. 104v4–5; T p. 369, ll. 5–6), and in Dīpankara ˙ sr´ījn˜ ana’s ¯ commentary on his Byang chub lam gyi sgron ma’i dka’ ’grel, where he refers to the texts of this class under their alternative title as Yoganiruttaratantras (rnal ’byor bla na med pa’i rgyud), p. 286: rnal ’byor bla na med pa’i rgyud ni dpal nam mkha’ dang mnyam pa ’bum pa chen po ’khor lo sdom pa dang rdo rje mkha’ ’gro dang rdo rje gdan bzhi pa dang ma hā mā yā dang sangs rgyas mnyam sbyor

First, it introduces or brings to the fore the cult of the deity Heruka340 with 

an iconography inspired by that of the Bhairavas of the Vidyap¯īt.ha with their accoutrements and attributes of the cremation-ground dwelling Kapālika ¯ Saiva ´ ascetic. According to the visualization given by Anandagarbha he has four faces ānd eight arms, emerging as the transformation of a dark blue flaming Vajra, it self a transformation of a dark blue syllable HR¯IH.. The central face is fierce (rau

On the term Yoganiruttara see here p. 146. 

340 The origin of the name Heruka has not been explained in a satisfactory manner̥ Indigenous sources explain it only through artificial semantic analyses based on su perficial similarities of sounḍ Thus, for example, we are told that ‘He-’ means ‘un caused’ (hetuvarjitam), ‘-ru-’ means ‘formless’ (ru¯ panirmuktam), and ‘-ka’ means ‘free of sense-faculties’ (karaṇ ojjhitam); see Vajrapan¯ .i, Laghutantrat.īkā, p. 45; Bhavabhat.t.a, Cakrasaṁ varapa ñjikā, p. 5; and the Tibetans, who translated names if they were meaningful, either left this untranslated or substituted a description, namely Khrag ’thung ‘Blood-drinker’, a meaning that cannot be justified etymolog ically. So if the name was meaningful at some stage it appears that that meaning has left no trace in the surviving literature. The alternative is that it never was meaningful in this sense, being created on the basis of the unmeaning syllables HE HE RU RU KAM.that are found in Cakrasaṁ vara’s Mulamantra: ¯ OM. SR´ ¯IVAJRA HE HE RU RU KAM. HUM¯. HUM¯. PHAT. D. AKIN ¯ ¯IJALA ¯ SAM ´. VARAM. SVAH¯ A¯. Against this it may be said that the name appears without this doubling of the first two syllables in the earlier Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁ graha, section 794, in the Mantra for the tam ing of all the Mother goddesses: OM. HERUKA VAJRASAMAYA SARVADUS. T. ASAMAYA MUDRAPRABHA ¯ NJAKA H ˜ UM¯. PHAT.. It might seem more reasonable, then, to see HE HE RU RU KAM. as a spell-element built from an already existing name. However, it is striking that we find almost the same element in the Vidya of Par āpārā, an im- ¯ portant Mantra of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva Vidy ´ ap¯īt.ha: OM. AGHORE HR¯IH. PARAMAGHORE HUM. GHORARUPE HAH ¯. GHORAMUKHI BH¯IMA BH¯IS. AN. E VAMA PIBA HE RU RU RA RA PHAT. HUM. HAH. PHAT.(Siddhayogeśvarīmata 3.23–39; Mālinīvijayottara 3.42– 50; Tantrāloka 30.20–24b; Triśirobhairava quoted by Jayaratha thereon) and its variant taught in Kubjikāmata 18.4-24: AIM. AGHORE HR¯IM. HSAH. PARAMAGHORE HUM¯. GHORARUPE HSAUM ¯. GHORAMUKHI BH¯IMA BH¯IS. AN. E VAMA VAMA PIBA HAH. HE RU RU RA RA HR¯IM. HUM¯. PHAT.. We may note that the name Hevajra, that of the second major deity of the Yoginītantras, appears to have a similar origin, having been conjured up from the Mantra HE VAJRA PASYA ´ ‘O Vajra[-being], behold!’ that is uttered when the blindfold is removed from the candidate’s eyes in the presence of the Maṇ ḍ ala (Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁ graha, section 230). The origin of the Herukas Rigi-arali and Vajra- ārali of the Tantras of those names are also, it seems, ¯ the apparently unmeaning syllables of Mantras: OM. ARALI RIGI PHEM ¯. PHEM. PHEM. BHYO SVAH¯ A¯ (Ri giā ra li’i rgyud f. 187v2) and OM. VAJRA ARALI PHAT ¯.. . . PHEM. PHEM. SVAH¯ A¯ (Ri giā ra li’i rgyud f. 187v7). The name of the Heruka Buddhakapala ¯ of the Tantra of that name has likewise been conjured out of the feminine vocative BUDDHAKAPALINI ¯ /-KAP¯ ALINI ¯ that appears in its Mantras; see (Niṣpannayogāvalī, p. 31: OM. BUDDHAKAPALINI ¯ AH¯. H¯I HAI HUM¯. PHAT.; Buddhakapālatantra, e.g., f. 5r1: OM. BUDDHAKAP¯ ALIN ¯ ¯I MAT. A 2 AH¯. PHAT. SVAH¯ A¯ puṣpanivedanamantraḥ).

tathāgattattvasaṁ graha,350 is very much in the Kapālika style of the pantheons ¯ of Bhairavas and Yoginīs taught in the Vidyap¯īt.ha. 

Second, it is in the tradition of this Tantra that we see for the first time in the Mantranaya the practice of the gaṇ amaṇ ḍ alam, orgiastic worship in an assembly consisting of a male and a group of female adepts (yoginīgaṇ aḥ) person ifying the deities of the cult, with a jargon of special terms and gestures known as chommāḥto be used in these gatheringṣ351 Both these features, collective orgiastic worship of deity-personifying Yoginīs and the use of chommāḥ, are dis tinctive features of the S´ akta ¯ Saivism of the Vidy ´ ap¯īt.ha.352 

Third, we see here for the first time the complete abandoning of the mixed prose and verse style inherited from the Mahayānas ¯ utras in favour of one that ¯ resembles that of the Saiva scriptures in consisting entirely of Anus ´.t.ubh verse, barring the Mantras, and also the disappearance of the traditional Buddhist preamble maintained up to the time of the Guhyasamāja, stating the occasion and place of the revelatioṇ353 It is also in the Sarvakalpasamuccaya, the supple 

350 See Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁ graha, sections 165–176 and Niṣpannayogāvalī, p. 46 (Vajradhupā, Vajrapus ¯ .pa, Vajr ālok ā, and Vajragandh ā). ¯ 

351 The practice and the jargon are outlined by Aryadeva in his ¯ Caryāmelāpakapradīpa (pp. 82–60: prapa ñcatācaryā) on the authority of this Tantra. The Yoginīs per sonified here are the twenty that form the retinue of Vajrasattva, the eight pecu liar to him being Sam´. varī, Ahosukha, Prad ¯īpa, ¯ Sis ´.ya, Buddhabodhi, Dharmacakr ā,¯ Trailokya, and K āmalat ā.¯ 

352 On such worship in S´ akta ¯ Saivism see S ´ ANDERSON 2007a, pp. 280–288; and Tantrāloka 28.6–111, 372c–385b (yoginīmelakaḥ, cakrayāgaḥ, m ¯urtiyāgaḥ), 29.66, 78–79. On chommāḥin these traditions see SANDERSON 2007a, p. 333 and the sources quoted in footnotes 331–332. 

353 The Tantra begins as follows (Sangs rgyas thams cad mnyam par sbyor ba, f. 151r1–2: 1.1 sems dpa’ sangs rgyas kun gyi dngos | rdo rje sems dpa’ bde ba’i mchog | gsang ba mchog gi dgyes pa na | thams cad bdag nyid rtag tu gzhugs | 1.2 ’di ni rang byung bcos ldan ’das | gcig bu rab tu phye ba’i lha | sangs rgyas thams cad mnyam sbyor ba | mkha’ ’gro sgyu ma bde ba’i mchog (*rahasye parame ramye sarvātmani sadā sthitaḥ| sarvabuddhamayaḥsattvo vajrasattvaḥ paraṁsukham k asau svayambh ¯ur bhagavān eka evādhidaivataḥk sarvabuddhasamāyogaḍākinījālaśaṁ varaḥ). Cf. the opening verses of the Laghu- śaṁ varatantra, which are evidently based on it: athāto rahasyaṁ vakṣye samāsān na tu vistarāt | śrīherukasaṁ yogaṁsarvakāmārthasādhakam k 1.2 uttarād api cottaraṁ ḍākinījālaśaṁ varam | rahasye parame ramye sarvātmani sadā sthitaḥ k 1.3 sarvaḍākinīmayaḥsattvo vajrasattvaḥ paraṁsukham | asau hi svayambh ¯ur bhagavān vīro ḍākinījālaśaṁ varam; and the following citation of the Sarvabuddha samāyoga in the Caryāmelāpakapradīpa, p. 82: athātaḥsampravakṣyāmi sarvato viśvam uttamam | sarvabuddhasamāyogaṁ ḍākinījālaśaṁ varam k rahasye parame ramye sarvātmani sadā sthitaḥ| sarvabuddhamayaḥśrīmān vajrasattvodayaḥ sukhaḥ. These verses are 1–2 of the Kalpa 6 of the Tantra, corresponding to the Tibetan, except that that seems to have had a different version of the first line (f. 159v4–5): de nas gzhan yang thams cad du | rnam pa sna tshogs mchog ’byung pa’i | sangs rgyas thams cad mnyam sbyor ba | mkha’ ’gro sgyu ma’i

mentary continuation (uttaratantra) of this Tantra, that we see the first appear ance in the Mantranaya of the Saiva method of teaching Mantras in encrypted ´ 

form to be decoded by the process known as mantroddhāraḥ; and with this devel opment we encounter what is at present our earliest evidence of Buddhist-Saiva ´ 

intertextuality. A passage of seven verses that prescribes for this purpose the drawing of a square with forty-nine cells (koṣt.hakāni) and the arranging of the forty-nine letters within them corresponds very closely to one in the Vīṇāśikha of the vāmasrotaḥ division of the Vidyap¯īt.ha.354 

The intensification of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva character of the Mantranaya evident ´ in this text is accompanied by the implication that this Buddhism is one that has conquered that tradition, transforming it, as it were, from within into a ve hicle for Buddhist salvatioṇ For while wrathful Heruka appears with Kapālika ¯ iconography and a retinue of Yoginīs he wears, as we have seen, the freshly flayed skin of Bhairava over his shoulders; and the Tantra relates that its deity in its commitment to purify all beings has violently overpowered Siva, Vis ´.ṇ u, Brahma, ānd Kamadeva, and taken their consorts by force for his own enjoyment. ¯355 This 

bde mchog bshaḍ For the requirement of a preamble see, e.g., the Mahayānist ¯ Dharmasaṁ gītis ¯utra as quoted by Abhayakaragupta in the introduction to his ¯ Ab hayapaddhati f. 1v: kāladeśadeśakaparṣatsāmagrī hi deśanāyā nidānam enāṁ vinā deśanānupapatteḥ. tatra evaṁ mayeti mama dharmaḥsaṁ gātavyaḥ. . . ity uktaṁ bhagavatā dharmasaṁ gītis ¯utre ‘For the preamble that establishes the au thenticity of a teaching [comprises] all these factors together, namely the time, place, teacher, and congregation, because without all those it cannot be [accepted as] a teaching. To this effect the Buddha has declared in the Dharmasaṁ gītis ¯utra . . . : ‘My teachings must be recited with [the opening phrase] “Thus I [. . . ]”’; and the unnamed S ¯utra quoted by Tathagataraks ¯ .ita on Yoginīsaṁcāra 1.1: mayi parinirvr̥te bhikṣava evaṁ mayetyādikayā mama dharmaḥsaṁ gātavyaḥ‘O monks, after I have been completely extinguished [by death] you should recite my teachings with the words “Thus I . . . ”’. 

354 This has been demonstrated in TOMABECHI 2007. The Saiva passage is ´ Vīṇāśikha 52–58. That in the Sarvakalpasamuccaya is DK, Rgyud ’bum, vol. ka, ff. 194v6– 195r5.

rhetoric of appropriation is reflected in the Mantras of Heruka’s Vajraḍ akin ¯īṣPramoha, who, as we have seen, has the boar face of Vis ¯ .ṇ u’s Adivar āha incarna- ¯ tion, is invoked as Vajranarāyan ¯ .ī, Caurī as Vajracaṇ ḍ esvar ´ī, and Ghasmarī as Vajramahe ¯ svar ´ī.356 Furthermore, Heruka’s first appearance in the Mantranaya 

is in the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁ graha, where his name appears in a Mantra for the drawing of all the [Saiva] Mother-goddesses into Buddhism, and it is ´ 

that, with the insertion of a single seed syllable, that is adopted as the Mantra of Heruka in the Sarvabuddhasamāyogaḍākinījālaśaṁ vara.357 The very title of the work alludes to this assimilation, since it is evidently calqued on those of two Vidyap¯īt.ha scriptures, the Sarvavīrasamāyoga and the Yoginījālaśaṁ vara.358

There are other examples of the assimilative transformation of non-Buddhist deities in the Mantranaya, marked, as here, by the prefixing of Vajra- to their nameṣFor example, the deities Vajranarāyan ¯ . a, [Vajra]caṇ ḍīsvara, ´ and Vajrapadmodbhava, that is to say, Vajrayanist transformations of Vis ¯ .ṇ u, Rudra, and Brahma, together with their consorts Vajra ¯ sr´ī, Vajragaurī, and Vajratarā, join ¯ Akā¯sagarbha and Khavajrin ´ .ī to form the retinue of Vajrasattva in the central sec tion of the abridged Maṇ ḍ ala (bsdus pa’i dkyil ’khor) of the Yogatantra Paramādya, a text with which the Sarvabuddhasamāyoga is closely related (TOMABECHI 2007, p. 904; TANAKA 1996, pp. 271–272). That disposition of deities is taught (see TANAKA 1996, pp. 96–103) in the mChog dang po’i sngags kyi rtog pa’i dum bu (*Srīparamādyamantrakalpakhan ´. ḍ a) (Toḥ 488) according to ¯ Anandagarbha’s ¯ mChog dang po’i rgya cher bshad pa (*Paramādyat.īkā) (Toḥ 2512). ¯

358 On these two scriptures see SANDERSON 2007a, pp. 234–236 and footnotes 21– 22. The expression sarvavīrasamāyogaḍākinījālaśaṁ varam, without the substi tution of -buddha- for -vīra-, is seen in the Yoginītantras of Cakrasaṁ vara. It ap pears in, e.g., Laghuśaṁ varatantra, f. 8r3 (8.1) and f. 24v4 (31.13ef): tataḥsarva vīrasamāyogaḍākinījālaśaṁ varam; and Saṁ varodaya 3.6cd: sarvavīrasamāyoga ḍākinījālasatsukhaṁ In the last satsukham is a tacit semantic analysis of śaṁ varaḥ. 

[[156]]

Laghuśaṁ vara also called Cakrasaṁ vara and Herukābhidhāna, the Heva jra, the Catuṣpīt.ha, the Vajrāmr̥ta, the Buddhakapāla, the Mahāmāyā, the Rigyārali, the Vajrārali, the Caṇ ḍ amahāroṣaṇ a, and the Kālacakra. Two of these texts, the Laghuśaṁ vara of the Heruka called Sam ´. vara (bDe mchog) or Cakrasaṁ vara (’Khor lo sdom pa) and the Hevajra of the Heruka Hevajra held centre-stage, a position they later shared with the Kālacakra when that text was propagated towards the end of the tenth century, during the reign of Mahīpala I (r̥ ¯ c. 977–1027).359 Their importance is reflected in the shere quantity of commentaries and other texts devoted to the cult of their deitieṣThe Tenjur contains translations of eleven commentaries on the Hevajra and of eleven on the Laghuśaṁ vara, and of about two hundred other explanatory texts related to eacḥ Moreover, they both have a number of satellite Tantras, the Hevajra five and the Laghuśaṁ vara over fifty.360 The principal among these, those that received commentaries, are for the Hevajra the D.ākinīvajrapa ñjara and the Mahāmudrātilaka, and for the Laghuśaṁ vara the Herukābhyudaya, the Vajraḍāka, the Abhidhānottara, the Yoginīsaṁcāra, the Saṁ varodaya, and the D.ākārṇ ava. Another major Yoginītantra, the Saṁ put.odbhava, on which we have an important commentary, the Amnāyama ñjarī ¯, by Abhayakaragupta ¯ (1064–1125),361 pertains to both cycleṣ362 

359 On the date of the Kālacakra see here p. 96. On the establishing of this tradition and how it positioned itself in relation to earlier Tantric Buddhism see SFERRA 2005. 

360 This large total includes thirty-four texts (Toḥ 383–416), forming a supplementary ¯ collection, as it were, of related opera minora, totalling less than 150 pageṣThough included in the Kanjur they were classified by Bu ston (1290–1364) as supplemen tary Tantras whose authenticity, that is to say, Indian origin, was the subject of debate (rgyud yang dag yin min rtsod pa can). The great majority are claimed in their colophons to be translations prepared in the early eleventh century by ’Brog mi in collaboration with the Indian Gayadhara. On the lay Tantric Gayadhara, who is mentioned in no Indian source known to me but is the subject of many partly conflicting accounts in Tibet, where he was venerated as the Indian source of the Lam ’bras tradition and for having collaborated with several Tibetan translators, see STEARNS 2001, pp. 47–55. It is, however, certain that not all these opera mi nora are of suspect authenticity. For my pupil Peter-D ´ aniel Sz ´ ant ´ o has recently ´ identified the original Sanskrit of one, the Anāvilatantra, among the contents of a palm-leaf codex preserved in the Tokyo University Library (verbal communication). 

361 These dates rest on Tibetan tradition and are consistent with the regnal years of Ramap āla that Abhay ākaragupta has reported as the dates of composition at the ¯ end of some of his works; see here p. 126. 

362 Thus, though counted as an explanatory Tantra of the Cakrasaṁ vara cycle, it is grouped with the Hevajra and D.ākinīvajrapa ñjara as one of the three Tantras of Hevajra (kye rdo rje rgyud gsum) in the Sa skya tradition of Tibet, and classified because of its mixed character as the Hevajra’s shared explanatory Tantra (thun mong bshad rgyud); see STEARNS 2001, pp. 173–174, ṇ 28. It also extends into the territories of the Catuṣpīt.ha, the Guhyasamāja, the Vajrabhairava, and, as we

CHRONOLOGY AND PROVENANCE. All of these Tantras were translated into Tibetan, and all but the latest among them, the D.ākārṇ ava and the Saṁ varodya, were translated in the first half of the eleventh century, during the opening phase of the later diffusion (phyi dar) of Indian Buddhism to Tibet, as were commen taries on the majority of those named here, most written during the course of the tenth and early eleventh centurieṣ

The oldest is probably the commentary of Jayabhadra on the Laghuśaṁ vara. In chapter 38 of his Rgya gar chos ’byung Taran ātha includes five of our com- ¯ mentators on the Laghuśaṁ vara, Jayabhadra, Bhavabhadra/Bhavabhat.t.a, Bhavyakīrti, Durjayacandra, and Tathagataraks ¯ .ita, among ten persons whom he holds to have occupied the office of chief Vajracārya at Vikrama ¯ s´īla in rapid unbroken succession, and claims that Jayabhadra was the first of the ten (Jayabhadra, Sr´īdhara, Bhavabhadra (/Bhavabhat.t.a), Bhavyakīrti, Līlavajra, ¯ Durjayacandra, Kr̥ṣṇ asamayavajra, Tathagataraks ¯ .ita, Bodhibhadra, and Kamalarakṣita). Moreover, comparison of the commentaries, the Tibetan trans lation, and the only manuscript of the Laghuśaṁ vara accessible to me at present reveals two versions of the text. Taran ātha’s claim that Jayabhadra preceded all ¯ the other commentators in his list gains support from the fact that Jayabhadra knew what is evidently the earlier of these two versionṣIt extends only to 50.19, ending with a passage on fire-sacrifices that may be performed if one wishes to subject another to one’s will (vaśyahomaḥ). In the second, attested by all the other commentators except Bhavyakīrti,363 by the Tibetan translation, and by 

have seen, the Sarvabuddhasamāyogaḍākinījālaśaṁ vara. 

363 In Bhavyakīrti’s Cakrasaṁ varapa ñjikā the text of the Laghuśaṁ vara ends exactly where it does in Jayabhadra’ṣIt is therefore likely to belong like Jayabhadra’s to the earliest phase of the exegesis of this Tantra. Jayabhadra’s appears to be the older of the two. In 41.8 Bhavyakīrti attests with the later witnesses the interpo lation (see here p.199) *oḍ ḍiyānajālandharapullīramalayādiṣu (bDe mchog nyung ngu, f. 239r2: au ḍ ya na | dzā la ndha ra dang pu li ra ma la ya sogs), since he comments here (f. 36v6): o ḍ yā na du ni ’od ldan ma’o | dzā la ndha rar ni gtum mig ma’o | pu llī ra ma la ya la sogs, whereas Jayabhadra says that Pullīramalaya has not been mentioned but must nonetheless be understood to be intended (p. 137: pullīramalayo na nirdiṣt.aḥsarvapīt.hānāṁ pradhānatvād upadeśād vāvaseyaḥ). It seems probable, then, that Bhavyakīrti follows the reading of a subsequent redac tion in which this ‘omission’ had been rectifieḍ 

At the beginning of the translation the name of Bhavyakīrti’s commentary is said to be S ¯uramanoj ñā ´in Sanskrit and dpa’ bo’i yid du ’ong in Tibetan, i.e. ‘pleasing to heroes’. But the Sanskrit titles given in the Tenjur are so often inaccurate that we can conclude that they do not reach us from the Sanskrit works themselves but are reconstructions from the Tibetan added by the compilers of the Tenjur̥ The Sanskrit rendered by dPa’ bo’i yid du ’ong can now only be guessed, but its first element was surely Vīra- rather than S ¯ura- ´. The Mahāvyutpatti, composed to guide Tibetan translators and no doubt the dictionary used by the compilers of the Tenjur, gives dpa’ bo to render both vīra- and ś ¯ura-, both meaning ‘hero’; but though the two 

[[158]]

the manuscript, the fiftieth chapter has eight verses after the last of the shorter text (50.20–27), followed by a fifty-first chapter of twenty-two verseṣIt is clear that the longer text is the later̥ For the alternative, that the shorter text arose after the longer by excision of the final thirty verses, is inconceivable, since these have the effect of greatly increasing the plausibility of the whole as a Buddhist work and were no doubt added because it was felt, quite rightly, that 1.1 to 50.19 were inadequate in this regarḍ The only element of Mahayāna Buddhist ¯ doctrine contained in the text up to 50.19 comprises a section of four verses (10.1–4) stating that success in the pursuit of Siddhis depends on the Sadhaka’s ¯ identifying with the three Buddha bodies (Dharmakaya, Sam ¯ . bhogakaya, and ¯ Nirman¯ . akaya), all other Buddhist elements being little more than a handful of ¯ occurrences of the terms Buddha, Tathagata, and Bodhisattva, and the names ¯ of Vajrayanist deitieṣ¯ 

Now Taran ātha claims that his ten successive Tantric ¯ Acāryas of ¯ Vikramas´īla held their positions after the time of Buddhajn˜anap āda and ¯ Dīpankarabhadra, whom he places in the reign of Dharmap ˙ ala ( ¯ c. 775–812); and he reports that each did so for twelve years, implying thereby a form of limited tenure. Thereafter, he says, came the six “Door-keepers”. Among them was Ratnakara ¯ s´anti, who taught the Tibetan translator ’Brog mi ¯ S´ akya ye ¯ shes (993–1077?)364 and the Indian Dīpankara ˙ sr´ījn˜ana ¯365 (982–1054), and was a slightly older contemporary of Jn˜ana ¯ sr´īmitra, who was active c. 980–1030. From this it would be a simple matter to determine the approximate date of Jayabhadra, the first of the ten, by counting the years from either end, were it not that Taran ātha makes the collective tenure of the ten ¯ Acāryas 120 years, ¯ whereas the interval between Dīpankarabhadra and Ratn ˙ akara ¯ s´anti is almost ¯ two centurieṣWe might be inclined to count back from Ratnakara ¯ s´anti rather ¯ than forward from Dīpankarabhadra, thinking that a historian’s information ˙ is likely to be more reliable the closer he approaches his own time. In that case, if we trust Taran ātha and set the end of the tenure of Kamalaraks ¯ .ita in 1000, as the immediate predecessor of the Door-keepers, we will conclude that Jayabhadra’s tenure ran from 880–892. 

words are synonymous in ordinary usage, in the tradition of the Yoginītantras it is the former alone that is used in the special sense evidently intended here, that is, as a technical term for the Tantric practitioner̥ As for the second element, the same dictionary gives manoj ña- for yid du ’ong. But the result is unattractive by the standards of Sanskrit authors, who generally sought, like authors everywhere, to give their works titles that appealed to the ear̥ Vīramanoramā is synonymous and meets this requirement.

However, this chronology can be reconciled with other reports only at a great stretch, at least for the later teachers in Taran ātha’s successioṇ Thus Dmar ¯ ston, pupil of Sa skya Paṇ ḍita Kun dga’ rgyal mtshan (1182–1251) tells us366 that Durjayacandra, who by this calculation would have held office from 940 to 952, was the teacher of Prajnendraruci, also called V ˜īravajra, and that the latter taught ’Brog mi S´ akya ye sheṣNow ’Brog mi is said to have let Tibet ¯ for Nepal and India when Rin chen bzang po was nearly fifty years old,367 that is to say around 1007 if Rin chen bzang po was born in 958, as his biography claims and Gzhon nu dpal accepts,368 and then, after spending one year in Nepal with S´ antibhadra ¯369 and eight at Vikramas´īla with Ratnakara ¯ s´anti, ¯370 to have studied with Prajnendraruci for three or four, ˜371 that is to say, therefore, c. 1016– 1020. If we accept that Durjayacandra is unlikely to have held such a senior post as that of the head Vajracārya of Vikrama ¯ s´īla in his youth and assume for the sake of argument that he was fifty-five when he began his tenure, then if that tenure began in 940, he would have to have been continuing to teach long after his retirement at sixty-seven in 952, and Prajnendraruci, if we take 945 as ˜ the latest plausible year of his birth, would have been about seventy when he accepted ’Brog mi as his pupil. 

This scenario is not impossible; but neither is it comfortable. Nor is it helped by the fact that Prajnendraruci is reported to have collaborated with ’Brog mi ˜ on translations of texts pertaining to Hevajra and his consort Nairatmy ā. This ¯ evidence is given in the colophons at the end of these translations372 and should be considered more reliable than that of hagiographical biographieṣ

Even more difficult to reconcile is the report in the Chos ’byung of Pad ma dkar po (1527–1592) that Durjayacandra taught the Mantranaya at Vikramas´īla to the translator Rin chen bzang po.373 For Rin chen bzang po is said to have left for India in 975, at the age of seventeen, and to have gone to Vikramas´īla only after a period of some seven years of education in Kashmir, therefore around 982. At that time Durjayacandra would have been nearly a hundred if we hold to the assumption that he began his tenure in 940 when he was fifty-five years of age.374 It is probable, then, that while we are indeed closer to the truth if

we calculate back from the Door-keepers than forward from Buddhajn˜ana and ¯ Dīpankarabhadra, T ˙ aran ātha has placed the later teachers from Durjayacandra ¯ onwards too early. 

This suspicion gains further support from what we know of the life of Tathagataraks ¯ .ita. If Taran ātha’s report were accurate, provided that we ¯ calculate backwards from the six Door-keepers, then he would have held office at Vikramas´īla c. 964–976. But we learn from the colophon of the Tibetan translation of his commentary on the Yoginīsaṁcāra that he translated the work himself with the help of the Tibetan Ba ri Lo tsa ba Rin chen gragṣThis places ¯ his activity well into the second half of the eleventh century. For Ba ri Rin chen grags is said by Gzhon nu dpal to have been born in 1040.375 

If Durjayacandra, as now seems probable, was active towards the end of the tenth century, and if Taran ātha is correct that there were no intervals ¯ between the tenures of his predecessors Jayabhadra, Sr´īdhara, Bhavabhadra, Bhavyakīrti, and Līlavajra, then we shall not be far from the truth if we assign ¯ them all these commentators on the Laghuśaṁ vara to the tenth century. 

Beyond the terminus provided by this tentative dating of the earliest commentators we have no clear knowledge of the date of these TantraṣIt has been claimed by DAVIDSON that the Laghuśaṁ vara was already in ex istence in the eighth century since Vilasavajra cites it several times in his ¯ commentary on the Ma ñjuśrīnāmasaṁ gīti;376 and this view has recently been repeated by GRAY.377 The latter recognized that most of the former’s claimed 

citations are actually not of the Laghuśaṁ varatantra but of the Sarvabud dhasamāyogaḍākinījālaśaṁ vara, which Vilasavajra cites as the ¯ Sam´. varatantra, using the common abbreviation of this unwieldy title. But he argues that the date is established nonetheless by two places in the same commentary in which Vilasavajra cites a ¯ Cakrasaṁ varatantra or Cakraśaṁ varatantra. This GRAY takes to be the Laghuśaṁ vara under its commonly used aliaṣBoth citations occur in a section of the commentary in which, explaining epithets found in the Ma ñjuśrīnāmasaṁ gīti, Vilasavajra follows each with ¯ iti and the name of a Tantra in the locative, indicating that the epithet is also found in that source. The first citation, GRAY claims, is of Laghuśaṁ vara 2.16c (f. 2v6: hasticarmāvaruddhaṁca ‘and [his back] covered with the hide of an elephant’), and the second of 48.12a (f. 35r6: kaṅkāla mahākaṅkāla). In fact the first passage does not cite Laghuśaṁ vara 2.16c, the text quoted being gajacarmapat.ārdradhr̥ k ‘wearing as his upper garment the moist hide of an

elephant’, to which Laghuśaṁ vara 2.16c corresponds only in sense and then not exactly.378 As for the second citation,379 the word kaṅkālaḥ does appear in the Laghuśaṁ vara, as the name of one of the twenty-four Vīra consorts of the twenty-four D. akin ¯īs,380 but as a single word its presence is not enough to es tablish the identity of Vilasavajra’s ¯ Cakrasaṁ vara with the Laghuśaṁ vara. On the other hand, the fact that the first epithet attributed to the Cakrasaṁ vara does not occur in the Laghuśaṁ vara is not sufficient to prove the opposing thesis, that Vilasavajra was referring to another work. For it is conceivable ¯ that he was citing the text not for the exact wording of Ma ñjuśrīnāmasaṁ gīti 69d (gajacarmapat.ārdradhr̥ k) but only for an expression close to it in meaning. But if this is true it establishes, of course, only that Vilasavajra may have been ¯ referring to Laghuśaṁ vara 2.16c, not that he waṣTo continue to hold to the position that Vilasavajra must have been referring to our ¯ Laghuśaṁ vara in spite of these considerations, one has to put one’s trust in the fact that the Laghuśaṁ vara is also known as the Cakrasaṁ vara and the fact that no other work of this name is cited (unless it be here). One must also remain free of the suspicion that there might have been another, earlier work with this title among the numerous Tantras known in the eighth century that have failed to survive either in Sanskrit or in Tibetan translatioṇ381 One must also overlook the evidence of the Laghuśaṁ vara itself. For that refers to a Cakrasaṁ vara in a list of its own predecessorṣ382 I conclude, therefore, that there is no more than

a possibility that Vilasavajra knew the ¯ Laghuśaṁ vara and, therefore, that the existence of this Tantra in the eighth century remains unproveḍ What we can say with confidence is that the Laghuśaṁ vara came af ter the Paramādya, the Vajrabhairava, the Sarvatathāgatasaṁ graha, the Guhyasamāja, and the Sarvabuddhasamāyogaḍākinījālaśaṁ vara, since it names these,383 and tacitly incorporates verses from the last three in its earliest accessible redactioṇ384 These borrowings do not rule out the possibility that the

The Sam´. vara here is the Sarva buddhasamāyogaḍākinījālaśaṁ vara. The title is commonly so abbreviated; see also Indrabhuti’s comment on the first passage ( ¯ ’Khor lo sdom pa’i rgyud kyi rgyal po bde mchog bsdus pa zhes bya ba’i rnam par bshad, f. 38r7): bde mchog ni sgyu ma bde mchog go ‘The Sam´. vara is the Jālaśaṁ vara’.

In his Cakrasaṁ varat.īkā Devagupta takes it to be “the Guhyasamāja etc.” (f. 80r5): bsdus pa la sogs par̥ But in his Cakrasaṁ varapa ñjikā Bhavabhat.t.a glosses guhyatantre in 27.23 as guhyakośādau ‘in the Guhyakośa etc.’.

Laghuśaṁ vara was composed in that century, since none of the works is later than that time. But three considerations suggest a later date. (1) No text of the Cakrasaṁ vara corpus, or any other Yoginītantra, was translated into Tibetan during the earlier diffusion of Buddhism (snga dar) that occurred from the eighth century to the middle of the ninth, during Tibet’s imperial period: this new literature reached the Tibetans only during the later transmission (phyi dar), that began c. 1000. (2) Among the many surviving stone, metalwork, and painted Indian images of Sam ´. vara none is demonstrably earlier than the tenth century.385 Finally (3), there is, as we have seen, no evidence of commentatorial work on the Laghuśaṁ vara before c. 900. Of course, none of these facts proves conclusively that the Laghuśaṁ vara was not in existence at an earlier date. But they do incline one to consider a later date more probable. This is particularly so in the case of the absence of commentarieṣThe Laghuśaṁ vara is so problematic text from the Buddhist point of view that it is hard to imagine that it could have survived for long without the support of learned exegesiṣ

Whatever its date, the Laghuśaṁ vara is likely to be a product of the first phase of the development of the Yoginītantras, if not the earliest of them all. This surmise rests on the assumption that Yoginītantras that are less sophis ticated in the sense that they show a less developed Mahayāna Buddhist theo- ¯

385 A Kashmirian Sam ´. vara of leaded brass inlaid with copper and silver in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from the Nasli and Alice Heeramaneck Collection appears to have been assigned by PAL to c. 725 in his catalogue of the exhibition ‘The Arts of Kashmir’ (2007, p. 91, fig. 92). However, he has kindly informed me (personal communication, 1 March, 2008) that this surprisingly early date is not his own but that of the museum (for which see http://collectionsonline.lacma.org) recorded on the loan agreement forṁ The lending museum insisted on this date and it was substituted for his own without consulting hiṁ He had assigned it to “ca. 9th century”. In an earlier publication (1975, p. 173, plṣ64a,b) he had proposed the tentḥ REEDY (1997, p. 162, fig. K62) gives ‘9th–10th century’. LINROTHE (1999, p. 289, fig. 211) has found these dates too early and suggests the late tenth or early eleventh century. In the absence of a detailed art-historical demonstration of the date, which I suspect could in any case be no more than tentative given the small population of comparable pieces, I am inclined in the light of the other historical evidence to agree with LINROTHE.

retical framework are likely to be earlier than those in which the level of the oretical assimilation is more advanceḍ By this criterion the Hevajra must be placed after the Laghuśaṁ vara. This also assumes that the development of the Mantranaya was not unilinear throughout, since if it were we would have to place the Laghuśaṁ vara before the Mahāvairocanābhisaṁ bodhi, Sarvatathā gatatattvasaṁ graha, Guhyasamāja, and Sarvabuddhasamāyoga. It assumes, then, that the Yoginītantras represent a new phase with its own humble begin ning, and that it was only later in this phase that the tradition got up to speed, as it were, by fully integrating the new world of practice whose entry marks its commencement by providing it with a thoroughly Buddhist encoding. While it is possible that this assimilation of the text began long after its first redaction it seems more probable in the absence of firm evidence to the contrary that if so problematic a creation were to have remained for long without the benefit of learned exegesis it would be likely to have disappeared without trace. 

As for the provenance of the Laghuśaṁ vara, it was certainly eastern India, the region in which most of the Indian learned exegesis of this Tantric corpus was produceḍ The Tantra does not state this explicitly. Claiming the status of revelation it would have been averse to doing so. Nonetheless, it reveals its provenance in spite of itself by giving BA in its encoding of some of the syllables of Mantras where correct Sanskrit requires VA. This is evidently an effect of the fact that va is pronounced ba in the Indo-Aryan vernaculars of this regioṇ386 Thus 5.4 yields BHAGABATE rather than BHAGAVATE: pa ñcamasya yac caturthaṁ prathamasya tr̥tīyam | trayoviṁśas tathaiva ca caturthasya yaḥ prathamam (f. 5r3–4) ‘the fourth of the fifth [class of consonants] (BHA), the third of the first (GA), the twenty-third (BA), and the first of the fourth (T-)’ ; and 30.20–21 yields BHAGABAM¯.rather than BHAGAVAM¯.(for BHAGAVAN¯ ): koṣt.hakād daśamaṁcaiva vilomena tu sādhakaḥ| koṣt.hakā ekonaviṁśatimaṁtathā trayoviṁśatikoṣt.hakād | dvitīyakoṣt.hasaṁ yuktaṁ bindunā ¯urdhvabh ¯uṣitaṁ(f. 23v4–5) ‘The Sadhaka should select the tenth counting backwards from the ¯ compartment [of HA] (BHA), the nineteenth from that [of A] (GA), and the [letter] from the twenty-third box (B-) together with [the letter in] the second box adorned above with a dot (AM¯.)’. 

Variant readings giving the correct spellings in these cases are founḍ In 5.4 Jayabhadra and Bhavabhat.t.a read ekonnatriṁśa- (sic) and ekonatriṁśati ‘the twenty-ninth’ (VA) rather than the trayoviṁśa- ‘the twenty-third’ (BA) seen in the Baroda manuscript; and this reading is also found in the Tibetan translation (de bzhin nyi shu tsa dgu la [= ekonatriṁśaṁtathaiva ca]) and the redaction

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

of this passage in Pat.ala 54 of the Abhidhānottara (A f. 166r3: ekonnatrinśaṁ tathaiva ca). Likewise in 30.21 we find Jayabhadra giving ekonatriṁśati- (VA) in place of the reading trayoviṁśati (BA) attested by the manuscript, but here the ‘incorrect’ reading is also supported by the Tibetan translation and the commen tary of Bhavabhat.t.a. There can be little doubt that the non-standard readings giving BA rather than VA are original. For it is not surprising there should have been attempts to correct an original BA to VA, whereas it would be most unlikely that any redactor would have made the effort to rewrite a reading that gave VA in order to yield BA.387 

Also indicative of the east-Indian provenance and development of this cor pus are the form chaṁ doha- in place of saṁ doha-,388 and the pervasive promis cuity of the forms -sam´ . vara- and -saṁ vara- in the names of its deity, in the title of the primary Tantra, and in the compound in which this form is pre ceded by ḍākinījāla- or yoginījāla-. I use the forms Sam ´. vara and Cakrasaṁ vara. Laghuśaṁ vara and Cakrasaṁ vara here in keeping with the usual Tibetan trans lations, namely bDe mchog and ’Khor lo sdom pa; and this accords with se mantic analyses of these names and titles in the Sanskrit commentatorṣThus Bhavabhat.t.a explains the second element of the second in the sense ‘he who re strains’ from the the verb saṁ vr̥-, and construes the whole to mean ‘he who by means of the wheel (cakra-) [of the Dharma] restrains [the minds of living be ings from the wrong path] (-saṁ varaḥ)’ (*cakreṇ a saṁ vr̥notīti cakrasaṁ varaḥ), telling us further that the name is extended to the Tantra because this de ity is its subject.389 As for the form Sam ´. vara, that too is widely supporteḍ 

387 It is not probable that the Laghuśaṁ vara was alone among the Yoginītantras in being of east-Indian origiṇ We see the same tell-tale B- for V- in 1.4.27–28 of the Catuṣpīt.ha, the Mantra syllables VAD. AVE being encoded there as BAD. ABE. More over, it is probable that the Apabhraṁ sa seen in some verses of the ´ Hevajra is of the eastern variety. This is suggesred by the noṁ sg. endings -aho and -aha in kibiḍ aho in 2.4.6 and hutāsanaha in 2.4.67; see TAGARE 1987, p. 110–111. An investigation of the language of the Apabhraṁ sa verses that are found in such Yogin ´ītantras as the Hevajra, Khasama, Catuṣpīt.ha, and D.ākārṇ ava, in comparison with that of the Dohā collections of Kan¯ . ha and Saraha, may be expected to shed more light on this question of provenance.

Ratnakara ¯ s´anti explains it as meaning ‘the Highest ( ¯ varam) Bliss’ (śam) when analysing its occurrence in the neuter in the compound ḍākinījālaśaṁ varam;390 and Bhavabhat.t.a when analysing its occurrence in the masculine gender at the end of the same (ḍākinījālaśaṁ varaḥ) takes it to mean ‘[Heruka,] who protects Bliss (śaṁ vr̥ṇ otīti śaṁ varaḥ) [by keeping it free of all defects]’.391 This line of analysis, which applies a meaning of śam that is well-attested in non-sectarian lexicography,392 is not the invention of these commentatorṣThey draw on the authority of the Sarvabuddhasamāyoga, which refers to its deity Vajrasattva as Sam ´. vara and explains that name as meaning ‘[he who has/is the] Highest Bliss’.393 That the -sam´ . vara form is not only old but also original is established

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

by evidence outside the Buddhist corpuṣFor Yoginījala ¯ sam´ . vara is found as the name of a Bhairava in one of the secondary Kalpas taught in the S´ akta ¯ Saiva ´ Picumata,394 which, as we shall see, was a major unacknowledged source for the redactor of the Laghuśaṁ vara. That the form intended there is -sam´ . vara rather than -saṁ vara- is certain, because the text provides a semantic analysis that takes the first syllable to mean bliss (sukham).395 

However, these are not the only viewṣJayabhadra, commenting on 1.2 of the Laghuśaṁ vara, takes the same expression to be D.ākinījālasaṁ vara, un derstanding it to refer to the Laghuśaṁ vara itself and explaining it as ‘The Concealment of the Array of D. akin ¯īs’, deriving the last element of the com pound from saṁ vr̥- ‘to envelop’;396 and while the Tibetans usually render the 

The first Pada is also supported by Bhavabhat ¯ .t.a, who quotes it without attribu tion, when explaining ḍākinījālaśaṁ varam in Laghuśaṁ vara 1.2: śaṁsukham iti cākhyātam iti vacanāt. 

394 Yoginījala ¯ sam´ . vara in this text is a form of Bhairava and the term refers by extension to his Mantra and the associated system of practice (vratam). See Picumata f. 251r5–v1 (56.4c–6b): śr̥ṇ u devi pravakṣyāmi sarvayogiprasādhanam | yāgamantrasamopetaṁ yoginījālaśaṁ varam | yena vij ñātamātreṇ a trailokye khe carīpadam |āsādya krīḍ ate mantrī kulasiddhisamanvitaḥ‘Listen, O Devī. I shall teach you about Yoginījala ¯ sam´ . vara together with the deities with whom he is to be worshipped (yāga-) and his Mantra, as the means of propitiating the YoginīṣAs soon as the Mantra adept has mastered this he will reach the domain of the Khe carīs and move freely through the triple universe, possessing [all] the supernatural powers of the [Yoginī] clans’. 

395 Picumata f. 251v2–3 (56.12–13b): sam ¯uhaṁjālam ity uktaṁ yoginīnāṁ maho dayam | śaṁsukhaṁ vara dātr̥tvā<t> *sam ¯uhatvavivakṣayā (sam ¯uhatva eṁ : sam ¯uhatvaṁ Coḍ) | * yogeśiyogabhāvasthaṁ(yogeśiyoga conj. : yogayogīsa Coḍ) ´ yoginījālaśaṁ varam | mantraṁtu kathitaṁ devi bhairavasyāmitātmakam ‘The ex pression Yoginījala [in Yogin ¯ījala ¯ sam´ . vara] means the exalted totality of the Yoginīs, jālam ‘net’ denoting ‘multitude’ [here]. The śaṁ of -sam´ . vara means ‘bliss’ (sukham). The Yoginījala ¯ sam´ . vara[mantra] is so named because it is the bestower (-vara) of that bliss, [-vara- being formed as an agent noun from the verb vr̥- ‘to give’]. It is the granter of this bliss to the Yoginījala in as much as it is located in the inner state ¯ of *the Yoga of the Yogesvar ´īs, the plurality of these being intended in the sense of their totality (conj.). The Mantra of Bhairava [that bears this name] is infinite [in its power]’. 

396 Jayabhadra, Cakrasaṁ varapa ñjikā on 1.1–2b (athāto rahasyaṁ vakṣye samāsān na tu vistarāt | śrīherukasaṁ yogaṁsarvakāmārthasādhakam | uttarād api cottaraṁ ḍākinījālasaṁ varam ‘Next I shall teach the secret, in brief rather than at length, the congress of Sr´īheruka, the accomplisher of all desires, the D.ākinījālasaṁ vara, higher even than the higher’): uttarād api cottaram iti deśyadeśakayor abhedāt | yāny uttaratantrāṇi samājādīni teṣām apy uttaratvād uktaṁ| ḍākinījālasaṁ varam iti | ḍākinyaḥsarvās tricakravyavasthitāḥ| tāsāṁjālaḥsam ¯uhas tasya saṁ varaḥ| saṁ varaṇ aṁ gopanam ity arthaḥ‘It is referred to as higher even than the higher because it is higher even than the Tantras [of the Yogottara class] headed by the [Guhya]samāja, which are ‘higher’ because the difference between teacher and the taught is absent [in them].

Cakra- name ’Khor lo sdom pa and so support the form Cakrasaṁ vara, we also find ’Khor lo bde mchog in their translations, which supports the alternative Cakrasam´ . vara.397 

The reason for this inconstancy is evidently that śa and sa are both pro nounced as śa in Bengali, as they were in the Magadh ¯ī Prakrit of the drama tistṣ398 Consequently, instead of attempting to decide which form is correct we should recognize that for the east-Indian followers of this tradition there was in effect only one word here (śaṁ vara/saṁ vara), which could be understood either as ‘the highest (-vara- [Tib. mchog]) bliss (śam [Tib. bde])’ or as ‘fusion’ and the like by derivation from the verbal root vr̥ preceded by the preverb saṁ That this was the case is demonstrated by a passage in the Saṁ varodaya in which the two semantic analyses, explaining śaṁ vara- and saṁ vara- respectively, are given for one and the same worḍ399 

S´ AM. VARA/VAJRARUDRA AND VAJRAVAR¯ AH¯ ¯I: THE TRANSFORMATION OF BHAIRAVA AND HIS CONSORT. What marks the new start seen in the Yoginī tantras is a far more comprehensive adoption of the practices of the Saiva ´ Vidyap¯īt.ha texts, to the extent that there is little in the observances of these texts that does not draw on that source. Heruka is now paired with a lustful consort (Vajravarāh¯ī in the Cakrasaṁ vara texts and Nairatmy ā in those of ¯ Hevajra), and in the case of the Cakrasaṁ vara tradition, so are the principal Yoginīs of his retinue, a feature that matches the practice of the Vidyap¯īt.ha’s Picumata (Brahmayāmala). Moreover, in the case of the tradition elaborated on 

the basis of the Laghuśaṁ vara the icon of Heruka has several blatantly obvious features of the iconography of Siva (/Bhairava) in addition to those manifest in ´ 

in the three circuits [of the Maṇ ḍ ala of Cakrasaṁ vara], saṁ varaḥ being derived from the verb saṁ vr̥- ‘to conceal’ in the sense of the action of concealing’. 397 In the DT ’khor lo sdom pa (cakrasaṁ vara-) occurs about 250 times and ’khor lo bde mchog (cakraśaṁ vara-) about 100; see, e.g., DT, Rgyud ’grel, vol. cha, f. 242v3 (’khor lo bde mchog gi gzugs can); vol. ja, f. 58v7 (’khor lo bde mchog gi rgyud), and f. 102r7 (’khor lo bde mchog gi sngags). 

398 See, for Magadh ¯ī, Vararuci, Prākr̥taprakāśa 11.2: ṣasoḥśaḥ‘ś is used in place of both ṣand s’. Generally in Middle and New Indo-Aryan the three Sanskrit sibilants have been reduced to ṣIt has been reported that in the Tantric Buddhist Dohā texts, composed in what has been called Eastern Apabhraṁ sa, ´ ś has been preserved in derivatives of words that have it in Sanskrit (TAGARE 1987, p. 77). It is true that a few such forms are found in the manuscripts (SHAHIDULLAH 1928, p. 37), but there are many cases in which ś does not appear, such as suṇ ṇ a for Skr̥ ś ¯unya. It is likely that the occasional distinction between ś and s was learned window-dressing and that both consonants were pronounced ´ṣ

She is red, one-faced, and two-armed, naked but for a filigree of fragments of human bone adorning her hips (asthimekhalā), her right arm raised aloft holding a chopping-knife, with her index finger extended in a gesture of threatening the wicked, and her left arm, wrapped around Heruka’s neck, holding to their mouths a skull bowl full of human blood and entrails, wearing a garland of fifty desiccated heads and the five Kapālika bone-ornaments, laughing, and intoxicated by lust. They are sur- ¯ rounded by a retinue of thirty-six goddesses termed Yoginīs, D. akin ¯īs, Vīresvar ´īs, or Vīriṇīs visualized in the same Kapālika style, in concentric circuits of four, ¯ twenty-four, and eight, the twenty-four embracing Vīra consorts and worshipped as residing in twenty-four sacred sites covering the whole subcontinent, from Uḍ ḍiyana in the north to R āme ¯ svara at India’s southern tip, from Sindhu in ´ the west to Devīkot.t.a in the east. The whole is surrounded by a ring of eight cremation groundṣ400 

The features of Siva’s iconography evident here are the trident, the third ´ eye, the new moon on the piled up braids, the tiger-skin lower garment, the multiple faces and arms, the skull-bowl, the skull-staff, the bleeding elephant hide, the severed head of Brahma, the snake as brahmanical thread, the sharp ¯ fangs, the chaplet of skulls, his dwelling in the cremation grounds, and the ashes

The image, then, has every appearance of representing a Buddhist trans formation of Siva himself in his Bhairava aspect. Indeed in his commentary on ´ 

the Laghuśaṁ vara Jayabhadra refers to this Heruka as Vajrarudra, that is to say, as Siva/Bhairava converted and liberated by assimilation into the essence of ´ Buddha-hood,409 thereby definitively surrendering and transcending his Saiva ´ identity. In clear expression of this transcendence Heruka/Vajrarudra and Va jravarāh¯ī are depicted and visualized standing on the sprawling, terrified bodies of a black Bhairava and a red, emaciated Kalar ātri, their own pre-Buddhist iden- ¯ tities as the principal deities of the Vidyap¯īt.ha.410

Vajrarudra appears already in the Sarvabuddhasamāyoga in a passage that associates the nine dramatic sentiments (rasāḥ) with Vajrasattva, Tathagata, ¯ Vajradhara, Lokesvara, Vajras ´ urya, Vajrarudra, ¯ S´ akyamuni, ¯ Arali (or perhaps ¯ Aralli), and ¯ S´ a¯svata (Vairocana) respectively. Vajrarudra’s is the sentiment of ter- ´ ror (bhayānakarasaḥ) and it is probable therefore that we should understand Vajra rudra to be Heruka.

THE RISE OF THE GODDESS TO INDEPENDENCE. Here Heruka’s consort is visibly his dependent: while he has four faces and twelve arms she has only one and two. But in the subsequent development of this tradition we find a strongly S´ akta tendency to elevate her to equality with Heruka and eventually to superi- ¯ ority, just as occurred in the development of the Vidyap¯īt.ha.411 Thus in certain other Kalpas in which Heruka is united with Vajravarāh¯ī at the centre of the Maṇ ḍ ala her status is raised by endowing her with four faces and four or more armṣThis is the case in the Kalpa of the sixth Pat.ala of the Abhidhānottara, which teaches what it calls the ekavīravidhānam, the procedure in which the two deities alone are worshipped as ‘solitary heroes’ (ekavīra-), that is to say, without the the retinue of the thirty-six Yoginīs and twenty-four VīraṣHere Heruka has twelve arms and Vajravarāh¯ī four, holding a blood-filled skull-bowl, a chopping knife raised aloft with the gesture of threat, a rattle-drum, and a skull-staff.

There are other forms of this kind, among which one is particulary worthy of note because it shows her four-faced and twelve-armed like Heruka himself, his equal as it were or, rather, the fusion of both within her, since her fanged face is divided down the middle into a male half on her right and a female half on her left (ardhanārīśvaramukhā), a S´ akta reflex of the well-known Ardhan ār¯īsvara ´ image of Siva. She has the same hand-attributes as the twelve-armed Heruka ´ except that the battle-axe and trident have gone, an elephant-goad has taken the latter’s place. The hand that held the skull-staff now holds the skull-bowl, the skull-staff rests in the crook of that arm, and the two hands that are now free form the flame gesture (jvālāmudrā) on her foreheaḍ The place of the elephant hide is taken by the flayed skin of a maṇ She holds the Vajra and bell in her crossed principal hands and turns them over each other in the gesture known as the revolving lotus (kamalāvartaḥ). She is red, naked, and intoxicated with pas sion, adorned with all six Mudras, the new moon and crossed Vajras on her hair, ā chaplet of skulls above her forehead, and the bone-filigree around her hipṣShe dances wildly in the centre of her retinue, visualized at the moment that she stands with her left leg on the ground flexed at the knee and her right foot raised and placed on the inside of her left thigh with the right knee turned out.

The cult of the independent goddess (Bhagavatī) appears to have been a particularly vigorous development, to judge from the exceptionally large number of variant forms that emergeḍ420 Within the earlier scriptural lit erature the Abhidhānottara contains several sections devoted to Sadhanas of ¯ Vajravarāhi; ¯421 in the Herukābhyudaya eleven of its forty-four chapters are devoted to her Mantras and their procedures;422 and the section of the Tenjur devoted to the Cakrasaṁ vara cycle (Toḥ 1403–1606) contains over sixty texts ¯ devoted to the varieties of her cult as Vajravarāh¯ī or Vajrayoginī (Toḥ 1541– ¯ 1606). S´ akyaraks ¯ .ita, a pupil of Abhayakaragupta (1064–1125), after detailing ¯ the Sadhana of several of her forms in his ¯ Abhisamayama ñjarī,423 adds that these are but a few of the many that were current in his time:424 

So it should be understood that in accordance with the various mentalities of those requiring to be trained there are countless traditions of the Goddess such as this, transmitted through the generations from teacher to pupil in accordance with the [founding] instruction of various SiddhaṣWhat I have shown here is no more than an indicative fraction of the whole. 

This S´ akta trend is also evidenced in the practice of the Newars of the Kath- ¯ mandu valley down modern timeṣFor their ceremony of initiation before the Maṇ ḍ ala of Cakrasaṁ vara is followed on the final day by initiation before 

419 This form is taught in Abhidhānottara ff. 63v1–70r4 (Pat.ala 9 in the enumera tion of this manuscript), from which it entered the Vārāhyabhyudaya. A lightly adjusted version of this Kalpa is found in the collection of Sadhanas of Va- ¯ jravarāh¯ī/Vajrayoginī that came to bear the title Guhyasamayasādhanamālā in the colophons of later manuscripts; see ENGLISH 2002, pp. 54–59.

the Maṇ ḍ ala of Vajradevī (Vajravarāh¯ī).425 Nor was this confined to the sub continent. In Tibet too Vajravarāh¯ī/Vajrayoginī rose to a position of special honour, notably in the bKa’ brgyud and Sa skya traditions, but also in later times among the dGe lug pas, rNying ma pas, and Bon poṣ426 

There are other compilations, scriptural and secondary, that survive in Nepalese manuscripts but did not reach Tibet, which attest her prominence in the last phase of the Mantranaya: the Vajravārāhīkalpa, of about three thousand verses, which interweaves the D.ākārṇ ava and the Saṁ varodaya, and incorporates thirteen non-scriptural Sadhana texts of Vajrav ārāh¯ī and one of Nairatmy ā, the consort of Hevajra; ¯427 the closely related Yoginījāla, of about one thousand verses; and the collection of forty-six Sadhanas of ¯ Vajrayoginī known as the Guhyasamayasādhanamālā.428 Moreover, two texts devoted to the cult of this goddess were added to the canon of scripture re ceived by the TibetanṣThe first is the Vārāhyabhyudayatantra, a short work of three hundred verses counted among the explanatory Tantras of the Laghuśaṁ vara but consisting almost entirely of passages lifted from the Saṁ put.odbhava, the Abhidhānottara, and the Saṁ varodaya;429 and the second 

425 GELLNER 1992, pp. 273–279. His account of the ceremonies is based upon what he was told by the late Asha Kaji Vajracharya (ibiḍ, p. 273). That the Cakrasaṁ vara initiation is followed by a separate Vajradevī initiation is confirmed by the evidence of the Dīkṣāvidhi, the manual in the Newari language that guides these ritualṣ

426 See ENGLISH 2002, pp. xxii–xxvii. 

427 I have not yet undertaken a thorough analysis of the whole text. The interweav ing that I report is of D.ākārṇ ava, Pat.ala 2–3 and Saṁ varodaya 2–3 in the first 3 Pat.alaṣThe nidānavākyam of the Saṁ varodaya is borrowed with the substitution of vārāhībhageṣu for the Saṁ varodaya’s yoginībhageṣu. I have noted the incorpo ration of the following Sadhana texts (identified here with the numbers ascribed ¯ in BHATTACHARYA’s composite Sādhanamālā): 217–218 in Pat.ala 36, 219–225 in Pat.ala 37, 226–228 and 231 in Pat.ala 38. 

428 This is the title under which the work has been catalogued in TSUKAMOTO et al. 1989, p. 285. It is based, I surmise, on the colophon of the last Sadhana in the ¯ collection, the D.ākinīguhyasamayasādhana of Anangayogiṇ ˙

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

is the Vidyādharīkramavajrayoginīsādhana, which appears in the Kanjur (Toḥ ¯ 380) between the major Tantras of the Cakrasaṁ vara cycle and those of con tested authenticity,430 included perhaps, in spite of its genre, because it states in its opening words that it is part of the otherwise unattested Mahāmāyājālo rdhvajat.ottaratantra, which, it claims, was extracted from the Trilakṣa, that it to say, from the vast mythical Ur-text of this cycle, the Trilakṣābhidhāna.431 

Further evidence of this S´ akta trend is seen in the views of the tradition ¯ concerning the nature of the revelation of this Ur-text, which, it was claimed, contained the required Buddhist preamble (nidānavākyam) that is lacking in the Laghuśaṁ vara itself. Bhavabhat.t.a, taking care not to claim direct access to that mythical source, saying only that his knowledge of its nidānavākyam has reached him through the lineage of his teachers (guruparamparā),432 asserts that it reveals that the teacher of the Tantra was Bhagavan Mah āvajradhara, ¯ the requester his consort Bhagavatī Vajravarāh¯ī, and the reciter Vajrapan¯ .i. These then, it follows for Bhavabhat.t.a, are the dramatis personae of the Laghuśaṁ vara too. But he reports a contrary view that Vajravarāh¯ī was the teacher and Mahavajradhara her pupil. ¯433 The imposition on the text of the claim that it is a dialogue between the deity and his goddess-consort brings it into line with the Saiva scriptural literature of the Vidy ´ ap¯īt.ha. For there the Tantras take the form of Bhairava’s teachings in answer to the questions of the Goddess (Devī/Bhairavī). In the explanatory Tantras of the Cakrasaṁ vara cycle this model is made explicit in the Vajraḍāka, where Vajrasattva/Vajraḍ aka ¯ teaches in response to the questions of Devī, and in the D.ākārṇ ava and Va jravārāhīkalpa, where Vīresvara responds to the questions of V ´īresvar ´ī. But in the Caturyoginīsaṁ put.a, another of the satellite Tantras of this cycle, the goddess Vajriṇī (Vajravarāh¯ī) is the teacher and Vajrin (Heruka) the ques tioner̥434 That this inversion seen in the view reported by Bhavabhat.t.a and 

430 In Sanskrit it is preserved as the twenty-first Sadhana in the ¯ Guhyasamaya sādhanamālā, ff. 85r4–86r1.

in the Caturyoginīsaṁ put.a is evidence of a more S´ akta tendency within the ¯ tradition is obvious in itself, but it is confirmed by parallel practice in the most S´ akta of the ¯ Saiva scriptures, namely the ´ Kālīkulakramasadbhāva, the Kālīkulapa ñcaśataka, and the Manthānabhairava.

Nor is the adoption of the Vidyap¯īt.ha’s practices restricted to externalṣIt also extended into the domain of Yoga. For one of the most striking features that distinguish the Yoginītantras from the Yogatantras and indeed from all that pre ceded them in the history of Buddhism is that they based their inner practice on the theory that the body is pervaded and sustained by a network of energy channels (nāḍī), variously numbered, with three pre-eminent: two vertical lat eral channels, lalanā and rasanā, and a hidden third extending between up the centre of the body to the head, called avadh ¯utī or caṇ ḍālī, with Cakras located along its course, which was to be awakened and perceived as the means of access to the bliss (sahajānandaḥ, mahāsukham) of enlightened awarenesṣThis Yoga of meditation on the channels of the vital energy and the Cakras is not found in the transitional Sarvabuddhasamāyoga448 nor indeed in the Laghuśaṁ vara,

For Tsong kha pa’s detailed treatment of this practice of ascent from the body see MULLIN 1996, pp. 209–215. His sources are those Tantras listed here: the Catuṣpīt.ha (and Bhavabhat.t.a’s com mentary), the Vajraḍāka, the Saṁ put.a (= Saṁ put.odbhava), and the Saṁ varodaya. MULLIN translates the Tibetan rendering of these titles into Englisḥ He identifies his ‘Mystic Kiss Tantra’ as the Caturyoginīsaṁ put.a. It is in fact the Saṁ put.a, the work that also appears in this translation as the Sambhuta Tantra, reproducing a faulty Tibetan transcription of the same title. Tsong kha pa notes that this prac tice of ascent from one’s body (utkrāntiḥ) is a unique feature of the highest (bla na med) Buddhist Tantra class (MULLIN 1996, p. 209). That is so within the Buddhist Tantras; but the source of the practice is the Saiva tradition, whose texts have al- ´ ways placed a great emphasis on it both in the Atimarga and in the Mantram ārga; ¯ see Pāśupatas ¯utra 5.30–40; Pampāmāhātmya 11.54–71 (explaining that pas sage); Skandapurāṇ a-Ambikākhaṇ ḍ a, Adhyāya 182; Rauravas ¯utrasaṁ graha, Pat.ala 9; Sārdhatriśatikālottara 11.13–19b; Dviśatika-Kālottara ff. 2v9–3r6; Tray odaśaśatika-Kālottara ff. 30r9–31r7; Kiraṇ a, Pat.ala 59; Mataṅgapārameśvara, Caryāpāda, Pat.ala 9; Picumata, Pat.ala 100; Mālinīvijayottara 17.25–33; Tantrasadbhāva f. 36r11–v10 (9.294–321); Tantrāloka 28.292–302; and, in Java/Bali, J ñānasiddhānta, chapters 3, 5–7, and 20.

but it is much developed in the latter’s ancillary scriptures such as the Vajraḍāka and Saṁ varodaya, and elsewhere in the Yoginītantras, notably in the Hevajra, the Saṁ put.odbhava, the Mahāmudrātilaka, and the Kālacakra.449 

The elements of this model are ‘purifed through equation’ (viśuddha-) with Buddhist soteriological factors, either newly acquired, such as the twenty-four sacred sites or long established in the Mahayāna, such as the three bodies of ā Buddha (nirmāṇ akāyaḥ, saṁ bhogakāyaḥ, and dharmakāyaḥ), equated with the three principal channels, and Means (upāyaḥ) and Wisdom (praj ñā), whose co-functioning (yuganaddhavāhitā) is the way to liberation, equated with the lateral pair̥450 But the basic conception is derived from the Yoga of the Saivas in ´ general and the S´ akta ¯ Saivas in particular̥ ´ 

THE INCORPORATION OF TEXT-PASSAGES FROM THE VIDYAP¯ ¯IT. HA. In the light of this evidence of the pervasive similarities between the Yoginītantras and the Saivism of the Vidy ´ ap¯īt.ha, and considering the fact that these similarities set the Yoginītantras apart from all earlier forms of Buddhism, the reader will not be surprised to know that there is also evidence that this tradition incorporated 

449 That the Yoga of the energy channels was one of the principal features that distin guished the Yoginītantras was asserted by the learned of the Mantranaya itself; see Sraddh ´ akaravarman cited here on p.239; also Mkhas grub rje, ¯ rGyud spyi, p. 256, ll. 6–7: phung khams skye mched kyi rnam dag gtso bor ston pa’s rgyud yin na pha rgyud | rtsa’i rnam dag gtso bor ston pa ma rgyud ‘If a Tantra principally teaches the purification of the Skandhas, Dhatus, and ¯ Ayatanas it is a Father Tantra. A Mother ¯ Tantra principally teaches the purification of the energy channels’. In this pas sage the distinction is between the esoteric Yogatantras (Mahayogatantras, Yogot- ¯ taratantras) headed by the Guhyasamāja and the Yoginītantras or Yoganiruttara tantras exemplified by the Tantras of Sam ´. vara and Hevajra, the two divisions of what the Tibetans called bla med kyi rgyud ‘the unsurpassed Tantra [class]’. Mkhas grub rje’s tradition rejects this criterion for distinguishing between the two divi sions on the grounds that there are Yoginītantras (Mother Tantras) that also teach the purification of the Skandhas and the rest. That is true. We find this, for exam ple, in the Hevajra (1.7.12; 1.9.6–9, 13–14; 2.2.31–36) and the Abhidhānottara (e.g. B ff. 20v5–21r1; f. 26r3; f. 36r3–v6; f. 51r3–4; ff. 69v2–70r1). But that is because the second-wave Yoginītantras sought to encompass the tradition of the Guhyasamāja by incorporating many of its elementṣHe does not, we may note, support his argu ment by pointing to the presence of the purification of the energy channels in any Father Tantra. From the historian’s point of view the distinction that he rejects remains accurate in spite of his objectionṣVAN SCHAIK (2008, p. 50) has noted the absence of material on the manipulation of the internal energies in the Dunhuang manuscripts, which represent Tantric Buddhism up to about the middle of the ninth century. 

450 For a comprehensive listing of ‘purifying equations’ for the principal channels and four Cakras (the Nirman¯ . acakra at the root of the navel, the Dharmacakra in the heart, the Saṁ bhogacakra in the throat, and the Mahasukhacakra in the head) see ¯ J ñānodayatantra, p. 6, ll. 1–14 (the four Cakras), and p. 6, l. 20–p. 7, l. 9 (the three channels).

and adapted much textual material from the Saiva scriptures in the process of ´ producing its owṇ 

This is particularly evident in the case of the Laghuśaṁ vara and its satelliteṣI have reported and tabulated elsewhere correspondences with passages in five Saiva scriptures: (1) the ´ Yoginīsaṁcāra of the third S. at.ka of the Jayadrathayāmala,451 (2) the short redaction of the Siddhayogeśvarīmata— a much longer redaction, known to Abhinavagupta, has not come down to us—, (3) the Tantrasadbhāva, (4) the Picumata (/Brahmayāmala), and (5) the Niśisaṁcāra, all of which are texts of the Vidyap¯īt.ha. There are also a few correspondences with earlier texts of the Buddhist Mantranaya;452 but unlike those the Laghuśaṁ vara’s parallels with the Vidyap¯īt.ha are not short passages of one or two verses but detailed and continuous expositions that run in two cases over several chapters, amounting in all to some 200 verses out of a total of 

451 The Yoginīsaṁcāra, though it comes to us as part of the Jayadrathayāmala, has very probably been incorporated from another source. This is evident from the reg ister of its Sanskrit, from its style, and from its content. This source may be a text closely related to the lost Yoginījālaśaṁ vara. For it claims at its beginning to be about to explain what has already been taught in that Tantra. Jayadrathayāmala, S. at.ka 3, f. 169r8 (Yoginīsaṁcāra 1.1–6b): devy uvāca k purā tu sam´.vare tantre yad uktaṁ parameśvara | *tan na (eṁ : tatra Coḍ) j ñātaṁ mayā deva guhyatantrasya vistarāt k 2 kathaṁsa bhairavo dehas tvayi deva mahābalaḥ| kathaṁ devyo yajanty enaṁ kulās tāsāṁ kati smr̥tāḥk 3 kathaṁ kramaṁ mahāg ¯uḍ ha<ṁ > cāraṁtāsāṁ kathaṁ vibho | carusiddhiḥ kathaṁtāsām etan me br ¯uhi vistaram k 4 evamākarṇ ya deveśyāvadanāmburuhacyutam | vacomr̥taṁ mahādevo bh ¯uyo vacanam abravīt k 5 sādhu sādhu mahābhage sarvaj ñānārthabhājane | mahārahasyam atulaṁ yo ginīcāram uttamam k 6 pravakṣyāmi samāsena śr̥ṇ uṣv’ ekāgramānasā ‘The goddess said: Paramesvara, I have not understood the teaching that you gave of old in the ´ Sam´.varatantra, because of the great length of [that] esoteric text.

about 700 with some prose equivalent in length to about 80 more. They teach the characteristics by which the initiate may recognize women as belonging to various classes of Yoginī, D. akin ¯ī, and Lamā, and vocabularies of special ¯ words and gestures (chommāḥ) for communicating with them when encountered (Pat.alas 15–24), the rules (samayāḥ) that bind initiates as they engage in post-initiatory caryā (Pat.alas 26–29), the system of Pīt.has and other sacred pilgrimage centres for wandering ascetics engaged in this practice (Pat.ala 41), and the characteristics of the ideal sacrificial victim known as a saptāvartaḥ or saptajanmā (Pat.ala 49).453 

These parallels demonstrate a high degree of overlap with the Saiva ´ Vidyap¯īt.ha in the parts of the text and its satellites that deal with the religious discipline (samayācāraḥ) of the adherents of this form of Buddhisṁ Still lacking, however, was evidence of textual dependence in those parts that deal with that discipline’s ritual core. But that gap can now be closeḍ For since publishing those results I have located further evidence in what survives of the Vidyap¯īt.ha’s scriptures that this corpus was also the source of substantial parts of the Laghuśaṁ vara’s instruction in this domaiṇ The areas of prescription in which this textual dependence has emerged are (1) the daily worship of the ‘Kulika’ prescribed in the first chapter of the ¯ Laghuśaṁ vara, (2) the ceremony of initiation before the Maṇ ḍ ala through which a candidate becomes qualified and obliged to practice the Tantra’s rites and observance, which is taught from the end of the first chapter to the beginning of the fourth; and (3) the ritual procedures for supernatural effects, mostly hostile sorcery, that form a considerable part of the work and take the form of fire-sacrifices (homaḥ), and the use of the Mantras and the name of the target (sādhyanāma) to empower substances in various ways and combinations to bring about these resultṣThese new parallels are as follows: 

1. The worship of the Kulika: ¯ Laghuśaṁ vara 1.4–7b (< Herukābhyudaya 15.6–10) < Picumata 84.9c–16. 

2. The initiation ceremony: Laghuśaṁ vara 1.15–4.1 < 8.3–28 of the Yo ginīsaṁcāra. 

3. The ritual procedures for supernatural effects: 

（a）Laghuśaṁ vara, Pat.ala 34 < Picumata 41.1–3, 49.3c–4c, 41.4–7b, 41.12abc, and 41.15ḍ 

（b）Laghuśaṁ vara, Pat.ala 35 < Picumata 26.1–2b, 26.41c–44.

Comparison of the textual parallels reveals that it is the Cakrasaṁ vara cor pus that has adopted and adapted the Saiva sources rather than the other way ´ 

rounḍ For the Buddhist versions abound in instances in which it can be seen that Saiva material has been misunderstood, crudely, artificially, and incom- ´ pletely modified, or rendered contextually incongruouṣThe Saiva versions, on ´ the other hand, seem to me to be entirely free of signs of textual dependence on Buddhist originalṣ

Before proceeding to demonstrate this through the presentation and analy sis of examples I wish first to address an objection that has been raised against my conclusioṇ454 I do so before my analysis because that objection, if it were valid, would block in advance the force of all my evidence, being based not on contrary analyses of particular parallels but on a perceived characteristic of all the materials I have identifieḍ This characteristic is that the Buddhist versions are less clear in meaning, less grammatically correct. By concluding that the direction of redaction is from Saiva materials to the Buddhist in spite of this ´ characteristic I am held to have overlooked or violated the textual critic’s maxim lectio difficilior potior ‘The more difficult reading is to be preferred’. This maxim means that when one is confronted by two readings, both of which are plausible, one should prefer that which is less easily explained as the result of the alter ation, accidental or deliberate, of the other, provided there is a clearly established line of transmission between the sources of the divergent readingṣThus, it is implied, the less clear and more incorrect Buddhist versions should be judged to have preceded the clearer and more correct Saiva versions on the grounds that it ´ is conceivable that a Saiva redactor revised a deficient Buddhist version but not ´ that a Buddhist spoiled a superior Saiva versioṇ ´ 455 

What exactly the concept of lack of clarity is thought to cover in this argu

455 In fact it is not clear whether these authors think that the application of this princi ple means that the Buddhist versions cannot be secondary or only that it less likely that they are. The second alternative alone would accord with a more fundamental principle of textual criticism, namely that there are no hard-and-fast rules because every textual problem must be regarded as possibly unique (HOUSMAN 1921, pp. 68–69). 

[[189]]

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

ment is unclear; but I assume that the authors had in mind not merely gram matical deviations from the Paninian standard of high scholarship, since those are seldom difficult to understand, being characteristic of a particular register of the language, but also and principally lack of clarity in meaning caused by syntactical incoherence and the like, which is indeed a conspicuous defect in the Buddhist versionṣIndeed they are sometimes barely intelligible, as is revealed by fact that the commentators confronted by these passages offer widely diver gent but equally arbitary interpretationṣ456 

Now, the objection that a version which is less clear in this sense must have preceded one that is freer of these defects, proceeds from a serious misunder standing of how the rule of the lectio difficilior is to be applieḍ Firstly, like all other ‘rules’ of textual criticism, it should never be put to work mechanically and in advance, without the application of thought to the weighing of probabilities in each case; and secondly, it should never be invoked to give precedence to readings that are grammatically defective, incoherent, or contextually awkwarḍ457 Lack of clarity is hardly likely to the fault of the original framers of the text-passages, who, after all, probably knew what they wanted to say in whatever register of Sanskrit they chose to adopt. It is much more likely to be the result of incompe tence and/or carelessness on the part of Buddhist redactors who had difficulty in understanding the Saiva texts they were cannibalizing. ´ 

The secondary status of the Buddhist versions is also apparent in another deficiency: their greater metrical irregularity. In principle that might be ex plained either as the result of the Saivas’ having polished the Buddhist versions ´ or as the result of indifference to the preservation of metrical form on the part of Buddhist redactors as they adapted metrically correct Saiva materialṣBut the ´ latter explanation is much to be preferreḍ For, as we shall see, metrical irreg ularity is particularly noticeable in the Buddhist versions at those places where the imprint of Buddhism is apparent.458 

Let us assume, however, that there are indeed readings in the Buddhist ver sions which do not derive from the Saiva parallels that I have identifieḍ Would ´ these not refute my conclusion that the Buddhist versions are secondary? No. For 

456 See here p. 216. 

457 This point has been made against DAVIDSON and GRAY by SZANT ´ O´ (2008b, p. 218). On the principle invoked here, that a ‘more difficult reading’ must be plausible, see WEST 1973, p. 51: “When we choose the ‘more difficult reading’ . . . we must be sure that it is in itself a plausible reading. The principle should not be used in support of dubious syntax, or phrasing that it would not have been natural for the author to use. There is an important difference between a more difficult reading and a more unlikely reading”; CHADWICK 1957, p. 255: “The principle lectio difficilior potior does not extend to nonsense, . . . ”. 

458 See here p. 207. 

[[190]]

the inference that they would rests on the assumption that I consider that the Saiva text-passages redacted into the Buddhist versions were ´ exactly those seen in these parallelṣIn fact I hold that the collation of these parallels with the Bud dhist passages demonstrates that the former are, in most cases at least, closely related variants of the passages on which the Buddhist redactors drew, and that these passages were accessed in what were probably earlier and less elaborate redactions of the works in which I have found the parallels, or else in texts of the same corpus which are now out of reach, such as the Yoginījālaśaṁ vara, the Sarvavīrasamāyoga, the long version of the Siddhayogeśvarīmata, and the Pa ñcāmr̥ta.459 For what survives in the manuscript collections of India and Nepal is only a part of what once existed, as we learn both from citations of other texts in the works of learned Saiva commentators and from the surviv- ´ ing scriptural redactions themselves, which, when listing the canon of texts to which they belong, mention many works, such as those mentioned above, which have not survived or await discovery.460 My argument, then, is not that these Saiva parallels are the direct sources of the Buddhist versions but only that the ´ Saiva parallels are close enough to the Buddhist versions to reveal the direction ´ 

459 On these sources see SANDERSON 2007, pp. 234–237, footnotes 15–16, and 21–22. 460 See, for example, the list of Tantras ‘venerated by the circle of Yoginīs’ given in the first chapter of the Yoginīsaṁcāra as sources on the matters it covers (Jayadrathayāmala, S. at.ka 3, ff.

of dependence. It is possible, therefore, that any ‘more difficult readings’ were in herited from this earlier stratum in the development of the Vidyap¯īt.ha; and this mere possibility is sufficient to invalidate the inference of the priority of the Bud dhist versionṣIf I am mistaken in my conclusion that the Buddhist versions are secondary that will have to be demonstrated by presenting a persuasive contrary analysis of the relationship between the Saiva and Buddhist versions based on a ´ detailed examination of the particulars I have identifieḍ General arguments of this kind, which attempt to settle the matter in advance without engaging with the specifics of the parallels, will not suffice.461 

Having dealt with this objection I can now turn to the evidence. In advance of a more thoroughgoing demonstration I consider a few passages here that re veal that the Buddhist redactors were using Saiva materials and enable us to ´ see how they did so. 

I have mentioned the entry into the Cakrasaṁ vara corpus of two lists of S´ akta sacred siteṣThat found in the ¯ Vajraḍāka, ff. 42r1–43v3 (18.10–60) cor responds very closely in the Vidyap¯īt.ha to Niśisaṁcāra, ff. 16v–19v (4.6b–5.11), both in content and wording. The passage lists twenty-four sacred sites and identifies for each its presiding goddess, the high Tantric goddess to whose family she is assigned, her weapon (āyudham), the site’s sacred tree, and a guardian Bhairava (kṣetrapālaḥ).462 The version in the Vajraḍāka leaves 

461 The same applies to a line of defence that objects to my conclusion in a manner that renders even a non-specific engagement with the parallels unnecessary. Confronted with the information that such parallels have been claimed some are inclined to respond with the question “Why would Buddhists have drawn on Saiva sources?” ´ The question is purely rhetorical and somewhat plaintive, implying that since the authors of these texts were Buddhists they would surely not have drawn on non Buddhist scriptureṣThe inference has no force at all, because it invokes a notion of the nature of Buddhism and consequently of what Buddhists can or cannot have done that is derived from texts other than those of this corpuṣNo amount of evi dence that other Buddhist scriptures were free of dependence on non-Buddhist texts can counter evidence that these Buddhist scriptures were not. 

462 Closely related to the Niśisaṁcāra text is a version seen in Kubjikāmata 22.23– 46, which lacks one of its elements, namely the specification of the high Tantric goddesses to whose families these local goddesses belong. Another, somewhat di vergent and giving the sites alone and the points on the body that should be empowered by them through nyāsaḥ, appears in the Vidyap¯īt.ha’s Mādhavakula (Jayadrathayāmala, S. at.ka 4, f. 124r1–5 [Kālikākule p ¯ujānirṇ ayaḥ, vv. 16–22 (fol lowed in Tantrāloka 29.59–63 (TA): parts of a Kashmirian redaction of the text āre cited in Tantrālokaviveka on these verses (TAV)]; the procedure of the ¯ nyāsaḥ is put in Paddhati form in Kālīkulakramārcana, f. 22r5–v5 [KKK]): at.t.ahāsaṁ śikhāsthāne caritraṁca karandhrake | *kulagiryaṁ(corr̥ : kullagirye Coḍ) priye *karṇe (corr̥ : karṇ ṇ aṁ Coḍ) *jayantyā (corr̥ : jayaṁtya Coḍ) *uttare punaḥ (conj.

this Saiva pantheon and its ancillaries intact, the only major deviation being ´ that it has four sites that differ from those in the Niśisaṁcāra. Particularly striking in the Vajraḍāka’s version is not only the fact that it transmits all the details of this distinctively Saiva religious map, which includes such well-known ´ deities as Mahalaks ¯ .mī of Kollagiri (Kolhapur), Hetuka[bhairava] of Dev ¯īkot.t.a, and Vettad¯ . a/Vet ālā of Nagara (P āt¯ .aliputra/Kusumapura),463 but also that it preserves the classification of the goddesses of these sites as belonging to one or other of the families of Rakta, Kar āl¯ī, Caṇ ḍ aks ¯ .ī, Mahocchuṣma, Kar ālā, ¯ Dantura, Bh ¯īmavakta, and Mah ābal ā, information that is revelant only in the ¯ Saiva context, since these are the four Guhyak ´ as and their attendants that form ¯ the inner retinue of Kapal¯īsabhairava and Can ´ . ḍ a Kāpālin ¯ī in the Picumata of the Vidyap¯īt.ha464 and are not encountered to my knowledge in any Buddhist

We therefore have two phonetically related but semantically unrelated names, one meaning the goddess ‘who dwells in the thicket of reeds (vetra-)’ and the other ‘the female Vetala’, ¯ vettāḍ a- and vetāḍ a- being well-attested variant forms of vetāla-. I propose that the latter evolved from the former through a vernacular synonym *Vettalā corresponding to Sanskrit Vetr ālay ā. Cf. Panj āb¯ī and Hindīālā from Skt.ālayaḥ; Panjab¯ī śivālā, Maithilī and Hindī siwālā from Skt. śivālayaḥ; and Panjab¯ī dewālā from Skt. devālayaḥ. The Mahayānist ¯ Mahāsaṁ nipātas ¯utra’s Candragarb has ¯utra, preserved only in a Chinese translation made by Narendrayasas in 566, ´ gives in its 18th chapter (Mahāsaṁ nipātas ¯utra, chapter 55) a listing of the pre siding deities of 55 places extending from India through Central Asia to China (55a–58a [prose]; 59a–60a [verse resume]). The name of the guardian goddess of ´ Pat¯ .aliputra is said there to be Bi-lu-chi or Bi-lu-tuo (LEVI ´ 1905b, p. 265). It is tempting to see this as a deformation of the same name caused by an inadvertent inversion of the last two syllableṣBut I am not qualified to judge the matter̥

Kar ālā, Dantur ā, Bh ¯īmavaktra, and Mah ābal ā:¯ these are respectively their attendant servants’. The Ucchuṣmatantra is the Picumata itself (f. 185r4: ity ucchuṣmatantre picumate nāḍīsaṁcārapat.alaḥṣat.- triṁśatimaḥ). The four secondary goddesses that attend the Guhyakas are also ¯ called their Dut¯īṣI have not emended caṇ ḍākhyāṁ, because although Caṇ ḍ aks ¯ .ī is the standard form of the name there are several other places in this text in which the goddess is called Caṇ ḍ akhy ā.¯ 

465 Both the Niśisaṁcāra and the Vajraḍāka read parvatāgrasamāśritā (rDo rje mkha’ ’gro f. 49r7: ri yi rtse mor brten te gnas) ‘on a hilltop’ here. This is surpris ing because what we expect is a reference to the site’s sacred tree, as in the parallel expression nimbavr̥ kṣasamāśritā ‘by a Nimba tree’ in the next verse. It is tempting to emend, therefore to parpat.āgrasamāśritā ‘in front of a Box [tree]’, since this is so close to the transmitted reading. However, two consid erations oppose this: (1) in a passage on Kollagiri in the ¯ Picumata (f. 7r3–4 [3.84–87]), which agrees in giving Mahalaks ¯ .mī as the goddess, Agnika as the Kṣetrapala, and ¯ daṇ ḍ aḥ as the weapon, the sacred tree of the site is said to be a Vaibhītaka (84 dakṣiṇena likhen mantrī mahāghoraṁ bhayāvaham | mahāraudraṁ śmaśānaṁtu nāmnā kollagirī tathā k 85 tatra daṇ ḍ aṁsamālikhya madhye vaibhıtakadrumam ¯ | nānāvr̥ kṣasamākīrṇ aṁ kollāgiryoparis tathā k 86 citibhiḥ prajvalantībhiḥsamantāt parivāritam | dikṣuś caiva vidikṣuś ca bahis tasya mahāyaśe k 87 tasyādhastāl likhet padmam aṣt.apatraṁsakarṇikam | agnikaṁ kṣetrapālaṁtu mahalaks ¯. mı¯bhayāvaham); and (2) in the Kubjikāmata’s parallel version of this material Mahalaks ¯ .mī is described as ‘residing on a hill’ (22.25: ag-

Moreover, this Buddhist parallel provides additional evidence of the direc tion of redaction through the state of verse 14. For it lacks the first quarter, which contained information vital to the coherence of the passage, namely the name of the site over which the goddess Jvalāmukh ¯ī presides and the goddess of the Picumata to whose family she is assigneḍ As a result of this error, commit ted either by a Buddhist redactor or inherited from a defective Saiva manuscript, ´ what was originally the second quarter has become the first. Aware that the met rical cadences required at the end of first and second quarters of a verse in this metre are different the redactor has removed the resulting metrical blemish by substituting the synonym vikhyātā for viśrutā. But this was not enough, since to mend the unmetrical mess that resulted from the omission he would have had also to recast the quarters that follow. This was evidently beyond his competence or required more effort than he thought necessary. The result is a verse with five quarters (a, a, b, a, b) or one and a half verses of which the first half verse consists of a prior quarter without the posterior quarter required to complete it. 

As for the four sites found in the Vajraḍāka’s version but not in the Niśisaṁcāra, namely Uḍ ḍiyana, J ālandhara, Tibet, and M ālava, there can be ¯ little doubt that the presence of the third is the work of a Buddhist redactor, since Tibet had no religious significance for the Saivas but much for the Bud- ´ dhists from the eight century onwardṣAs for the other three, their presence might be explained by assuming that the direct source of the Vajraḍāka’s passage was not the Niśisaṁcāra as we find it in its single surviving Nepalese manuscript but rather a closely related redaction either within another version of the Niśisaṁcāra, such as we find in the paraphrases and citations of a work of this name in the Tantrāloka of Abhinavagupta and Jayaratha’s commentary,466 

nikena samopetāṁ daṇ ḍ ahastāṁ nagaukasam¯ | kolāgirye mahālakṣmīṁ naumi lakṣmīvivardhanīm). The hypermetrical reading karālar ¯upā in 12c, which was also that of the Tibetan translation (rDo rje mkha’ ’gro f. 49r6: gtsigs pa’i gzugs can), is no doubt an error for kālar ¯upā, echoing karālā in the preceding quarter̥ 

466 See the paraphrase of the Niśisaṁcāra’s treatment of these twenty-four S´ akta ¯ sacred sites in Tantrāloka 15.88–97b and the direct citations in Jayaratha’s commentary on these verseṣThese show a list that differs somewhat from that found in the Nepalese manuscriptṣThe latter has At.t.ahasa, Caritra, ¯

or within some other Saiva source. However, this is improbable in the light ´ of the Vajraḍāka’s treatments of all four of these siteṣFor what they have in common is that they deviate from the pattern of the rest of the passage in that their presiding goddesses, Mahadev ¯ī of Uḍ ḍiyana, Can ¯ . ḍ alin ¯ī of Jalandhara, ¯ Sahaja of Tibet, and Sek ā of M ālava, are not assigned to one or other of the ¯ eight goddesses of the Picumata. Instead, in the case of the first three the redactor has filled in the text at these points by assigning them to the families of Guhya ( ¯ guhyākhyāyonisaṁ bhavā), Soma (somasaṁ bhava), and Svayambhu¯ (svayambhuyonisambhavā), and in the case of the fourth omitting to assign her to any deity.467 Why he chose these names is unknown to me. Only one is a goddess and not one of them is of any significance in Tantric Buddhism, unless the Svayambhu intended is that of the famous Svayambh ¯ ucaitya of Kathmandu. ¯ It seems likely that he supplied these names at random in order to maintain the compositional structure. In any case, since it would have been an easy task to insert names from among those of the eight goddesses that structure his Saiva ´ source, it is evident that they meant nothing to hiṁ 

The other list of sacred places appears in Laghuśaṁ vara 41.6–15. The verses first list these places (6–8b) and then state the classes of Yoginīs and other female supernaturals said to be present in them, though without covering them all.468 The Saiva source, or rather a later redactional variant of it, is seen ´ in the following passage in the Tantrasadbhāva: 

Kolagiri, Jayant ¯ī, Ujjayinī, Prayaga, Varan ¯ . a, and Kot ¯īvarṣa (/Devīkot.t.a) (the eight Kṣetras); Viraja, Eruḍī, Hatapura, Elapura, Gokarn ¯ . a, Marukesvara, Na- ´ gara (Pat¯ .aliputra), and Puṇ ḍravardhana (the eight Saṁ dohas); and Parastīra, Pr̥ṣt.hapura, Kuṇ ḍī, Choṣmara, Ks ¯ .īrika, Mayāpur ¯ī, Amr ātike ¯ svara, and R ´ ajagr ¯ .ha (the eight Upakṣetras). The list in the redaction known to Abhinavagupta and Jayaratha has Prayaga, Varan ¯ . a, At ¯ .t.ahasa, Jayant ¯ī, Varān¯ . asī, Kalinga, Kul ˙ utā,ānd Lahul ā (the eight Ks ¯ .etras); Viraja, Erud ¯ .ī, Halā, El āpura, Ks ¯ .īrapurī, Na gara, Mayāpur ¯ī, and Marudesa (the eight Sam ´ . dohas); and Jalandhara, Nep āla, ¯ Kasm´īra, Gargika, Hara, Mlecchadigdv āravr ¯ .tti, Kurukṣetra, and Khet.aka (the eight Upasaṁ dohas). It is striking that this introduces a number of Himalayan re gions, namely Kulutā (Kulu), L āhul ā (Lahul), Nep āla, Ka ¯ sm´īra, and also Gargika,¯ if that refers to Garhwal. Mlecchadigdvaravr ¯ .tti ‘the pass (?) to the region of the barbarians’ is also likely to refer to a location in the Himalaya or Hindu Kusḥ 

467 Vajraḍāka f. 43r1–2 (18.43): *oḍ yāyane *mahādevī (corr̥ : mahādevi Coḍ) guhyākhyāyonisaṁ bhavā | vajraśr̥ṅkhaladharā devyā sughorā divyar ¯upiṇī; f. 43r2–3 (18.45): jālandhare tu caṇ ḍālinī j ñeyā mudra kat.t.ārikodyatā | soma sambhava mahādevi sarvaiśvarya*pradāyikā (eṁ : dāyikā Coḍ); f. 43r7–v1 (18.55): bhot.aviṣaye sahajākhyā makaradhvajadhāriṇī | svayambhuyonisambhavā saumyāsyā divyar ¯upiṇī; f. 43v1–2 (18.57): mālave tu tathā sekā mudrāmud gara*dhāriṇī (corr̥ : dhāraṇī Coḍ) | sādhakānāṁ *priyā (corr̥ : prayā Coḍ) nityaṁ †jasasvini prasāsyāḥ†syuḥ. 

468 A related system of thirty-two sacred sites is taught in Hevajra 1.6.10–19, and, with some differences, in Mahāmudrātilaka, Pat.ala 10 (ff. 17v1–20v5).

then that his text mentioned only Oḍ ḍiyana and J ālandhara in addition to the ¯ twenty-one of the Saiva source. Jayabhadra does not cite the actual wording ´

śauṇ ḍinī khaṇ ḍ arohā cakravegā khagānanā k 2 haya*karṇā (corr̥ : varṇ ṇā Coḍ) subhadrā ca *śyāmādevī (corr̥ : syāmāthavī Coḍ) tathaiva ca | surābhakṣī vāyuvegā tathā mahābhairavā k 3 airāvatī drumacchāyā laṅkeśvarī kharvarī tathā | vīramatī mahānāsā prabhāvatī caiva caṇ ḍākṣī pracaṇ ḍā ca sādhakaḥk 4 etāḥsiddhās tu vai p ¯urvaṁcaturviṁśati ḍākinyaḥ. This list too has parallels in the Vidyap¯īt.ha, though I have found only partial matcheṣThus the Yoginīsaṁcāra of Jayadrathayāmala, S. at.ka 3, gives the following list of twenty-four Yoginīs whose names when ut tered draw in the Sma ´ s´anabh ¯ utas (f. 202r5–7 [9.58–61]): ¯ śarabhān<an>ā suvırā¯ ca vajribhā *rāsabhā (conj. : rāsibhā Coḍ) tathā | *cakravartı¯ (corr̥ : cakravarti Coḍ) ca *saun ´. ḍı¯ (eṁ : pauṇ ḍī Coḍ) ca khaḍ gakarṇā mahātapā k 59 cakravega¯ mahāyāmyā subhadra¯ gajakarṇikā | carā vai somadevī ca gavākṣī vayuvegag ā¯ k 60 airavat ¯ ı mah ānāsā¯ daṁṣt.rālī ca sukarkaśā | vedhanī ca tathā bhat.t.ā droṇā kākenakā tathā k 61 yatra nāmāni yogīnām uccāryante mahātape | tatra śmaśānabh ¯utāś ca sāṁ nidhyaṁ yā<n>ti tatkṣaṇāt. The eight names in bold char acters are those that are among the twenty-four of the Laghuśaṁ vara. Compare also the names Sarabh ´ anan ā, Khad ¯ . gakarṇ a, Gajakarn ¯ .ika, and Somadev ¯ī with the Laghuśaṁ vara’s Khaganan ā, Hayakarn ¯ . a, and ¯ Sy´ amādev ¯ī. The names of four of the Laghuśaṁ vara’s D. akin ¯īs are found among the fourteen inner goddesses of the Picumata, i.e., the four Guhyakas, their four D ¯ utis, and the six Yogin ¯īs, namely Caṇ ḍ aks ¯ .ī (the third Guhyaka), Mah ābal ā (the fourth D ¯ ut¯ī), and Cakravega and ¯ Mahanāsā (the fifth and sixth Yogin ¯īs). For the first eight see 4.254c–256 cited here p. 193. For the six Yoginīs see f. 19r3 (4.257): kroṣt.ukī vijayā caiva gajakarṇā mahāmukhī | cakravega mah ānāsā¯ ṣaḍ yoginyaḥ prakīrtitāḥ. Suvırāāppears in Kubjikāmata 21.45c and Matasāra f. 138r1, Khaganan āās one of the eight S´ aktasiddh ās of the K āl¯īkula/Krama, Lanke ˙ svar ´ ı¯ in Matasāra f. 81r1 as one of eight Yoginīs in a variant of the inner retinue of the Picumata, and Prabhavat ¯ ı¯ in Kubjikāmata 11.115a and 12.23b. 

473 See here p.158. Kan¯ . ha, Yogaratnamālā on Hevajra 1.7.12, identifies Pullīramalaya with Purn ¯ . agiri and that appears in its place in listings of these sacred places in later texts of the Cakrasaṁ vara cycle, as in Saṁ varodaya 9.14. In the treatment of the thirty-two sacred sites of the Hevajra system in the tenth Pat.ala of the Mahāmudrātilaka we find Purn ¯ . agiri and Pullīra denoting the same place (f. 17r5– v1: oḍiyānaṁ pīt.hamākhyātaṁ pīt.haṁjālandharaṁsmr̥tam | pīt.haṁ purn ¯. agiris´ caiva kāmar ¯upaṁtathaiva ca . . . f. 18r1–2: śirasi sthitaṁ vajrapīt.haṁśikhāyāṁ jādisaṁj ñitam | pullıram ¯. mastake j ñeyaṁ bhr ¯umadhye kāmar ¯upakam). On the location of Purn ¯ . agiri, in the Deccan, see SANDERSON 2007a, pp. 298–299. In S´ akta ¯ Saiva sources it is one of the principal P ´īt.has and is often referred to, but never under the name Pullīramalaya/Pullīra. 

[[200]]

the names of these two places to fill a whole line (8cd).474 The later reading, oḍ ḍiyānajālandharapullīramayādiṣu, attested by the Tibetan translation and by the lemmata in the commentaries of Bhavyakīrti and Bhavabhat.t.a, supplies the missing Pullīramalaya and, incidentally, is an almost metrical half-verse: its first half (oḍ ḍiyānajālandhara) is unmetrical, but the second is not, and together they provide the required total of sixteen syllableṣAs for the meaning of the in sertion, ordinary usage suggests that it is ‘Oḍ ḍiyana, J ālandhara, Pull ¯īramalaya, and others’. But that would not sit well with the closed list of twenty-four Yo ginīs to which the sacred places were required to corresponḍ Thus it has been interpreted by Bhavabhat.t.a to mean ‘beginning with Oḍ ḍiyana, J ālandhara, and ¯ Pullīramalaya’, this compound with its locative plural ending being read as qual ifying the twenty-one sites, each listed in the common text with actual or virtual locative singular endingṣThus we have twenty-four Yoginīs in twenty-four siteṣAll that was needed to make this fit the system known to the commentators was to claim that the Laghuśaṁ vara is deliberately concealing the true order of the items, both the names of the Yoginīs in Pat.ala 4475 and the names of the sacred sites in Pat.ala 41. For in their system that order is not Oḍ ḍiyana, J ālandhara, ānd Pullīramalaya followed by the twenty-one from Kuluta to Arbuda, as the ¯ Laghuśaṁ vara itself indicates, but the added three in reverse order followed by the twenty-one in reverse order, with the order of the Yoginīs also reversed, so that the true sequence is from Pracaṇ ḍ a in Pull ¯īramalaya to Mahav¯īrya in Ar- ¯ buda.476 

474 The frequent deviations from correct metrical form in this corpus create the im pression that the redactors were largely indifferent to this aspect of composition, happily inserting and deleting without feeling the need to rewrite the result to con form to the rules of the Anuṣt.ubh metre. The alternative, that they lacked not the inclination but the ability to do so, seems to me less likely. In the texts of the Saiva Vidy ´ ap¯īt.ha, even when the Sanskrit is of a register well below that of the learned, the metrical structure is generally sounḍ Indeed since we find forms from both learned and scriptural (Aisa) registers used in the same texts it seems that by ´ drawing on both the redactors were not only asserting that their compositions were divine rather than human utterances but also making the task of metrical compo sition easier for themselves by using an Aisa form that fitted the metre when the ´ Paninian would not, as, for example, in the case of the not infrequent use of Aisa´ genitives plural in -ām in place of the Paninian -ānāṁ

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Most of the few other differences between the version in Laghuśaṁ vara 41 and that seen in the Saiva source are of little significance. But there is ´ 

one that is more revealing. The Tantrasadbhāva has Sthala between Kosala and Trisakuni (16.62c–63b: ´ kā ñcyāṁlampākaviṣaye kaliṅge kauśale sthale | triśakunis tathā cauḍre kāmar ¯upe ca mālave), whereas the Laghuśaṁ vara lacks it (41.7: kā ñcyāṁlampākaviṣaye kaliṅge c[aiva] kosale | triśakunis tathā oḍre kāmar ¯upe [ca] mālave), and instead between Sauras¯ .t.ra and Pre tapurī has Gr̥hadevata (41.6: ¯ kulatāyāṁ araṇ ye ca sindhudeśe nagareśvare | suvarṇ advīpe saurāṣt.re tatha ca gr ¯. hadevata¯ pretapuryāṁ himālaye), which the Tantrasadbhāva lacks (16.61c–62b: kul ¯utāyām araṇ yeśe sindhudeśe nageśvare | samudrakukṣyāṁsaurāṣt.re pretapuryāṁ himālaye). Two features are immediately obvious here. The first is that the additional words tathā ca gr̥hadevatā have been added to an otherwise metrically correct verse with the result that it has five Padas rather than the required four, with the fourth and ¯ fifth both with the cadence restricted to the second and fourth Padas of the ¯ Anuṣt.ubh, thus crudely violating the required metrical alternation of evenly and unevenly numbered Padas that is hallmark of this metre. The second is that ¯ Gr̥hadevata, meaning ‘household deity’ is a most implausible place name. The ¯ key to the mistake, which became a permanent part of the ritual system of the Cakrasaṁ vara cycle, is in the second part of the passage in the version of the Tantrasadbhāva, which tells the reader the classes of supernaturals that are present in the sacred siteṣFor there gr̥hadevatāḥ‘household deities’ are said to be present in Sauras¯ .t.ra in a verse in which the items Sauras¯ .t.ra, gr̥hadevatāḥ, and Pretapurī are stated in that order (16.66c–67b: samudrakukṣyāṁ kāmpilyas sauras¯.t.re gr̥ hadevatah¯.| pretapuryam¯. mahākālyo r ¯upiṇ yo himavadgirau ‘In Samudrakukṣī Kampil ¯īs, in Sauras¯ .t.ra Gr̥hadevatas, in Pretapur ¯ī Mahakāl¯īs, in Himalaya R ¯ upin ¯ .īs’). Evidently the redactor has read the sequence saurāṣt.re gr̥hadevatāḥ pretapuryāṁ as though these were three sites rather than one site followed by its resident supernaturals and another site. Probably his manuscript read gr̥hadevatā rather than gr̥hadevatāḥ and he took it as a stem-form to be un derstood as locative, a licence of kind seen elsewhere in both the Laghuśaṁ vara and its Saiva sources, as, apparently, in the unmetrical insertion that this ´ 

error prompted: suvarṇ advīpe saurāṣt.re tathā ca gr̥ hadevata¯ pretapuryāṁ himālaye. Bhavabhat.t.a duly comments on the occurrence of gr̥hadevatā in that

The direction of redaction is also unmistakeable in the passage of the 

Laghuśaṁ vara (1.15–4.1) (B) that prescribes the ritual of initiatioṇ This has evidently been redacted on the basis a Saiva source of which an expanded variant ´

Here we see several tell-tale signṣIn the Buddhist version the disciples undergoing the initiation are referred to as putrakāḥ(3.4ab: saṁcchādya pat.avastreṇ a mukhaṁteṣāṁtu putrakāṁ‘Having covered the faces of those disciples with a piece of cloth’), a term that is standard in this technical sense in the Saiva literature but to my knowledge appears with it nowhere else in ´ Buddhist Tantric sourceṣ

In 2.15 the installation of the main deity in the centre of the initiation Maṇ ḍ ala is described as follows: karṇikāyāṁ nyased vīraṁ mahābhairava bhīṣaṇ am ‘On the pericarp [at the centre of the lotus diagram] he should install the terrifying Vīra Mahabhairava’. The ¯ Saiva version (8.10cd) has ´tasya madhye 

nyased devi bhairavaṁ bhīmavikramam ‘O Devī, in the centre of that [lotus] he should install Bhairava of terrible might’. But for this parallel we might have been tempted to read the Buddhist version not as mahābhairava bhīṣaṇ aṁ, with mahābhairava as a stem-form substituted for the accusative mahābhairavaṁ for metrical convenience, a common licence in this register of the language, but as mahābhairavabhīṣaṇ am, preferring a pleonasm ‘most frightening [and] terrible’ to a reading that shows the name of the deity of the Vidyap¯īt.ha, a clear sign of incomplete assimilatioṇ 

The Saiva text follows this with ´tasyāgrataḥsthitāṁ devīm aghorāṁ ghoravikramām | bhairavābhimukhīṁ kruddhāṁraudrar ¯upāṁ nyaset tataḥ ‘Then he should install the goddess Aghora of frightening might standing before ¯ him, facing Bhairava, furious and of terrible aspect’. The Buddhist version first inserts a description of some of the male deity’s iconographic features and then returns to redact its Saiva exemplar as follows: ´tasyāgrataḥsthitāṁ devīṁ vajravārāhīṁsughorām | mahābhairavābhimukhāṁ kr̥tvā tu trinetrīṁ raudrar ¯upiṇīm ‘[and] the most frightening goddess Vajravarāh¯ī standing be fore him, three-eyed, of terrible aspect, making her face Mahabhairava’. The ¯ Buddhist name of Heruka’s consort has been inserted but the redactor has not troubled to do the same for Heruka, leaving the Saiva name unchangeḍ The ´ accessible Sanskrit manuscript does give the name of Heruka here, reading śrīherukābhimukhāṁ kr̥tvā tu, and this reading is supported by the commenta tors Bhavabhat.t.a (śrīherukābhimukhāṁ kr̥tvā) and Indrabhuti ( ¯ he ru ka dpal ye shes phyogs ni [*śrīherukaj ñānābhimukha-]), and the Tibetan translation (he ru ka dpal che la phyogs [*mahāśrīherukābhimukha-]). But it is certain that this is a later improvement, because mahābhairavābhimukhāṁ kr̥tvā tu is what we find in the older redaction attested in Jayabhadra’s commentary, and in the text as incorporated in the Abhidhānottara (mahābhairavābhimukhīṁ). It is also supported by the commentary on the later form of the Laghuśaṁ vara by Vīravajra, who gives rab ’jigs byed che la phyogs ‘facing Mahabhairava’ here. ¯

Further, in most places where a Buddhist imprint is visible the text be comes unmetrical. This is most economically explained by the hypothesis stated above477 that what we are seeing is a Saiva source after its redaction by a Bud- ´ dhist with little concern for metrical accuracy.478 

Finally, the Laghuśaṁ vara’s account of initiation is remarkably un Buddhist in its content. This is not so much because it adheres so closely to the structure and detail of the ceremony outlined in the Yoginīsaṁcāra, including such distinctive details as the pitching of the lines of the Maṇ ḍ ala with a cord soaked with human blood and made from the hair or sinews of a corpse (2.11), the use of such substances as the five nectars of the body (pa ñcāmr̥tam) and the ash and powdered charcoal of cremation pyres on the ground of the Maṇ ḍ ala (2.1–3),479 the beating of a drum in its worship (3.2–3), and the marking of the 

477 See here p. 190. 

478 See 2.4ab: samyagj ñānatantraj ñaḥśrīherukamantraj ñaḥ; 2.13d: yajed ḍākinījālaśaṁ varam; and 3.7a: śrīherukādipīt.ha darśayet. The reading mahābhairavābhimukhāṁ kr̥tvā tu (2.18a) probably represents a first attempt to differentiate the Buddhist version from its metrical Saiva prototype by adding ´ mahā-. 

479 This substitution of inauspicious and dangerous substances in the preparation of the Maṇ ḍ ala is a marked feature of accounts of initiation found in Vidyap¯īt.ha textṣSee, e.g., Picumata f. 5v1 (3.12ab), concerning the Aghorīmaṇ ḍ ala): asthi c ¯urṇ atadaṅgāraiḥ mantraj ñoālikhet puram ‘The mantra-master should draw the Maṇ ḍ ala with powdered bone and charred bone’; f. 5v6 (3.31ab): śmaśānotthena s ¯utreṇ a s ¯utrakāryaṁtu kārayet ‘He should do the outlining with a cord from the cremation ground’; f. 10r2–3 (3.184–185): śmaśānotthāni bhāṇ ḍāni vas tras ¯utrādikāni tu | vastrai<r> dhvajā tu kartavyā s ¯utreṇ a karaṇī tathā k keśair darbhā<n> yathānyāyam *acchinnāgrān (corr̥ : acchinnāgrāḥ Coḍ) prakalpayet | veṣt.ayen maṇ ḍ alaṁtais tu astrajaptaiḥsamantataḥ‘The vases, cloths and cords should be made with what has come from cremation groundṣWith [funeral] shrouds he should make the banners and with threads [therefrom] the pitch ing corḍ With the hair [of corpses] he should provide the uncut-ended stems of [protective] Darbha grasṣAfter empowering them with the weapon[-mantra] he should surround the maṇ ḍ ala with them’; Jayadrathayāmala, S. at.ka 4, f. 65v7 (Rāviṇīyāgapat.ala, [concerning the Maṇ ḍ ala of Ravin ¯ .ī in the Kālīkula section of the Jayadrathayāmalatantra], v. 101cd: śavas ¯utreṇ a saṁs ¯utrya asthic ¯urṇādibhir likhet ‘He should colour [the Maṇ ḍ ala] with powdered [human] bone and the like after pitching its lines with a corpse-cord’; Jayadrathayāmala, S. at.ka 3, f. 200r5– 6: s ¯utrayed rudhirāktena *śavas ¯utreṇ a (corr̥ : ṣavas ¯utreṇ a Coḍ) ‘He should outline the Maṇ ḍ ala with a corpse-cord smeared with blood’. The nature of this cord is indicated by Kṣemaraja on ¯ Svacchandatantra 13.21b: mr̥tas ¯utreṇ a vakṣyamāṇ acchummakāyuktyā mr̥tasnāyunā ‘The expression ‘with a corpse-thread’ means ‘with the sinew of a corpse’ in accordance with the secret vocabulary to be taught below’. He refers here to Svacchandatantra 15.5: snāyuḥs ¯utraṁ prakīrtitam ‘The word cord means sinew’. This understanding is also seen in Bud dhist Tantric literature. In his commentary (-piṇ ḍārthat.īkā) on the Hevajratantra Vajragarbha glosses śmaśānas ¯utreṇ a ‘cremation ground cord’ as ro’i rgyus pa rnams kyis byas pa’i srang bus ‘a cord made from the sinews of a [human] corpse’ (SNELL GROVE 1959, Pt. 1, p. 51, ṇ1, who mistranslates this to refer to ‘a thread made

foreheads of the candidates with human blood (3.8).480 It is more because the redactor has not added what from the time of the Mahāvairocanābhisaṁ bodhi onwards had been the most marked characteristic of the Mantranaya’s adap tation of Saiva Man ´. ḍ ala initiation, namely the series of consecrations known as abhiṣekaḥ. The commentators evidently could not accept that this crucial Buddhist signature might be absent. For they have resorted to strained exegesis in order to impose it. Jayabhadra claims that the terse injunction to worship the Mudra in 3.7 alludes to the ¯ guhyābhiṣekaḥ, in which the Guru unites with a consort (mudrā) and the candidate swallows the semeṇ Then avoiding the difficult task of reading in allusions to any of the six consecrations that normally preceded this climactic act in his time he simply asserts that they should be done following the procedure familiar from other Tantraṣ481 Bhavabhat.t.a, however, adopts a more bold and imaginative strategy, finding all seven con 

from the guts of a corpse’). We also read of the use of the hair of corpses for this purpose: Jayadrathayāmala, S. at.ka 3, f. 181r4:ālikhen maṇ ḍ alavaraṁtato raudreṇ a bhasmanā | prathamaṁs ¯utrayitvā tu śavam ¯urdhajarajjunā ‘He should draw the excellent Maṇ ḍ ala with human ash after first pitching its lines with a cord of corpse-hair’; Siddhayogeśvarīmata 8.8: narakeśasamutthena karpāsādimayena vā | s ¯utrayen maṇ ḍ alaṁ divyaṁsarvasiddhiphalodayam ‘He should trace the ex cellent Maṇ ḍ ala, which bestows the reward of all the Siddhis, with [a cord] made from human hair or from fibres such as cotton’. This option is no doubt fixed: cremation-ground substances for ascetics and conventional substances for house holders; see, e.g., Jayadrathayāmala, S. at.ka 2 f. 9v2 (Vāmeśvarīyāgapat.ala, vv. 48c–49): vāmāmr̥tādibhir lipya tatra maṇ ḍ alamālikhet k rajobhir *vīramārgasthaś (eṁ : vīramārgasthaiś Coḍ) *cityaṅgārādibhasmabhiḥ(cityaṅgārādi conj. : cityāṅgārādi Codac : citāṅgārādi Codpc) | ratnādiśālijātaiś ca gr̥hasthaś cālikhet tataḥ‘Having smeared [the ground] with wine and the like he should draw the Maṇ ḍ ala upon it with powders such as the charcoal and ash of funeral pyres, if he follows the path of Heroes, and with [ground] precious stones or rice flour [etc.], if he is a housholder’. 

480 Both versions say only that this is to be done ‘with blood’ (raktena). But a variant specifying human blood (mahāraktena) is attested by the Tibetan translation (mt shal chen gsum lan bzlas pa yis [mahāraktena trijaptena]) and the commentators Durjayacandra (mtshal chen lan gsum brzlas pa yis), Vīravajra (iḍ), and Indrabhuti ¯ (mtshal chen ni). 

481 Jayabhadra, Cakrasaṁ varapa ñjikā, p. 114, ll. 9–11: kulaṁtasya vinirdiśed (3.6) itiparyantaṁsukaram eva | tadanantaraṁtantrānantaraprasiddhena vidhinā sar vam abhiṣekaṁ nivartyedānīṁ guhyābhiṣekavidhipradhānatvāt p ¯ujayen mudrām (3.7) ityādinā guhyābhiṣekaṁs ¯ucayati ‘The text up to ‘he should indicate his Fam ily’ is easy. He now alludes to the guhyābhiṣekaḥ with the words beginning ‘he should worship the Mudra’. He does so because this is the most important [of the ¯ consecrations]. [It is should be understood that] ‘he should worship the Mudra [i.e. ¯ the consort] after he has completed the whole consecration [process that should be performed] immediately after that [determining of the candidate’s Family by cast ing the flower] following the procedure that is well known from other Tantras’. The expression ‘the whole consecration’, though singular, should be understood to refer to the whole sequence of the consecrations that precede the guhyābhiṣekaḥ.

secrations up to and including the guhyābhiṣekaḥin 3.2–3.3a.: ghaṇt.ānādamālambya puṣpadh ¯upair alaṁ kr̥tām | ghaṇt.āṁ vādayet susvarāṁ pat.ahikām vāpi sādhakaḥ| hāhākāraṁca kārayet ‘Resorting to the resonance of the bell the Sadhaka should ring the bell after it has been adorned with flowers and ¯ [fumigated with] incense; or he may [beat] a druṁ He should also laugh wildly’. He asks us to accept that the ringing of the bell refers to the consecration of [the giving of] the bell (ghant.ābhiṣekaḥ)482 and, more astonishingly, that the wild laughter enjoined, literally ‘the sound hā hā’, is the consecration of [the giving of the initiatory] name (nāmābhiṣekaḥ).483 Having conjured up these two consecrations he then asserts that the three that precede them are therefore implicitly intended, namely the consecration with water (udakābhiṣekaḥ), the consecration with the crown (makut.ābhiṣekaḥ), and the consecration with the Vajra (vajrādhipatyabhiṣekaḥ).484 He then subjects this same passage to a second reading in order to force it to refer also to the two consecrations that follow these five: theācāryābhiṣekaḥ, which qualifies the initiate to officiate as a Vajracārya, and the consecration of the secret ( ¯ guhyābhiṣekaḥ). He claims that in this second reading the resonance of the bell, the ringing of the bell, and the beating of the drum refer to the Guru’s uniting for the purpose of the second of these consecrations with a girl of twenty-five, twelve, or sixteen respectively.485 

482 Bhavabhat.t.a, Cakrasaṁ varapa ñjikā, p. 37, l. 17: ghaṇt.ānādam ityādinā ghaṇt.ā bhiṣekaḥ pratipādyate ‘The passage beginning with ghaṇt.ānādam teaches the con secration of the bell’. 483 Bhavabhat.t.a, Cakrasaṁ varapa ñjikā p. 38, ll. 6–7: hāhākāraṁca kārayed iti | hāhākāro nāmābhiṣekaḥ| taṁ gurubhat.t.ārakenātmanaḥ kārayet ‘In the expression “He should have the hāhākāraḥ done”, the hāhākāraḥis the consecration of the

[[210]]

Having made the text refer to the guhyābhiṣekaḥ, he finds theācāryābhiṣekaḥ by using the same argument that he had employed to arrive at the full sequence of the five consecrations that precede it, namely that its presence is entailed by the supposed reference to the guhyābhiṣekaḥ, because that requires it as its antecedent.486 He finds a reference to the final consecration that he needed to discover here, that of wisdom (praj ñābhiṣekaḥ), in the statement in 3.7 that Jayabhadra had taken to allude to the preceding guhyābhiṣekaḥ: tataḥ p ¯ujayen mudrāmācāryaḥsusamāhitaḥ‘Then the Acārya, fully concentrated, should ¯ worship the Mudra’. If, as is highly probable, the consecration understood by ¯ Bhavabhat.t.a here was the praj ñāj ñānābhiṣekaḥ of the initiation manuals, then there would appear to a problem, because the active agent in that consecration was not the Acārya but the candidate, who now unites with the consort himself. ¯ 

Bhavabhat.t.a is very terse at this point but it is likely that he was attempting to remove this difficulty when he wrote that the text refers to the agent as Acārya ¯ 

here because he is endowed with such qualities as self-control. I take him to mean that it is indeed the candidate rather than the officiant that is the agent here and that he is referred as an officiant only figuratively, because he has all the qualities that are required of an officiant.487 These readings are, of course, 

bell is [a women of] the Vajra Family, the bell [one of] the Jewel Family, the drum [one of] the Lotus Family, and the wild laughter [one of] the Tathagata Family. The ¯ word ‘and’ [in ‘and he should laugh wildly’ indicates [one of] the other [Family, that of Action]. The officiant should have intercourse with one or other of these women of whom the first is ‘the resonance of the bell’. The meaning is [also] that the Sadhaka, ¯ [that is to say,] the candidate, should make, that is to say, utter, ‘the resonance of the bell’, that is to say, the Mantra AHO SUKHA [‘Oh, Bliss’]. He [also] tells us that after which [he should utter this Mantra] in the passage [of this Tantra] that begins with anāmā-. At this point one must read in the following verse (1.12c–13a) ‘The master of Yoga should always lick [it, taking it] with the tips of his ring finger and thumb. Having relished it as though it were a draught of Soma he attains eternal success’. So there is another sense of this [verse], namely that the officiant should make the candidate take into his mouth [lit. ‘lick’] the product of his sexual union with the aforesaid consort with the tips of his ring finger and thumb; and that can didate, having relished it like a draught of Soma attains Siddhi. This, then, is the guhyābhiṣekaḥ’. 

486 Bhavabhat.t.a, Cakrasaṁ varapa ñjikā, p. 38, ll. 23–24: sa ca śiṣyaḥtataḥ somapānavadāsvādya siddhimāpnotīti guhyābhiṣeko ’yam | ata evācāryābhiṣekaḥ siddhaḥtatp ¯urvakatvāt tasya ‘This is the guhyābhiṣekaḥ. This itself establishes the presence of theācāryābhiṣekaḥ, because the former is preceded by the latter’. 

487 Bhavabhat.t.a, Cakrasaṁ varapa ñjikā, p. 39, ll. 21–22: tata ityādinā praj ñābhiṣekaṁ darśayati | tato guhyābhiṣekānantaram |ācārya iti dhairyādiguṇ ayogāt ‘In the pas sage beginning tataḥ he reveals the Wisdom Consecratioṇ The word tataḥ(‘next’) means directly after the guhyābhiṣekaḥ. He is termed the officiant [here] because he has such qualities as self-control’. Bhavabhat.t.a is probably alluding to the qual ities of the good Acārya as stated in vv. 8–9 of the ¯ Gurupa ñcāśikā: dhīro vinīto matimān kṣamāvānārjavo ’śat.haḥ| . . . .

artificial and could be imposed on the text only because Bhavabhat.t.a, like Jayabhadra, could not accept the possibility that there might be no reference to the consecrations in a Buddhist Tantra’s treatment of initiatioṇ 

Further exemplification of the direction of redaction can be seen in the first of the new parallels listed above, that on the subject of the regular rite of wor shipping the Kulika (as the ¯ Laghuśaṁ vara has it). For ease of comparison I give in bold characters those parts of each of the three related texts, the Picumata, the Herukābhyudaya, and the Laghuśaṁ vara, that partly or completely corre spond to passages in one or both of the other two. The Picumata passage is as follows:

The related passage in the Herukābhyudaya is accessible only in its Tibetan translatioṇ I give that here with a reconstruction of the Sanskrit of the parts 

488 I propose this emendation for two reasonṣThe first is that the reading contradicts information given later in this chapter̥ According to that there are three grades of flesh for use in the preparation of the sacrament (caruḥ): goat, cow, and humaṇ The first is said to be inferior (adhama-), the second intermediate (madhyama-), and the third superior (uttama-): adhamaṁcchāgam ity uktaṁ madhyamaṁ gobhavaṁ bhavet | puruṣottamaṁ mahādevi tridhā tu caravaḥsmr̥tāḥ(f. 320r5–v1 [84.36c– 37b]). Consequently without this emendation we have nonsense: ‘with the inferior [i.e. goat], the superior [i.e. human], and goat’. With it we have a statement that is consistent with this classification: ‘with the intermediate [i.e. cow], the superior [i.e. human] and [the inferior, i.e.] goat. The second reason is that the emendation has the support of the Buddhist parallels, which, as we shall see, read madhyamot tomaśvāsena or madhyamottamocchvāsena here.

The Herukābhyudaya, then, shows a version that is closer than the [[213]]Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Laghuśaṁ vara to the text of the Picumata in some details and covers more of it. It is particularly striking that it preserves the Picumata’s vat.ikāṁ prāśayet prāj ñaḥ p ¯ujākāle viśeṣataḥ(84.12ab), reading rtag tu ril bu bza’ par bya | mchod pa’i dus kyi bye brag la ‘Let him always swallow the sacramental pellet, especially at the time of worship’, diverging from the Picumata only in having nityam (rtag tu) and p ¯ujākālaviśeṣataḥ where that has prāj ñaḥ and p ¯ujākāle viśeṣataḥ. That the Sanskrit read vat.ikāṁis shown by the gloss vat.ikāṁ prāśya in the Herukābhyudayapa ñjikā (f. 3v6). 

Even so it shows signs of having had difficulty in understanding some of the Saiva proto-text’s technical terms and of having dealt with this difficulty by ´ resorting to rewriting. Thus in 15.10 me tog gcig dang yang dag ldan ‘together with a single flower’ corresponds to bukapuṣpasamanvitam ‘together with the Buka flower’ in Picumata 84.16, so that the Sanskrit may be restored from the Tibetan with some confidence as ekapuṣpasamanvitaṁ The context is a listing of impure ingredients to be consumed at the time of practice. Now, ‘a single flower’ yields no appropriate sense in this context, whereas ‘Buka flower’ (bukapuṣpam) doeṣFor the Picumata tells us that in its secret vocabulary bukam means ‘the impurity of the male organ’ (84.38a: buko liṅgamalo j ñeyas; 87.196d: bukaṁliṅgamalaṁsmr̥tam), and the Kubjikāmata tells us that bukapuṣpam has the same meaning (25.226ab: bukapuṣpa kaṇākhyaṁca liṅgapaṅkamalaṁtathā). It is probable that the Buddhist redactor, failing to understand this obscure term, modified the text to produce something that had at least the appearance of sense. Kumaracandra confirms the reading ¯ ekapuṣpa in his Herukābhyudayapa ñjikā and ventures to explain it as ‘the blood of a [woman’s] first menstruation’: ekapuṣpaṁ prathamaṁrajaḥ vajrapadmābhyāṁ sādhyamānaṁ kapālasthaṁ(p. 156) ‘[After putting it] in a skull-bowl [he should swallow] the ‘one flower’, i.e. the first menses, produced by the penis and vagina’. But this gloss is not only strained: it also leads the text into an implausible repetition, since the blood of first menstruation has just been mentioned in 15.10a, in the term rang byung me tog (= svayambhukusumam). He also seems not to have understood the expression kuṇ ḍ agolodbhava- seen in Picumata 84.15c (kuṇ ḍ agolodbhavenaiva), another ‘secret’ Vidyap¯īt.ha term, referring to the mingled ejaculateṣHe resolves his quandary by substituting the name of his deity, the Tibetan dpal ldan he ru ka las byung (15.9d) evidently rendering śrīherukodbhavaṁ 

In the abbreviated version seen in the Laghuśaṁ vara we have kulikāṁ p ¯ujayen nityaṁ‘let him constantly worship the Kulika’ in place of the reading ¯ vat.ikāṁ prāśayen nityam seen in the Herukābhyudaya and in the Saiva proto- ´ text. This is evidently the result of a corruption of a redaction which read not 

[[214]]

vat.ikāṁ but the exact synonym gulikāṁ;489 and this hypothesis is confirmed by the Abhidhānottara, which in its own first chapter preserves gulikāṁin a pas sage modelled on these verses of the Laghuśaṁ vara, thus bearing witness to a stage of the redaction of this text that is earlier even than that known to our ear liest commentator, since Jayabhadra accords with all later witnesses in reading kulikāṁ here:

The otherwise unattested kulikāṁ was then construed by force to mean yoginīṁ ‘a/the Yoginī’, and the verb prāśayet ‘let him swallow’, since it now made no sense, altered to p ¯ujayet ‘let him worship’.491 

489 For gulikā (variant forms: gut.ikā and guḍikā) see here p. 217. 

490 The reading of 11c is further supported by the Tibetan translation: mkhas pas dril bur byas nas ni. Note that dhīmān (mkhas pas) here is synonymous with prāj ñaḥ found at the corresponding point in the version seen in the Picumata (vat.ikāṁ prāśayet prāj ñaḥ). This, then, has probably survived from the Saiva source on ´ which the first Buddhist version drew.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

That the Buddhist versions arose from Saiva prototypes is clear from the ´ detailed analysis of these and many other parallelṣOther features reinforce this conclusioṇ In all cases the Saiva passages fit neatly into the contexts in ´ which they occur, without ragged edges, as it were, at their beginning and end, whereas this is often not so with the parallels in the Buddhist texts, a circum stance that fits well with a scenario in which the latter where constructed by a rather careless process of extraction, insertion, and superficial editing. 

The same is suggested by the high degree of divergence between the various Buddhist commentators in their attempts to tell us what these new texts meaṇ They were caught out, as it were, by new materials that lacked roots in the Buddhist textual corpus in which they were traineḍ They did their best to make sense of what were in many cases barely intelligible passages; but without much guidance from existing Buddhist sources and with no central authority to impose consistency on their efforts they were bound to diverge. 

We have a good example of this in the passage just discussed, in the words madhyamottamaśvāsena gandhodakasahitena tu . . . . The meaning of the Saiva ´ prototype as seen in the version of the Picumata, namely madhyamottamacchā gena gandhodasahitena tu | vat.ikāṁ prāśayet prāj ñaḥ, is perfectly clear to any one who has read the whole chapter of which it is part. It means ‘The wise [initiate] should swallow a pellet made from beef, human flesh, or goat mixed with scented water’.492 The case is very different with the Buddhist versionṣTheir madhyamottamaśvāsena surely began life as a copyist’s corruption; for it yields no sense in either Saiva or Buddhist terms in the context of this rite of ´ the pellet or, indeed, in any other̥ Kumaracandra, therefore, in his commen- ¯ tary on the passage as it appears in the Herukābhyudaya, could only guess at the meaning on the basis of the one part of the sentence that made undoubted sense, namely the injunction to swallow a pellet. Knowing that such pellets were made in practice from the five meats and the five body nectars he tells us that madhyamottamaśvāsaḥ‘the intermediate and upper breath’ means those meats and that the gandhodakam ‘scented water’ with which this ‘breath’ is to be mixed 

iti | yathā saṁtoṣo jāyate tathā karaṇīyam ity arthaḥ‘The word kulikāṁis used in [this] Tantra following [its own special] conventioṇ It refers to the physical woman [who is the practitioner’s consort, when she is perceived as] identical with Va jravarāh¯ī. He should worship her, which means that he should do whatever is neces sary to satisfy her’. In his Kālacakra-influenced commentary on the Laghuśaṁ vara (Laghutantrat.īkā) Vajrapan¯ .i interprets kulikā more esoterically as referring to Va jravarāh¯ī as the non-conceptual central energy-channel: kulikāṁ p ¯ujayen nityam iti | iha kulikā madhyamāvadh ¯utī vajravārāhī nirāvaraṇā grāhyagrāhakavarjitā (p. 59). 

492 See the footnote on my emendation madhyamottamacchāgena on p. 212. [[216]]

means those nectarṣ493 

Jayabhadra and Bhavabhat.t.a commenting on the same expression when it occurs in the Laghuśaṁ vara, where the second part of the sentence has emerged through further confusion as kulikāṁ p ¯ujayet, impose quite different but equally arbitrary interpretations, which are based not on the text itself but, in the ab sence of evident meaning, on their own notions of what the text ought to be saying here. Thus Jayabhadra, who has the variant madhyamottamocchvāsena, makes madhyama- mean ‘vagina’, uttamocchvāsaḥ‘the placing of the tongue’, and gandhodakam ‘semen’, interpreting the sentence to mean that the adept should worship the Kulika, that is to say, his female consort identified with ¯ Vajravarāh¯ī, by placing his tongue (uttamocchvāsena) together with his semen (gandhodakasahitena) in her vagina (madhyama-).494 

493 Kumaracandra, ¯ Herukābhyudayapa ñjikā, p. 156: madhyamottamaśvāsaḥ pa ñca pradīpāḥ| gandhodakaṁ pa ñcāmr̥tāni ‘The word madhyamottamaśvāsaḥ means the five ‘lights’; and gandhodakaṁ means the five nectars’. On the five lights and five nectars see, e.g., Vag¯īsvarak ´īrti, Tattvaratnāvalokavivaraṇ a 18: pa ñca pradīpaśabdena gokudahanalakṣaṇ asya amr̥taśabdena vim ¯umāraśulakṣaṇ asya satatānuṣt.hānam eva sādhyaṁ manyante ‘[The learned] hold that the expres sion pa ñcapradīpa- refers to the accomplished regular practice of the [five meats] of the cow (go-), dog (ku[kkura]-), horse (da[mya]-), elephant (ha[sti]-), and man (na[ra]-), and the expression amr̥ta- to that of excrement (vi[t.]-), urine (m ¯u[tra]-), flesh (mā[ṁsa]-), blood (ra[kta]-), and semen (śu[kra]-)’. Cf.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

In Bhavabhat.t.a’s commentary we find an entirely different understanding. According to him madhyamottamaśvāsena gandhodakasahitena tu | kulikāṁ p ¯ujayet means ‘he should worship the Yoginī with the place or time (-śvāsena) of fire (madhyama-) and earth (-uttama-) together with wind (gandha-) and water (udaka-)’. The purpose of this invention, which the Sanskrit entirely fails to support, is to find a reference (1) to the symbols of the four elements as constituting the thrones of the various groups of Yoginīs in the Maṇ ḍ ala and (2) to various time periods considered to be governed by these elements as the occa sions for the successful performance of rituals for hostile purposes (abhicāraḥ), re-invigoration (pauṣt.ikam), expulsion (uccāt.anam), and the averting of danger (śāntikam) respectively. That Bhavabhat.t.a has decided what he would like to find here and then imposed it is clear from the extreme artificiality of the glosses that bend the text to his will: ‘the intermediate’ (madhyama-) is fire (vahniḥ) because it is falls in the middle of the list of the four elements (actually in the penultimate position); the ‘highest’ (-uttama-) is that of Mahendra, the presiding deity of the symbol of earth (pr̥thivī), because he is the king of the gods; gandhaḥ means not ‘fragrance’, its lexical meaning, but ‘that which possesses fragrance’, namely the wind (vāyuḥ), since that is the bearer of fragrance; udaka- is not udakam ‘water’ but an unattested udakaḥ meaning Varuṇ a, literally ‘he who possesses the waters’, since Varuṇ a is the presiding deity of the symbol of water (udakam); and śvāsaḥ means not ‘breath’ but ‘that in which X breathes’, that is to say, by an entirely unwarranted leap, the locus or time of X’s operatioṇ495 

[i.e. his semen]. The word kulikā is a term specific to the esoteric jargon of this Tantra. It denotes the physical woman [as] identical with Vajravarāh¯ī. By saying that one should ‘worship’ her the text means that one must do what is necessary to satisfy her’. 

495 Bhavabhadra, Cakrasaṁ varapa ñjikā, p. 20: madhyama uttamaḥśvasity asminn aneneti vā | śvāsaḥsthānaṁ kālo vā | madhyamo vahniḥ pr̥thivyaptejovāyava iti vacanena madhyodbhavatvāt | †madhyodbh ¯utatve ’py upāyagrahaṇ aṁ yatas tāṁ vakṣyati† | uttamo māhendro devarājatvāt | madhyamottamayoḥśvāsaḥsthānaṁ kālo vety arthaḥ| tena kulikāṁ p ¯ujayed iti saṁ bandhaḥ| kiṁ bh ¯utenetyāha gandhe tyādi | gandho ’syāstīti gandho gandhavāhatvād vāyuḥ| udakam asyāstīty udako varuṇ aḥ| tayoḥsthānena sahito gandhodakasahita iti madhyapadalopī samāsaḥ ghr̥tap ¯urṇ o ghat.o ghr̥taghat.o yathā ‘The term śvāsaḥis to be understood here to be derived from the root śvas ‘to breath’ in the meaning ‘that in which X breathes’, X in this case being madhyamaḥ and uttamaḥ. The śvāsaḥ, then, is the locus of these or their time-perioḍ The madhyamaḥ‘intermediate’ is ‘fire’, because it arises in the middle, in accordance with the text ‘earth, water, fire, and wind’; and the uttamaḥ ‘highest’ is the [symbol] of Mahendra[, the presiding deity of the earth symbol], be cause he is the king of the godṣSo the meaning of madhyamottamaśvāsaḥis ‘the locus or time of the madhyamaḥ and the uttamaḥ’. With this he should worship the Kulika. Such is the core syntax. The compound beginning ¯ gandha- describes this śvāsaḥfurther as ‘accompanied by gandha- and udaka-’, meaning ‘together with the locus of these [other] two (gandhodakasthana ¯ sahitaḥ). This is a com-

Since these confused and barely comprehensible verses are found in the opening chapter of the Laghuśaṁ vara the redactor has made a greater effort than usual to assimilate them to their new Buddhist milieu. But he has not done this by rewriting them in such a way that Buddhists would recognize and understand them as formulated within their own established discourse. His ap proach is rather that of montage or bricolage, in which bits and pieces of various texts have been clumsily combineḍ Instead of rewriting the verses he has sand wiched them between others derived from well-known Buddhist sourceṣThus the opening verses of the work (1.1–3), which immediately precede this pas sage, are a version of the opening of the Buddhist Sarvabuddhasamāyoga;496 and the verses (1.7c–13b) that follow it contain awkwardly collocated variants of verses found in that text and the Buddhist Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁ graha and Guhyasamāja.497 

But this attempt to lend the compilation a Buddhist character by embedding the passage from the Saiva Vidy ´ ap¯īt.ha between verses that Buddhist Tantrics would immediately recognize as Buddhist is mostly restricted to this first sec tioṇ The rest of the work up to the point at which the redaction known to Jaya 

pound of the type in which an intermediate word is dropped, as when one says ‘a pot of ghee’ (ghr̥taghat.aḥ) when what one means is ‘a pot full of ghee’. The other two are gandhaḥ and udakaḥ. The first is a primary derivative of gandhaḥ‘fra grance’ in the meaning ‘that which has fragrance’ and refers to the wind, because that is the bearer of fragrance. The second is [likewise] a primary derivative of udakam ‘water’ in the meaning ‘that which has water’, i.e. Varuṇ a[, the God of Wa ter]’. The application of this explanation then followṣOne is instructed to meditate on the Yoginīs one by one in a fixed order of rotation tied to the passage of time. Thus on the first Tithi of the lunar fortnight one meditates on the first eight Yo ginīs during the day-time, each for one eighth of the day, the second eight during the eight half Praharas of the night, the third eight during the day of the second Tithi, the fourth eight during the night, and so oṇ Bhavabhat.t.a explains there that the three eights that make up the 24 Yoginīs associated with the sacred sites must have the symbols of fire, water, and earth as their thrones (pp. 21–22: devīnāmāsanaṁ vahnimaṇ ḍ alam iti dinabhāgaḥ; devīnāmāsanaṁ vāruṇ amaṇ ḍ alam iti rātribhāgaḥ; devīnāṁ māhendramaṇ ḍ alamāsanam iti dinabhāgaḥ). This, evi dently, is what he means by śvāsaḥin the sense of ‘place’. He explains its sec ond meaning as ‘time’ in the following: agnyādiyogo ’py abhicārādau tathaiva j ñeyaḥ| yathābhicāre cittacakrasya vahnikṣaṇe śāntike vākcakrasya varuṇ akṣaṇe pauṣt.ike kāyacakrasya māhendrakṣaṇe uccāt.ane śmaśānacakrasya vāyukṣaṇe yo ginīnām anyatamā bhāvyā ‘This application of fire and the others should also be understood in the case of hostile rites and the like. Thus in a hostile rite one should meditate on one of the Yoginīs of the Circuit of Mind (the first eight) at a fire mo ment, on one of those of the Circuit of Speech (the second eight) at a Varuṇ a moment in a rite to avert danger, on one of those of the Circuit of the Body (the third eight) at a Mahendra moment in a rite of re-invigoration, and on one of those of the Circuit of ¯ the Cremation Grounds (the fourth eight) at a wind moment in a rite of expulsion’. 496 See here p. 154.

bhadra and Bhavyakīrti ends consists almost entirely of (1) sections for which I have found close Saiva parallels, (2) sections for which I have not found such ´ parallels but which are of the same type, and (3) sections devoted to giving the MantraṣThese, of course, have not been lifted directly from Saiva sources, be- ´ cause the Mantras so taught are peculiar to this and related TantraṣHowever, the Mantras themselves are Saiva in style; and the method of teaching them by ´ 

giving them letter by letter in encoded form (mantroddhāraḥ) has been adopted in imitation of Saiva scriptural practice, appearing first, as we have seen, in the ´ 

Sarvakalpasamuccaya that supplements the proto-Yoginītantra Sarvabuddha samāyoga.498 In the light of this one readily understands why the redactor of the version known to Bhavabhat.t.a and the other later commentators and seen in the one accessible manuscript and the Tibetan translation felt the need to add explicitly Buddhist material at the end of the work, thus accomplishing for the whole an unambiguously Buddhist frame, which in the earlier redaction had been present only in the first chapter̥499 

CONVERTING THE OUTSIDERS. The textual dependence of these Buddhist 

Yoginītantras on the scriptural corpus of the Vidyap¯īt.ha would surely have been obvious to any learned S´ akta ¯ Saiva who examined them; and there is evidence ´ that it was indeed noticeḍ We do not find this evidence in the Tantric Saiva ´ literature, since the only historical data that intrude there are the spiritual ge nealogies of its teacherṣFor the rest it is concerned purely with what it sees as the timeless realities of fact and injunction, and it is interested in relations between its own and other traditions only to the extent that it establishes a hi erarchy among these traditions by ranking their various goals along an ascent that culminates in its owṇ If awareness of this textual dependence was to find expression in Saiva literature then it could only be in the distorting mirror of ´ mythology, where the specifics of the tensions between sects could be translated 

498 See here p. 154. 

499 The special character of the added, 51st chapter is indicated in the spiritual biogra phy (rnam thar) of Tilopa ascribed to Marpa (Mar pa chos kyi blo gros). For there ¯ the Jn˜anad ¯ . akin ¯ī and her retinue are said to have taught it to Tilopa together with ¯ the oral transmission (TORRICELLI and NAGA 1995, p. 12): gsungs nas rtsa rgyud le’u nga gcig pa bshad rgyud dang bcas pa dang snyan rgyud gnang ngo. The ex tended Tantra was already current when at least some of the Vyakhy ātantras were ¯ redacteḍ The Adhidhānottara contains 50.20c–51.12b. It is possible that the text was extended first only to this point. Parts of the 50th chapter after this point are seen in the Saṁ put.odbhava: 50.21–23b and 24ab > Saṁ put.odbhava 5.1.16–19b; and 50.25 > Saṁ put.odbhava 5.1.19cḍ Verses from the remainder of the longer text, from 51.12c to the end, are found in the Yoginīsaṁcāra and the Saṁ varodaya: 51.7ab > Yoginīsaṁcāra 17.10ab; 51.13c–16b > Yoginīsaṁcāra 17.21c-24b; 51.18–19 > Saṁ varodaya 32.29c–30b; and 51.21d > Saṁ varodaya 32.31ḍ

into accounts of the interaction of the gods with demons and meṇ Thus we find our evidence in a variant of the famous narrative of Siva’s burning of the celestial ´ 

cities of the three demons (tripuradahanam) given in the Haracaritacintāmaṇi, a collection of Saiva myths for the instruction of the laity compiled in the thir- ´ teenth century by the Kashmirian S´ akta ¯ Saiva Jayadratha. ´ 500 

According to that account Br̥haspati, the ingenious Guru of the gods, puts an end to the invincibility of these demons, the reward of their devotion to Siva, ´ by fooling them into abandoning the worship of that deity. He composes and in troduces to them various texts for the visualization of Buddhist deities in which Siva and other ´ Saiva deities are portrayed as their inferiorṣThen, once they ´ have become used to these, he adds Mantras by adapting those of the Saiva ´ Tantras and composes passages giving instruction in Tantric ritual procedures by cobbling together various excerpts from the same sourceṣFinally, he com poses Buddhist treatises which supplement this Tantric corpus with reasoned arguments designed to undermine the demons’ commitment to their rites and belief in God:501 

500 Jayadratha was the brother of Jayaratha, author of the Tantrālokaviveka, on whose date see SANDERSON 2007a, pp. 418–419. That Jayadratha shared his brother’s S´ akta ¯ Saiva adherence, in keeping with the family’s long-established tradition, is ´ evident throughout his work, but particularly in the opening verses of each chap ter, in which he gives a metaphysical reading of the myth that followṣThus in 13.1, introducing this narrative of the destruction of the three cities, whose point is to glorify the Kashmirian sacred site of the volcanic fire-Linga ( ˙ jvālāliṅgam) at Suyam (Svayambhu) (on which see S ¯ TEIN 1900, vol. 2, pp. 484–485), he equates the three cities with the cognizer, cognition, and the cognized differentiated in contracted consciousness, and the fire that destroys them with the all-inclusive nonduality whose emergence bestows liberation: etad vedakavedyavedanamayaṁ dagdhvā purāṇāṁtrayaṁ p ¯urṇādvairahutāśanena śamayan māyāmayopadravam | jvālāliṅgatayā *sphura ñ (A : sphuraj Eḍ) jagadanugrāhī svayambh ¯ur asau devaḥ saṁ prati bhāsatāṁ mama parām ullāsayan nirvr̥tim ‘May that god Svayambhu¯ blaze forth for me now, revealing the highest bliss, he who has favoured the world by manifesting himself as the fire-Linga after burning these three cities that are ˙ the cognizer, the cognized, and cognition, putting an end to the torment of bound existence with the fire of all-inclusive nonduality’. This is exactly in the conceptual mode of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva nondualism of Kashmir̥ ´

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

[Br̥haspati:] “The root cause of the victory of our enemies is their devotion to Siva. ´ We must think carefully what will cause that to fade. I have already thought in general terms of a means of accomplishing that. But how[, I wonder,] will it suc ceed while [their Guru] Sukra is with them? For he exerts himself day after day ´ to strengthen their devotion to the Lord in order to *secure (conj.) their welfare. [But] although they are genuinely devoted [to Siva] they are proud of their power ´ and of low intelligence. It should therefore be easy to lead them astray”. When he had said this Indra eagerly asked him to explain the stratagem that would put an end to their worship of the Linga. Having heard this he replied and said: “Beholḍ ˙ All persons usually assign their devotion on the basis of their understanding of an ascending hierarchy. Who but Siva is at the summit [of this hierarchy], surpass- ´ ing all [others]?

[For] he, through intuition and reason, is fully conversant with ultimate reality”. Thus said the Atharvavedic priest [of the gods]. Then Indra respectfully asked him to explain the stratagem more fully. After some reflection Br̥haspati said to Indra: “It is entirely inappropriate that it should be you that has to divert [these demons] from the worship of Siva’s Li ´ nga. [So I shall take on this task myself.] ˙ My way of destroying their understanding will be thiṣI shall call this teaching Buddhist, [appropriately enough] since it will be born of [nothing more than] my intellect (buddhiḥ). The well-known Buddha will be conceived therein as the sole lord of the godṣEven the greatest deities will be portrayed as his chowry-bearerṣ

Gods that I shall call Buddhist will be depicted positioned on top of Gaṇ apati and others of the highest Saiva deitieṣWhen the demons see these falsely conceived ´ 

visualization-texts they will certainly make the mistake of thinking that these gods are greater than Siva. Once these texts have been established and I have ´ accustomed the demons to them I shall introduce Mantras modelled on [those of] the Saiva Tantras ( ´śaivatantrānuvādena) and by redacting various passages from these same scriptures (uddhr̥tya śivaśāstrebhyaḥ khaṇ ḍān khaṇ ḍān) I shall add a worthless, concocted system of [Tantric] observances involving Mantras, ritual, and the rest. The learned [Buddhist] literature that I shall compose to define bondage and liberation will be nourished by higher reasoning of an exceptional degree of rigour̥ It will explain, of course, that of these two bondage includes such activities as worshipping the Linga; and liberation will be [defined as] a voidness ˙ [of self] that [once accepted] will subvert [their commitment to their] religious dutieṣTheir sacrifices and other rituals will be opposed there; and coming to be lieve [though this teaching] that there is no soul they will denigrate Siva himself ´ [for teaching otherwise]. Indra, when I have composed learned teachings of this kind I shall insinuate them into their hearts and so put an end to their devotion to Siva. For the plan to succeed we have only to wait until ´ Sukra is absent”. ´ 

Br̥haspati’s plan workṣThe demons’ Saiva Guru leaves for a year to attend a ´ sacrifice. Br̥haspati takes on his appearance and thus disguised sets about con verting them to Tantric Buddhisṁ They become so anti-Saiva that they can no ´ longer bear even to mention the Sivali ´ nga, let alone worship it, ˙502 thus making it possible for Siva to destroy theṁ ´ 

Evidently the Buddhist Tantric scriptures that Br̥haspati is represented here as having concocted are the Yoginītantras as typified by the Laghuśaṁ vara and its satellites;503 and the fact that this understanding of the nature of the

For there the adherents of Buddhism are said to be led by three demons: Heruka, Sam ´. vara (the two Vajraḍ akas), and ¯ Adibuddha (K ālacakra). ¯ 

[[223]]Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

genesis of these texts appears in a work of this kind suggests that it was com 

mon knowledge. For the Haracaritacintāmaṇi, being concerned with the cults of Siva at sacred sites, is not addressed to the narrow community of the initiated ´ but to the widest possible audience for a Saiva text in Sanskrit, that is to say, ´ the uninitiated Saiva laity. Nor can this text be seen in spite of this as reflecting ´ the knowledge of a learned minority at the time of its compositioṇ For between the opening and closing verses of each chapter the text is written in a rather unpolished style that is so similar to that of the anonymous Puran¯ .ic tracts in praise of sacred sites that it should not be seen as a composition in the full sense of that term but rather as a compilation in which Jayadratha has lightly edited pre-existent materials of this popular genre.504 

The redactional relation between the Yoginītantras and Saiva Tantras of the ´ Vidyap¯īt.ha may not, of course, have been so obvious to learned Buddhists once these texts had been propagated and the work of commentary undertaken, let

He leads the Buddhists in their war against the godṣ¯ He is surrounded by an army of Madhyamikas ( ¯ madhyamanāmānaḥ), followers of the Mantranaya (mantranayātmakāḥ), bhramamohātmakāḥ, mithyāj ñānātmakāḥ, Sr´ avakas ( ¯ śrāvakātmānaḥ), and Buddhas copulating with their consorts (17.7–8). The meaning of the terms bhramamohātmakāḥ and mithyāj ñānātmakāḥis not immediately obviouṣSince it is clear from the context that they refer to dis tinct groups among the Buddhists (bhramamohātmakāḥ kecin mithyāj ñānātmakāḥ pare) I take them to mean ‘those who are devoted to the delusion of [the ob jective existence of] non-objective cognitions’) and ‘those who are devoted to the view that [belief in this reality of] cognitions [containing the appearance of their objects] is false’, understanding these expressions to refer to the two kinds of Yogacāras, those who hold mind-only with form and mind-only with- ¯ out form respectively to be ultimately real, that is to say Sakāravij ¯ n˜ anav ādins ānd Nirakāravij ¯ n˜anav ādinṣClassifying Mah āyāna Buddhists into M ādhyamikas ānd these two kinds of Yogacāras and the classification of all these into those ¯ who follow the Mantranaya and those who do not, that is to say, those who follow the non-Tantric Paramit ānaya, is a commonplace in the doxographical ¯ tradition of late Indian Buddhism; see, e.g., Advayavajra, Tattvaratnāvalī, pp. 4–8; Sahajavajra, Sthitisamāsa ff. 4v1–6r2 (nirākārayogācārasthitisamāsaḥ), ff. 6r2–7r1 (sākārayogācārasthitisamāsaḥ), ff. 7r1–11r3 (madhyamāsthitisamāsaḥ), and ff. 11r3–18v5 (Mantranaya); Vag¯īsvarak ´īrti, Tattvaratnāvalokavivaraṇ a, pp. 141–142 (mantranaye ca vij ñānavādamadhyamakamatayor eva pradhānatvāt . . . ); Mokṣakaragupta, ¯ Tarkabhāṣā, pp. 107–110; and KAJIYAMA 1998, pp. 148–151, 154–158. 

504 Consider Jayadratha’s own statement at the beginning of the work (1.5): deśe śrīvijayeśasya nivasan preraṇāt tayoḥ| caritrāṇi trinetrasya śāstradr̥ṣt.āni gumphaye ‘While living in the land of Siva Vijaye ´ svara I shall string together the ´ deeds of the Three-Eyed [God] as I have seen them in the sacred texts, at the insti gation of these two [teachers]’.

alone to the ordinary lay devotee of the Buddha. But the iconographical reper toire, the retinue types, the style of worship and Kapālika observance, and the ¯ growing autonomy and diversification of the goddess, are so closely parallel to what we see among the S´ akta ¯ Saivas that it is hard to believe that any Indian, ´ learned or not, could have seen these deities and observed the practices of those 

that propitiated them without being aware of this fact. 

This must have been especially so in east India. For the S´ akta tradition was ¯ particularly strong there, as it still is, and had deep roots in the domain of pop ular religion, as is evident from such Puran¯ . as of the region as the Devīpurāṇ a, Br̥hannāradīyapurāṇ a, Br̥haddharmapurāṇ a, and Kālikāpurāṇ a,505 from non eastern testimony,506 from the fact that east-Indian locations are conspicuous in early lists of the S´ akta sacred sites, ¯507 and from the inscriptions and other his

Moreover, it is probable that some at least of the surviving east-Indian im ages of the emaciated goddess reproduce the iconography of this important local forṁ An image of Carcika from the Dinajpur District of Bangladesh, in which ¯ Devīkot.a was located, shows the goddess seated beneath a banyan tree;526 and we see the same in an image from an unrecorded site in West Bengal.527 In both images severed human heads are attached by their hair to the tree’s branches, in dicating that the site of this tree is a cremation ground, since cremation grounds were also places of executioṇ528 Now, in the tradition of the Picumata and the Niśisaṁcāra each of the major S´ akta sites is a cremation ground with its ¯ own distinctive sacred tree; and in the case of Kot.ivarṣa/Devīkot.a this is in 

mayāmala, the Svayambh ¯uyāmala, the Skandayāmala, the Sārasvatayāmala, the Gāndhārayāmala, the ¯Iśānayāmala, and the Nandiyāmala: you shall have these Tantras and others in thousands, and with them men will sacrifice to you in devo tioṇ You will grant boons to men who sacrifice to you. Being goddesses of celestial power you will bestow celestial SiddhiṣAnd women who sacrifice to you regularly with the secret [rites] will become Yogesvar ´īs, women of celestial might’. On the list of Yamalatantras in this passage and its relation to lists of such texts in the ¯ Vidyap¯īt.ha see SANDERSON 2001, pp. 6–7, fn. 4. The Brahmayāmala, also called Picumata, teaches the worship of Bhairava as Hetuka surrounded with the God dess by eight Vīras and twenty-four Yoginīs in its eightieth chapter (f. 306r2–3; 80.32–33): hetukaṁ devadeveśaṁ kapālakr̥tabh ¯uṣaṇ am | vīrāṣt.akayutaṁ madhye devadevaṁ parodayaṁk kālāgnivāyusaṁ yuktam adhordhvakr̥tasaṁ gatiṁ| nyaset svar ¯upabhāsvantaṁtato yogigaṇ aṁ nyaset. It is striking that this reference to Hetuka, presumably the Bhairava of Devīkot.a, is found in a chapter which is dis tinguished by being one of the very few passages in the Vidyap¯īt.ha that departs from the Tantric norm by containing material of the Puran¯ .ic type, the subject which gives it its title being a myth of the origin of the skull-bowl and skull-staff (kapālakhat.vāṅgotpattiḥ).

deed the banyan (vat.avr̥ kṣaḥ).529 This strongly suggests that the local Carcika¯ of Devīkot.a may have been multiplied in the manner of the Nat.araja of the Tamil ¯ country, which though originally the deity of Cidambaram was established in sec ondary forms in temples throughout the regioṇ We may note also that most of the surviving east-Indian Carcikas hold the trident, often as the most conspic- ¯ uous of their held attributeṣBoth the Picumata and the Niśisaṁcāra specify this as the weapon distinctive of the Karṇ amot.ī of Devīkot.a, and the Skanda purāṇ a-Ambikākhaṇ ḍ a says that it is because the goddess of this place slew the demons with her trident here that the site contains a sacred bathing-place called S´ulakun ¯ . ḍ a ‘the pond of the trident’ and that anyone who drinks its water (ś ¯ulodakam) after doing obeisance to her will be safe from all harmful beings (171.124–125). The Picumata too refers to this Kuṇ ḍ a.530 

Finally, the pre-eminence of the emaciated goddess in the S´ aktism of eastern ¯ India during this period is strongly underlined by the fact it is she that the Bud 

dhists of the cult of Cakrasaṁ vara chose to represent supine beneath the right foot of Sam ´. vara and Vajravarāh¯ī as the female representative of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva ´ traditioṇ 

In textual references to that Buddhist icon she is generally called Kalar ātri. ¯ But there can be no doubt about her identity. For (1) she is called Carcika¯ in the Vajravārāhīsādhana of the Siddha Luy¯ī,531 and Camun ¯ . ḍ a in a Kalpa of ¯ the Abhidhānottara and in the anonymous Trayodaśātmakavajraḍākinīvajra vārāhīsādhana, which is based upon it;532 (2) Carcika is called K ālar ātri in a ¯ 

529 See here p. 112. That the sacred sites are the cremation grounds (śmaśānam) of the places listed is clear from the context in the Picumata, that (3.8–127) being a description of the nine cremation grounds that must be installed in the initiation Maṇ ḍ ala (mahāmaṇ ḍ alam), one at the centre (Prayaga) and eight āround the periphery (Varān¯ . asī, Viraja [Jajpur in Orissa], Kollagiri [Kolh āpur ¯ in Karṇ at¯ .aka], Prabhasa [in Kathiawar], Ujjayin ¯ī [in Malwa], Bhute ¯ svara [in ´ Mathura?], Ek āmraka [Bhubaneswar in Orissa], and Kot ¯ .ivarṣa). It is also clear from the account of Kot.ivarṣa given in the Skandapurāṇ a-Ambikākhaṇ ḍ a, since that prophesies that the site will become a great cremation ground (171.133c–134b): kot.īvarṣam idaṁsthānaṁ māt¯r̥ṇāṁ priyam uttamam k śmaśānaṁ pravaraṁ divyaṁ bhaviṣyati sukhapradaṁ

verse by the east-Indian poet Bhasoka; ¯533 and (3) the goddess beneath the foot of Sam ´. vara/Vajravarāh¯ī is depicted as emaciated, with sunken eyes and withered breasts, holding a skull-bowl and chopping knife in her two handṣ534 The ema ciated Carcikas of our surviving images have four, six, eight, or ten arms, but the ¯ skull-bowl (kapālam) and chopping knife (kartrikā) are indeed among their four primary attributes, the other two being the trident and a severed heaḍ535 The goddess beneath the right foot is, as it were, the east-Indian Carcika reduced to ¯ essentials: the emaciated body, the red colour, and only two arms, brandishing what were felt to be her two most basic attributeṣ

It is inconceivable, therefore, that east-Indians, for whom S´ akta ¯ Saivism was ´ so central, then as now, would not have been conscious of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva guise ´ of this new Buddhism; and it is equally inconceivable that they would have been blind to the fact that the humilated goddess supine beneath Sam ´. vara’s and Va jravarāh¯ī’s feet was the pre-eminent goddess of the east-Indian S´ akta traditioṇ ¯ 

Clearly the east-Indian Buddhists who developed this iconography chose this goddess precisely because she occupied so prominent a position in that tradition and therefore would be instantly recognizeḍ 

In explanation of why this profound transformation of Buddhism occurred, we might be tempted to say that Buddhism was simply yielding ever more com pletely to the S´ akta ¯ Saiva religious tradition then dominant in the region, failing, ´ as it were, to maintain its original purity in the face of this external pressure and the concomitant expectations of its patronṣThis was perhaps how the matter would have been represented by the Sr´ avakay ānists; and no doubt there is some ¯ truth in this assessment, since it is extremely unlikely that east-Indian Bud dhists would have chosen to develop this new manifestation of their religion if S´ akta ¯ Saivism had not become the pre-eminent religious idiom of the regioṇ But ´

the iconography of the humiliation of Carcika and Bhairava and the extensive ¯ learned literature that developed around the kernel of the Yoginītantras alert us to the fact that those who created and refined this tradition saw the matter in an entirely different light. In their view they were not succumbing passively to an alien influence. Fully conscious that they were assimilating the dominant S´ akta ¯ Saiva idiom of the region, they justified their doing so as a means of converting ´ non-Buddhists, taking their practices and encoding them with Buddhist mean ing so that outsiders could rise effortlessly through what was familiar to them to what would save them, a view exactly reflected in Jayadratha’s myth of the com pilation of anti-Saiva iconography, ´ S´ akta ¯ Saiva liturgy, Mantras, and Buddhist ´ doctrine as a means of luring devout Saivas away from their faitḥ ´ 

For while the learned literature of Tantric Buddhism claims with sincere conviction that its special methods are designed for exceptionally able aspirants within the Buddhist fold,536 its point of entry, namely initiatory introduction be fore the Maṇ ḍ ala, was designed to facilitate the recruitment of those outside it and to this end access was rendered as easy as possible. Thus in the seventh century the Mahāvairocanābhisaṁ bodhi sets out a number of qualities to be sought in candidates but states that if even only one of these is present there is no need to investigate further;537 and in the eight century the Sarvatathāgata 

536 See, for example, the doctrine of the four points of superiority of the Tantric form of the Mahayāna, the Mantranaya, over the non-Tantric Way of the Perfections ¯ (pāramitānayaḥ) asserted in the *Nayatrayapradīpa by an author whose name ap pears in the Tenjur as Tripit.akamala, an implausible name, perhaps an error for Tripit.akamalla (Tshul gsum gyi sgron ma, f. 16v3: de yang pha rol tu phyin pa’i theg pa chen po dang don gcig pa las de’i khyad par gang dag yod pa de brjod par bya’o | don gcig nyid ’ang ma rmongs dang | thabs mang dka’ ba med phyir dang | dbang po rnon po’i dbang byas pas | sngags kyi bstan bcos khyad par ’phags ‘More over, although there may be no difference in the goal [of the Mantramahayāna] ¯ from that of the Paramit āmah āyāna the points that distinguish [the former] should ¯ be stated[. This has been done done in the following verse]: “Though the goal is one and the same the Mantras´astra is superior (1) because it is free of delusion ¯ [on the path], (2) because it offers many methods [for reaching the goal], (3) be cause it is free of difficulties, and (4) because only those with the highest capacity are qualified [to undertake it]”’. The Sanskrit of the verse is preserved through citation (without attribution) in the Tattvaratnāvalī of Advayavajra (p. 8) (A), the Sthitisamāsa of his disciple Sahajavajra (f. 11v2 [6.5]) (B), and the anonymous Subhāṣitasaṁ graha (part 2, p. 31) (C): ekārthatve ’py asaṁ mohād *bah ¯upāyād (AB Tib. [thabs mang] : vajropāyād C) aduṣkarāt | tīkṣṇendriyādhikārāc ca mantraśāstraṁ viśiṣyate. It has also been cited by Ka ro pa (Karop ā?), wrongly āttributing it to a *Pradīpoddyotanatantra (sgron ma gsal ba’i rgyud), in his com mentary on the Caturmudrānvaya (MATHES 2008, p. 96). According to the view of some, as reported by Gzhon nu dpal, Ka ro pa was another disciple of Advayavajra (Blue Annals, pp. 842–843, 847–849, reported by MATHES [2008, p. 89] as saying that he was a disciple of Advayavajra’s disciple Vajrapan¯ .i).

See, e.g., Ma ñjuśriyam ¯ulakalpa, p. 236:ādau tāvat parvatāgramāruhya viṁśallakṣā ṇi japet | p ¯urvasevā kr̥tā bhavati | kṣīrāhāreṇ a mauninā nānyatra mantragata cittena triśaraṇ aparigr̥hītena utpāditabodhicittena ca poṣadhaśīlasaṁ varasamā dāpanābodhisattvasaṁ varaparigr̥hītena japtavyam | tataḥ karmāṇi bhavanti ‘Be fore [beginning the Kalpa] he must first climb to a mountain top and [there] re peat the Mantra two million timeṣ[Thus] the Preliminary Service [of the Mantra] will have been accomplisheḍ He must repeat the Mantra while sustaining himself with [nothing but] milk, maintaining silence, with his mind fixed on the Mantra and nothing else, after taking the three Refuges, having formally resolved to attain the Awakening, and having taken up the Poṣadha fast, the restraint of morality, and the restraint of a Bodhisattva.

hopes fulfilled in accordance with their desireṣVenerable [Tathagatas], there are ¯ (3) people who cannot grasp the nature of the understanding of the Mahayāna of āll the Tathagatas because they are attached to dancing, singing, joking, amuse- ¯ ments, and the pleasures of eating, and [so] take initiation before the Maṇ ḍ alas of other[, non-Buddhist] families of deitieṣBeing afraid of the moral regulations [of Buddhism] they do not enter the Maṇ ḍ alas of the family of all the Buddhas, which comprise the fulfilment of all aspirations, which bestow the highest happiness, de light, and joy. It is for these too, who are inclined to enter the way of Maṇ ḍ alas that lead to bad rebirths, that this entry into the Maṇ ḍ ala of Vajradhatu is ap- ¯ propriate, so that they may experience every happiness and delight, the highest Siddhi, joy, and contentment and be turned aside from the path that leads them to enter all [Maṇ ḍ alas that result in] bad rebirthṣVenerable [Tathagatas], there āre also (4) pious persons, who seek the Buddhas’ enlightenment by means of the morality (śīlam), concentrations (samādhiḥ), and wisdom (praj ñā) of all the Tathagatas but who experience hardship as they strive to attain the levels of the ¯ meditations (dhyānam), liberations (vimokṣaḥ), and the other [states on the path taught in the Paramit ānaya]. They will easily attain All-Buddha-hood without ¯ difficulty in this very life (atraiva), all the more so other Siddhis, simply by enter ing this Maṇ ḍ ala of Vajradhatu. ¯ 

Thus the text offered Maṇ ḍ ala initiation not only to Buddhists, and in par ticular to those who had found themselves unable to progress on the exacting path of the Paramit ānaya, but also to sinners and sensualists regardless of their ¯ religion, and, most important in the present context, to outsiders who had al ready taken a non-Buddhist Tantric initiation or might otherwise be expected do so. 

The Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁ graha does not tell us whether it has particu lar kinds of non-Buddhist Tantrics in minḍ We can only guess from the character of the initiation ceremony, with its emphasis on possession, and the cult to which initiation leads, with its erotic and sensual elements, that S´ akta ¯ Saivas must ´ have been intendeḍ Later sources, however, do make clear that it is indeed the non-Buddhist followers of the kinds of practice being adapted by the Buddhists that are in minḍ Thus Anandagarbha, the period of whose activity, though not ¯ yet narrowly determined, may be assigned to the ninth century,541 attempting 

541 The dating of Anandagarbha in the ninth century seems probable solely on the ¯ grounds of the range of his exegesis, which covers the Yogatantra systems of the Sarvatathāgataattvasaṁ graha (his Sarvavajrodaya, his commentaries on the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁ graha [Toḥ 2511]), the ¯ Paramādya (his commentary [Toḥ 2512]), the ¯ Māyājāla (his commentary [Toḥ 2513]), ¯ Guhyasamāja (his com mentary [Toḥ 1917]), and the ¯ Sarvabuddhasamāyogaḍākinījālaśaṁ vara (his com mentary on the Sarvakalpasamuccaya [Toḥ 1662]). In the last of these Tantric ¯ systems we also have in Sanskrit but not in Tibetan translation his Vajrajvālodayā nāma śrīherukasādhanopayikā in a codex photographed by Rahula S ā¯nkr ˙ .tyayana ¯ 

[[236]]

in his commentary on the Guhyasamājatantra to explain the extraordinary fact that the place where the Buddha is said to have been residing at the time that he revealed this Tantra is the vaginas of the goddesses, declares:542 

If it is asked why he was residing in their private parts, the answer is [that this is] in order to bring it about that those devoted to the Tantras of Viṣṇ u and the other [gods], who have not yet abandoned [their attachment to] the objects of the senses, may come through desire itself to delight in the abandoning of desire. For they seek to attain the Siddhis of such [gods] as Viṣṇ u by resorting to women, and using such [offerings] as beef and urine. Those engaged in the quest for the Siddhis taught by these [gods do indeed] copulate with women [for this purpose]. For [it is said in their texts]: “Viṣṇ u is Bhagavan [‘the possessor of ¯ bhaga-’] in that he resides in the genitals (bhaga-) of womeṇ He is called Narāyan ¯ . a [for the same reason,] because [by residing there] he gives pleasure to men”.543 

in the Ngor monastery in Tibet which comprises apart from this work forty-one items pertaining to the cult of Hevajra (ISAACSON 1999). The dating is supported by the tradition (Blue Annals, p. 373) that he was a pupil of Dīpankarabhadra, who ˙ was a pupil of Buddhajn˜ana, a contemporary of king Dharmap āla (r̥ ¯ c. 775–812) (see here p. 93).

543 The unknown author of this verse intends a nirvacanam of nārāyaṇ aḥ. A nirva canam is a kind of semantic analysis that explains why a word is appropriate to that to which it is applied (anvartha-). When this is not thought to be adequately revealed through ordinary grammatical analysis one may resort to an analysis in which the meaning sought is discovered by deriving one or more of a word’s syl lables from a verbal root that resembles it in sounḍ See the analysis of Yaska’s ¯ statement of this principle in KAHRS 1998, pp. 35–39. In this case the name is made to mean ‘he who gives pleasure to men’. The first component in this analy sis of nārāyaṇ aḥ was evidently nāra-, understood as either as ‘sons of man’ (nara-) by Aṣt.ādhyāyī 4.3.120 (tasyedam; cf. Manusmr̥ti 1.10ab in another nirvacanam of nārāyaṇ aḥ:āpo nārā iti proktāāpo vai naras ¯unavaḥ), or as ‘men’ (nara-) by ap plication of Aṣt.ādhyāyī 6.3.136 (anyeṣām api dr̥śyate) to account for non-standard lengthening of the first vowel. For these two alternatives see Kulluka on ¯ Manusmr̥ti 1.10ab and Medhatithi on the same for the seconḍ Since āya- can mean ‘good for tune’, I speculate that the author found his meaning by deriving the last syllable, -na, from √nī- ‘to lead [to]’, arriving by this artifice at ‘he who leads men to good fortune, i.e. happiness’ (nārān ayaṁsukhaṁ nayatīti nārāyaṇ aḥ), the substitu tion of ṇfor n being caused by the preceding r̥ The artificial derivation of -na from √nī- is seen in the semantic analysis of samānaḥfor the fourth of the five vi tal energies implicit in, e.g., Niśvāsanaya 4.124ab (Niśvāsatattvasaṁ hitā f. 40r3) (> Svacchandatantra 7.308d): samānaḥsamatāṁ nayet, and Sārdhatriśatikālottara

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

It comes as a surprise that Anandagarbha attributes the extreme Tantric ¯ practices that he details here to Vaiṣṇ avas, since nothing of this kind has been noted in their known literature. Because of this and because the use of female consorts, cow-flesh, urine and other products of the male and female body in the propitiation of deities for the attaining of supernatural powers or effects appears in our sources to be the hallmark of the Saiva Vidy ´ ap¯īt.ha, and of the Picumata in particular,544 it is tempting to propose that Anandagarbha has made a mistake ¯ 

and that had he been better informed or less careless he would have attributed these practices to those whom we know to have adopted theṁ But this cannot easily be accepted in the light of the fact that he backs up his attribution by citing a verse that supports it. I conclude, therefore, that his claim is rather evi dence that some Vaiṣṇ avas had assimilated the transgressive, S´ akta ¯ Saiva style ´ of observance, just as the Buddhists haḍ In any case, whatever the accuracy of this attribution, it is extremely unlikely that Anandagarbha did not also have ¯ the S´ akta ¯ Saivas in mind when he referred to “those devoted to the Tantras of ´ Viṣṇ u and other [gods]”. 

Similarly Sraddh ´ akaravarman, one of the Indian teachers of the Ti- ¯ betan translator Rin chen bzang po (958–1055), says in his *Yoganiruttara 

10.10cd: samaṁ nayati gātreṣu samāno nāma mārutaḥ.

The Mantra-adept should utter the Mantra 108 times, then withdraw the Linga, ˙ and make it into a pellet.

[[238]]

tantrārthāvatārasaṁ graha, referring to the Yogatantras as the Tantras of Method (Upayatantras) and to the Yogin ¯ītantras as the Tantras of Wisdom (Prajn˜atantras): ¯545 

A Method Tantra is one in which the Maṇ ḍ ala shows mainly male deities in order to train (vinī-) men and insiders (svay ¯uthya-), whereas a Wisdom Tantra is one in which, in order to train women and non-Buddhist outsiders (bāhyatīrthika-), the Maṇ ḍ ala shows mainly female deities, deities, that is, who are appropriate for these.546 A Method Tantra is one that exhibits deities that purify the outer and inner aggregates of personality (skandhāḥ), the elements (dhātavaḥ), and the faculties and their objects (āyatanāni), whereas a Wisdom Tantra is one that exhibits deities that purify the outer and inner channels of the vital energy (nāḍī) and the Bodhicitta [semen]. A Method Tantra is one that exhibits deities [whose appearance and conduct are] in conformity with the [norms of] the world, whereas a Wisdom Tantra is one that exhibits deities [whose appearance is] contrary to [these norms of] the worlḍ 

Since Sraddh ´ akaravarman states here that the predominance of female deities ¯ is designed to recruit non-Buddhists he can mean only the followers of S´ akta ¯ Saivism, since there is no other known group to whom this feature would have ´ been particularly appealing. As for the other features that he identifies as dis tinctive of the Yoginītantras, he does not state explicitly that they were intro duced with the same purpose in mind; but it seems to me probable that he means this to be understood, since the transgressive character of these deities, his third distinctive feature, is indeed a fundamental characteristic of the goddesses wor shipped by these outsiderṣ

The Buddhism sponsored by the Palas had come a long way: too far, in fact, ¯ for those conservative Buddhist monks at Vajrasana who adhered to the ancient ¯ 

545 rNal ’byor bla na med pa’i rgyud kyi don la ’jugs pa bsdus pa, ff. 103v7–104r3: gang du skyes pa dang rang gi sde pa ’dul ba’i phyir lha po’i rnam pa mang par ston pa’i dkyil ’khor ni thabs kyi rgyud do | gang du bud med dang phyi rol mu stegs can ’dul ba’i phyir de dag dang rjes su mthun pa’i lha mo’i rnam pa mang pa’i dkyil ’khor ston pa ni shes rab kyi rgyud do | gang du phyi nang gi phung po dang khams dang skye mched kyi rnam par dag pa’i lha ston pa ni thabs kyi rgyud do | gang du phyi nang gi rtsa dang byang chub kyi sems rnam par dag pa’i lha ston pa ni shes rab kyi rgyud do | gang du ’jig rten dang rjes su mthun pa’i lha’i rnam pa ston pa ni thabs kyi rgyud do | gang du ’jig rten dang ’gal ba’i lha’i rnam pa ston pa ni shes rab kyi rgyuḍ

For the S´ akta literature of the worship ¯ of this goddess has incorporated the Mahācīnakramatārāsādhana of the Bud dhist S´ a¯svatavajra, which appears almost in its entirety in the eleventh chapter ´ of the S´ akta ¯ Phetkāriṇītantra. 

I am unable to determine within narrow limits how long after S´ a¯svatavajra ´ this Tantra was composeḍ552 The earliest mention of the text in sources known to me is in 2.15 of the Sarvollāsatantra of Sarvanandan ātha, in a list of a canon ¯ of sixty-four Tantras cited from the Toḍ alatantra but not appearing in the pub lished text of that work. It is probable that Sarvanandan ātha, who wrote his ¯ work in Senhati in what is now Bangladesh, was born around the beginning of the fifteenth century.553 It is tempting to assume that the Phetkāriṇī was written at a time closer to S´ a¯svatavajra’s than to Sarv ´ anandan ātha’s, that is to ¯ 

namasta shining like ten million suns, holding her own [severed] head in her left ¯ hand, fearsome, with the mouth [of her severed head] open wide, with the tip of her tongue licking greedily, drinking the stream of blood that gushes from her neck, her hair loosened, adorned with various flowers, holding a chopping-knife in her right hand, adorned with a garland of heads, naked, most terrible, standing in the Pratyal¯īḍha posture, with a necklace of bones and a snake as her sacred thread, standing on Kama and Rati’. ¯

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

say, when the Buddhist Mantranaya was still at its height in eastern India, be fore the destruction of the great monasteries around 1200. But this destruction did not eliminate Tantric Buddhism and its literature from the region at a sin gle stroke. For it was still alive in the early fifteenth century, when Vanaratna (1384–1468) travelled to Tibet in 1426, 1433, and 1453, gave various Tantric ini tiations, notably in the Kālacakra according to the system of Anupamarakṣita, and assisted in the translation of Tantric texts, as is attested in the biography of this extraordinary figure given by Gzhon nu dpal (1392–1481), 554 who col laborated with him in a translation of the *Trayodaśātmakaśrīcakrasaṁ vara maṇ ḍ alavidhi (Toḥ 1489). We also have the ¯ Vanaratnastotrasaptaka, a San skrit hymn in praise of Vanaratna composed during his lifetime by a devout lay Buddhist Aditya, whom both the Sanskrit and Tibetan colophons say was ā native of Magadha;555 and we have a manuscript of the Mahayāna classic ¯ Bod hicaryāvatāra copied by a lay Buddhist in Bengali characters at Veṇ ugrama in ¯ 1436.556 

After her incorporation from the Mantranaya Tarā became with Daks ¯ .inakal¯ī and Tripurasundarī one of the three principal deities in the east-Indian S´ akta ¯ 

system of the ten Mahavidy ās, which soon became widely disseminated through- ¯ out the subcontinent. Thus in a passage cited from the scripture J ñānadvīpa in 

the Sarvollāsatantra (3.1–29) the ten Mahavidy ās are said to be [Daks ¯ .iṇ a]kal¯ī (Sy´ amā), T ārā, and Tripurasundar ¯ī (S. oḍ as´ī), with the third dividing into eight: herself and the seven others that make up the total of ten, namely Bhuvanesvar ´ī, Bhairavī, Chinnamasta, Dh ¯ umāvat ¯ī, Bagalamukh ¯ī, Mata ¯ ng˙ī, and Kamala. The ¯ centrality of these three goddesses is reflected in the corpus of east-Indian S´ akta ¯ scriptureṣThe Toḍ alatantra teaches the rites of these three alone, and the Br̥hannīlatantra follows the same model but adds Kamākhy ā, the great goddess ¯ of Assaṁ Their centrality is also evident among the Paippaladin Atharvavedins ¯ of Orissa; for when they absorbed the influence of the S´ aktism of Bengal in the ¯ latest stratum of their diverse Aṅgirasakalpa ¯ corpus it was principally the rites of Dakṣiṇ akal¯ī and Tarā that they adopteḍ ¯557

THE JAINS’ ADAPTATION OF THE S´ AIVA MANTRAS´ ASTRA ¯ 

Jainism too enjoyed royal support during this period, notably in western India under the Caulukyas and in Karṇ ataka among the Ga ¯ ngas of Tal ˙ .akad¯ ., the Ras¯ .t.rakut¯ .as, and Hoysal.as;558 and it too developed a Tantric ritual culture along Saiva lines for the propitiation ( ´ārādhanā) of Mantra-goddesses for mun 

dane benefits using Mudras, Japa, and offerings into fire ( ¯ homaḥ). Among god desses worshipped in Jaina rites for such purposes are Lakṣmī and Vag¯īsvar ´ī (Sarasvatī) belonging to the higher world, the Vidyadev ¯īs belonging to the mid dle,559 and, most important, in the lower world the Yakṣī attendants of the Tīrthankaras, associated with major Jaina pilgrimage sites, notably Ambik ˙ a¯ 

(/Kus¯ .man¯ . ḍinī), the attendant of Neminatha at Girn ār, Cakre ¯ svar ´ī, the attendant of R.ṣabha at Satru ´ njaya, Padm ˜ avat ¯ī, the attendant of Par¯ svan ´ atha at ¯ Sravan ´. a Bel.gol.a, and Jvalāmālin ¯ī, the attendant of Candraprabha.560 That these deities were developed on the basis of the Saiva tradition ´ 

is more transparently obvious here than in Buddhisṁ Thus the Bhairava padmāvatīkalpa, the Digambara Malliṣeṇ a’s Paddhati on the propitiation of Padmavat ¯ī, written in 1057 equates her with Totala, Tvarit ā, Nity ā, Tripur ā, ānd Tripurabhairavī, all well-known Mantra-goddesses of the S´ akta ¯ Saivaṣ´ 561

Unlike Saivism, Pa ´ ncar ˜ atra, and Tantric Buddhism in its mature form, ¯ Jaina Tantrism did not claim to offer Jainas a new path to liberatioṇ It remained entirely focused on mundane benefitṣNonetheless it was not the preserve of the laity. Monks produced the manuals and monks were held to perform these propitiationṣThus Yasobhadras ´ uri and other Mantra-adepts ¯ (māntrikāḥ) use the power that they have obtained by propitiating the goddess Kurukulla to unblock the throat of Dev ācārya when on the sixteenth day of a ¯ debate in the court of the Caulukya Siddharaja between him and the Digambara ¯ Kumudacandra the latter had used his supernatural power to silence him by causing him to choke;562 the Jaina Guru of king Ajayapala undertakes a ¯ two-month propitiation of Ambika on the Raivataka mountain at Girn ār in ¯ order to gain for himself the boon of equality with the renowned Svet ´ ambara ¯ Hemacandra and for his patron that of equality with Kumarap āla, the great ¯ Caulukya king of Gujarat.563 Hemacandra, Devendrasuri, and Malayagiris ¯ uri ¯ go to the same mountain at night to undertake the propitiation of the Siddha cakramantra, after first performing preliminary rites to summon the presiding goddess Ambika into their presence; ¯564 and Hemacandra propitiates the spell goddess Tribhuvanasvamin ¯ī in Aṇ ahillapattana, the Caulukya capital, in order to ask her about the previous birth of his pupil Kumarap āla. ¯565 

As in the non-Jaina tradition the goddesses were put to work to serve the interests of rulers. The Prabandhacintāmaṇi of Merutung˙ acārya, written at ¯ Vardhamana (Vad ¯ .hvan) in eastern K āt¯ .hiavād¯ .in 1304, claims that Padmavat ¯ī was propitiated by means of a fire-sacrifice by a Digambara monk in order to protect Varān¯ . asī, the capital of king Jayacandra (in the late twelfth century), from attack by a Muslim army;566 bards in Karṇ at¯ .aka at the court of Yasodhara ´ 

teriological concerns” (p. 35), and of the Bhairavapadmāvatīkalpa that it “contains an account of the well-known six magical arts (ṣat.karmāṇi), not greatly dissimilar from their Hindu equivalents” (p. 33).

are said to have invoked Aparajit ā to secure the king victory in battle; ¯567 and these powers are fully confirmed by the manuals for these riteṣAccording to the unpublished Jvālāmālinīkalpa, composed by the Digambara Indranandin in Karṇ at¯ .aka in 939, the benefits that can be attained by propitiating Jvalāmālin ¯ī include the splitting open of the gates of enemy forts; and the Bhairava padmāvatīkalpa teaches a spell (vidyā) for making one’s enemies fall asleep and magical receipts both for causing dissension among them (vidveṣaṇ am) and causing their death (māraṇ am). Moreover, Padmavat ¯ī was the lineage goddess (kuladevī) of a number of Jaina ruling houses in Karṇ at¯ .aka568 and functioned in this capacity much as she would have done if they had not been converteḍ Thus she appears in a local manifestation as the Padmavat ¯ī of Sa´ sakapura (Sosav ´ uru) ¯ in a Jaina myth of the origin of the name of the Hoysal.a (/Poysal.a) dynasty related in an inscription of 1133.569 When a Jaina ascetic Yogin was trying to subjugate this goddess with a Mantra and a tiger sprang out to break its power the ascetic commanded king Sal.a, saying “Strike [it], O Sal.a” (poy sal.a).570 The king then worshipped the goddess under the name Vasantik ā. Since this story ¯ introduces an account of the conquests of the dynasty it is probable that the goddess is seen here in the manner of the martial lineage goddesses of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva type venerated by non-Jaina kings during the early medieval period as ´ the source of their sovereignty and military might. 

In one important respect, however, Jaina lineage goddesses were bound to differ from their non-Jaina counterpartṣSince Jainas are the strictest of vege tarians and are rigorously opposed to the harming of any living creature, their goddesses, like those of the Buddhists, had to renounce the animal sacrifices that were so conspicuous a part of their cult in non-Jaina lineageṣ571 Thus the Osval¯

EI 6:10, l. 6: sa hoy sal.eti prāpat taṁ kila vinihatya hoysal.ākhyāṁ 571 In the Buddhist case, however, animal sacrifice, though unusual, does occur̥ We see it in the mahābali sacrifice performed by the Buddhist Newars at Lagankhel ˙ on the occasion of the chariot festival of Bugmalokesvara (Karun ´ . amaya); see S ¯ IN CLAIR 2008.

My pupil Peter-D ´ aniel Sz ´ ant ´ o has kindly informed me (personal communi- ´ cation, 4 March, 2009) that the verses that immediately precede that Mantra in this manuscript, containing the reference to sanguinary offerings, are not part of the original Catuṣpīt.ha but have been added from the Catuṣpīt.hamaṇ ḍ alopāyikā of Caryavratip āda (19.30–33 [f. 20r]).

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Jainas of Rajasthan and Saurashtra hold that their lineage deity Saccika or Sac- ¯ ciya adopted her present non-violence only when she and they were converted ¯ to Jainism by the monk Ratnaprabhasuri, probably in the twelfth century, ¯572 in consequence of his having miraculously cured a boy of snake-bite when he had already been thought dead and prepared for crematioṇ They claim that be fore their conversion they had been Rajput warriors—a claim also found among other Jain castes—573 and she a fierce Camun ¯ . ḍ a whom they propitiated with the ¯ Tantric rites of the Vamam ārga. Her pre-Jaina past is still visible in her tem- ¯ ple at Osian near Jodhpur, the Osv āls’ original home.

We have another story of the conversion of a lineage goddess in Jaina accounts of the life of the Caulukya king Kumarap āla of Gujarat (r̥ 1143– ¯ 1174), who converted from Saivism to Jainism under the influence of the ´ illustrious Svet ´ ambara scholar monk Hemacandra. According to these accounts ¯ Kaṇt.hesvar ´ī, the lineage goddess of the Caulukyas, and the other goddesses associated with her had always been placated during the nine days of the annual

For photographs of the Camun ¯ . ḍ a and ¯ Mahiṣasuramardin ¯ī see AIISPL, Accession numbers 59386 and 59388. An account of the conversion of Saccika is found in a chronicle, the ¯ Upakeśagacchapat.t.āvalī, of the monastic community followed by the Osval laity, which ends with the in- ¯ stallation of Siddhasuri in [Vikrama] 1655. See pp. 237–238 of the translation by ¯ HOERNLE (1890), who does not provide the original, for which see AGRAWALA 1954. Ratnaprabhasuri describes Saccik ā in that account as follows (H ¯ OERNLE’s transla tion, p. 237), addressing her former devotees: ‘O ye faithful, ye should not go to the temple of Sachchika-dev ¯ī; she is merciless, and incessantly delights in hearing the sound of the breaking of bones and the killing of buffaloes, goats, and other animals; the floor of her temple is stained with blood, and it is hung about with festoons of fresh skins; the teachers of her devotion, rites, and service, are cruel men; she is altogether disgusting and horrible’. The text continues: ‘Hearing these words of the Achārya ¯, they replied,— “What you say, O Lord, is quite true; but if we do not go to worship that cruel Devī, she will slay us and our familieṣ” The Achārya ¯, however, promised to protect them; whereupon they ceased to go any longer to the temple of the Devī’. Ratnaprabhasuri then goes on to convert the goddess, a tradition also āsserted in an inscription of 1598 (CORT 1987, p. 244). Thereafter, it is said, she would accept no sanguinary offerings and not even red flowers, because they resem ble such offeringṣ

Navaratra festival by the sacrifice of thousands of goats and buffaloeṣ¯575 But this stops when Kumarap āla, now a convert to Jainism, declares a fourteen-year ¯ ban on the taking of life. Kaṇt.hesvar ´ī appears before the king and demands to know why she and the other goddesses have been denied their usual sacrificeṣWhen he explains that he cannot sacrifice to her now that he is a Jaina she is enraged and strikes him on the head with her trident, causing leprous sores to break out on his body. Hemacandra miraculously cures his affliction, tries to persuade the goddess to accept in future offerings of vegetarian food of equal value, and when this fails binds her with a Mantra. Thoroughly humbled, she begs the king to free her, promising that if she is released she will give up her ways and work instead to police his ban on the slaughter of animals throughout his realṁ With Hemacandra’s permission he releases her and she takes to her new role as the king’s informer with all the zeal of the convert.576 She reports a vassal king in Sauras¯ .t.ra for secretly butchering goats in his home: Kumarap āla ¯ sends his minister Udayana at the head of an army to punish hiṁ577 She reports a merchant for plucking a louse from his wife’s head and crushing it: his entire property is seized and the money used to fund the building of a Jaina monastery, named accordingly the Monastery of the Louse (Yukāvih āra). ¯578 

575 Three thousand seven hundred goats and thirty-seven buffaloes were to be sac rificed: a hundred goats and one buffalo on the first day, two hundred goats and two buffaloes on the second, three hundred goats and three buffaloes on the third, and so on, so that nine hundred goats and nine buffaloes were sacrificed on the ninth (Mahanavam ¯ī).

In the editions of the Kumārapāladevacarita and the Kumārapālaprabodhaprabandha the goddess’ name appears in the form Kaṇt.esvar ´ī.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Thus, while drawing heavily on the S´ akta ¯ Saiva tradition of the propitia- ´ tion of Mantra-goddesses, the Jain Mantravada, was bound to keep itself free of ¯ the sanguinary aspects of those cults and, also, one would assume, of all other transgressive elements that would conflict with the ascetic character of the Jaina path, notably the use of flesh and alcohol, and the employment of female consortṣHowever, that exclusion was not as complete as one would expect in respect of the last of these elementṣThis is apparent in the accounts of two of the pro pitiations mentioned above. We are told that when Hemacandra, Devendrasuri, ānd Malayagirisuri undertook the propitiation of the Siddhacakramantra on the ¯ Raivataka mountain they did so with a Padminī in the person of the wife of a vil lage headman as their Tantric assistant (uttarasādhakatvena).579 How the wife of the village headman assisted in the propitiation is not stateḍ But the story of Hemacandra’s propitiation of Tribhuvanasvamin ¯ī is more explicit. Again he has the assistance of a Padminī. The daughter-in-law of a farmer is brought to the city for this purpose and the goddess shows her favour after Hemacandra has 

air from Aṇ ahillapattana to Bhr̥gupura (Bhr̥gukaccha, Bharukaccha, modern Bharuch/Broach) and attempt to tame the Tantric goddess Saindhava, who had ¯ possessed the minister Ambad ¯. a. She shows her contempt for Hemacandra by stick ing out her tongue. Yasa´ scandra punishes her by pounding some grains of rice in ´ a mortar̥ The first blow causes her temple to quake, and the second and third cause her image to shudder and then be dislodgeḍ She falls at Hemacandra’s feet begging for his protectioṇ See Somatilakasuri’s ¯ Kumārapāladevacarita, vv. 76–85 and Kumārapālaprabodhaprabandha §87. Saindhava is no doubt the Sindhav ā¯ī Ma whose temple is located outside the walls of Broach to the north, not far from ¯ the temple of Nīlakaṇt.ha. She was receiving goat sacrifices on Mahanavam ¯ī up to the 1940s (DESAI 1993, p. 48). According to Somatilakasuri, she was the principal ¯ of the non-Jaina deities of the city. Sindhava¯ī Ma also has temples in Ahmedabad, ¯ near Bilimora, and Kayavarohana, Vadodara.

According to the erotologi cal literature Padminīs are one of four classes of ideal love-partner (nāyikā); see, e.g., Pa ñcasāyakama ñjarī 1.6: samp ¯urṇendumukhī kuraṅganayanā pīnastanī dakṣiṇā mr̥dvaṅgī vikacāravindasurabhiḥśyāmātha gauradyutiḥ| alpāhāraratā vilāsakuśalā haṁsasvanā sadgatir lajjālur gurudevap ¯ujanaparā syān nāyikā pad minī; and in Tantric literature Hevajratantra 2.7.2–5 and Saṁ varodayatantra 31.3–5b.

repeated the Mantra for three days on the Padminī’s vulva (tasyā yonau).580 The text tells us that Hemacandra’s mind remained undisturbed during this prac tice, no doubt wishing to stress that he was not compromising the monastic rule of celibacy. Indeed there is no evidence of which I am aware that the Jaina Mantravada, unlike ¯ Saivism and Tantric Buddhism in its later phases, created ´ two levels of discipline, one for ordinary practitioners and one for an elite that ´ transcended the rules that apply to the first. Nonetheless, we see from this story that it had gone surprisingly far in this direction, too far for some, one suspects, who would have preferred monks to avoid any practice in which they could be suspected of departing from the straight and narrow Jain path of purificatioṇ 

S´ AIVISM IN THE BRAHMANICAL SUBSTRATE 

As for the long-established brahmanical tradition, the Saivas saw it as sub- ´ sumed within their own, accepting it as the only valid source of authority in what they saw as the lesser domain of mundane religion (laukiko dharmaḥ). This per ception is much emphasised in their literature,581 and it is expressed through the 

580 Kumārapāladevaprabandha §21: atha śrīhemācāryais tribhuvanasvāminīṁ vidyāmārādhayitukāmā bhāṇ ḍāgārikaṁ kapardinaṁ prāhur yan mehatāgrāme trihuṇ asiṁ haḥ kaut.umbikaḥ| tasya putrāś catvāraḥ| laghor vadh ¯uḥ padminī | yadi sāyāti tadā *tasyā avācyapradeśe (corr̥ :tasyāvācyapradeśe Eḍ) dinatrayaṁ jāpe datte devī prasīdati | etad atiduṣkaram | kapardinoktam | cintā na vidheyā | bhāṇ ḍāgārikas tatra gataḥ kaut.umbikagr̥he | tena satkr̥taḥ| prayojanaṁ pr̥ṣt.aḥ| bhāṇ ḍāgārikenoktam laghuputravadh ¯uṁ mamārpaya | tenoktaṁ kim idamādiśasi | evam eva | vicāro ’pi na kartavyaḥ| tenoktaṁ yadi bhavatāṁ *vicāre samāyātam idam (?) tadaivam astu | sukhāsane ’dhiropya pattane samāgataḥ| śrīhemas ¯uribhiḥ paramānnāhāraparair avikr̥tacittais tasyā yonau dinatrayaṁjāpaḥ kr̥taḥ| devī tuṣt.ā ‘Then Hemacārya, desiring to propitiate the spell-deity Tribhuvanasv āmin ¯ī said to his treasurer Kapardin: “There is a farmer called Trihuṇ asiṁ ha in Mehata¯ village.

ritual of consecration when installing a Siva, and likewise on the other appropri- ´ ate bodies of non-Vedic scripture when consecrating images of the Goddess and the like, provided that his Vedic procedure needs to be supplemented, provided that the imported auxiliary does not offend the Vedic procedure in any way, and provided that he does not take the initiations (dīkṣā) which those scriptures re quire.586 In other words it had to be conceded that a hybrid of Tantric and Vedic rituals procedures was already an institutional reality; and that this was so is confirmed by a Saiva source, which protests against their existence, insisting ´ that patrons should engage only initiated Saiva officiants of full conviction, who ´ would perform Saiva rituals of consecration uncontaminated by such hybridiza- ´ tioṇ587 

586 This position is established at length in the course of the commentary on Yāj ñavalkyasmr̥ti 1.7, which lists the valid sources of knowledge of religious duty (dharmam ¯ulam), namely Sruti, Smr ´.ti, and observation of the practice of exemplary brahmins, supplemented by personal judgement and preference where the other sources of knowledge leave scope for theṁ Aparaditya consid- ¯ ers at length and rejects the proposition that the scriptures of the Pa¯supatas, ´ Saivas, P ´ a¯ncar ˜ atrikas, and others not rooted in the Veda ( ¯ vedam ¯ula-) should be added to the list (vol. 1, p. 10, l. 6 ff.). He concludes: tataś ca devap ¯ujādau narasiṁ hapurāṇādiprasiddhaivetikartavyā grāhyā nānyā | evaṁ dīkṣāyām apy avagantavyam | na hi purāṇ aprasiddhāyāṁ dīkṣāyāṁjātiśodhanam asti (vol. 1, p. 14, ll. 17–19) . . . evaṁ pratiṣt.hāyām api purāṇādyuktaivetikartavyatā grāhyā nānyā teṣām eva vyāmiśradharmapramāṇ atvena bhaviṣyatpurāṇe parij ñātatvāt (p. 15, ll. 1–2) ‘And so the procedure for such [rituals] as the worship of deities that may be adopted is that taught in such Puran¯ . as as the Narasiṁ ha-, and no other̥ The same should be understood to apply in the case of initiatioṇ For in the initiation established in the Puran¯ . as the [objectionable Saiva] rite of the elim- ´ ination of [the initiand’s] caste is lacking. . . . Equally, in the case of rituals for the installation [of the image of a deity and the like only the procedure taught in Puran¯ . as and [related texts] may be adopted, since the Bhaviṣyatpurāṇ a acknowl edges none but these as sources of valid knowedge of hybrid religious duty’. By ‘hybrid’ (vyāmiśra-) Aparaditya means procedures that incorporate auxiliary ele- ¯ ments from the TantraṣThe issue of this hybrid installation rituals is taken up in detail on pp. 16, l. 1–19, l. 12. 

587 This source is the Saiddhantika scripture ¯ Devyāmata. It devotes several verses to distinguishing types of Sthapaka and to exhorting patrons to avoid all but one, ¯ who is described as learned both in the general Saiva scriptures and in the special- ´ ized Tantras of Installation, as content with the teaching of Siva, focused wholely ´ upon it, strictly adhering to the discipline of the initiated (samayācāraḥ), with out any inclination towards the scriptures of the uninitiated (paśuśāstram), tak ing no pleasure in the mundane religion, but delighting in the religion of Siva ´ alone: (2.16cd, 17ab, 19ab, 20ab):ācāryaḥśivaśāstraj ñaḥ pratiṣt.hātantrapāragaḥk . . . 17 śivaśāstrārthasaṁtuṣt.aḥsamayācārapālakaḥ| . . . 19ab śivaśāstraikacittātmā paśuśāstraparāṅmukhaḥ| . . . 20 virakto laukike dharme śivadharmānura ñjitaḥ. Sthapakas to be avoided are those who are Vaidika in their religious commit- ¯ ment and learning. Some of these have no more than a partial knowledge of the Tantras of Installation; but they should be avoided even if they mastered both the Tantras of Installation and the general Saiva scriptures (2.7–8b and 2.13–14): ´

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Instances of incorporation of Saiva ritual in the Sm ´ arta domain can be ad- ¯ duced from most regions and periods;588 but perhaps the most striking because it was so widely disseminated and accepted by those who considered themselves to be on the Smarta side of the divide is represented by the ¯ Prapa ñcasāra attributed to Sa´ nkar ˙ acārya and the closely related ¯ Sāradātilaka ´ of Lakṣmaṇ adesika. These ´ two texts, which, I have argued, were composed in Orissa or on the basis of Oris san tradition, most probably in the twelfth century,589 present a system of ritual that differs from the properly Tantric only in its catholic character—in Smarta ¯ fashion it includes rituals of propitiation for all the main deities—, its avoidance of all the elements of ‘impure’ practice that the Smartas castigated in the ¯ Saiva ´ cults of Bhairava and the Goddess, and its expurgation of doctrines that were contrary to what could be found in acceptably brahmanical sources, notably the doctrine of the thirty-six levels of reality (tattvāni). 

THE CAUSES OF THE DOMINANCE OF SAIVISM ´ 

Saivism, then, was undoutedly the most successful among the religious sys- ´ tems that received royal patronage during the early medieval perioḍ It was the most commonly adopteḍ Of the others some were absorbed by it and the rest while flourishing independently beside it came to remodel themselves along Saiva lineṣ´ 

No doubt there were many factors that led to Saivism’s rise to dominance ´ within this complex environment, and no doubt many of these will remain in visible to us, since they could be discerned and weighed only if we had access to much more detailed evidence of the activities and motivations of individuals and institutions, both religious and political. Nonetheless, I venture a general explanatioṇ 

THE EARLY MEDIEVAL PROCESS 

On the basis of the epigraphical record of acts of patronage, and consider ing evidence of changes over time within the Saivas’ prescriptive literature, I ´

propose that the fundamental reason for the religion’s success, underlying and structuring the mass of particulars now lost to view, was that it greatly increased its appeal to royal patrons by extending and adapting its repertoire to contain a body of rituals and theory that legitimated, empowered, or promoted key ele ments of the social, political and economic process that characterizes the early medieval perioḍ 

These elements were: 

1. the spread of the monarchical model of government through the emergence of numerous new dynasties at subregional, regional, and supraregional levels; 

2. the multiplication of land-owning temples, both royal temples in nuclear areas and lesser temples in peripheral zones, often established by subor dinate local lords, thus promoting the rural economy and the progressive penetration of the authority of the centre into new territories; 

3. the proliferation of new urban centres, both commercial centres that grew from below through a process of agglomeration, and planned settlements, growths from above, founded by rulers; 

4. the expansion of the agrarian base through the creation of villages, land reclamation, and the construction of water-reservoirs, wells, and other means of irrigation, with the steady growth in population that these de velopments imply; and 

5. the cultural and religious assimilation of the growing population of com munities caught up in this expansioṇ590 

At the same time it took steps to integrate itself with the brahmanical sub 

590 For this positive characterization of the period I am indebted to the work of a num ber of historians who in recent decades have shown the invalidity of the widespread view that it was a time of decline, de-urbanization, fragmentation, and general im poverishment in the aftermath of a glorious classical age that culminated under the Gupta kings and ended with their demise. I acknowledge in particular the research, conclusions, and hypotheses of Noboru KARASHIMA (1984), R. CHAMPAKALAKSHMI (1986), Hermann KULKE (1990, 1995a, b), Brajadulal CHATTOPADHYAYA (1994), Upinder SINGH (1994), Burton STEIN (1994, 1998), James HEITZMAN (1995), and Cynthia TALBOT (2001). That judgement, which owes more, one suspects, to the concept of the European Dark Ages after the collapse of the Roman empire than to unbiased analysis of India’s epigraphical and archaeological record, has its coun terpart in the not uncommon assessment that these centuries also witnessed a pro gressive degeneration of Sanskritic literary, intellectual, and religious culture. It is refreshing to see that the work of those historians who are engaging vigorously with the epigraphical and archaeological evidence of the age has brought forth a view that is more consonant with the abundant literary evidence of intellectual and aesthetic vigour̥

strate in ways that rendered it accessible and acceptable to a far wider con stituency and therefore all the more appealing to rulers in their role as the guardians of the brahmanical social order̥ 

S´ AIVISM AND MONARCHY 

Saivism’s engagement with the first and most crucial of these elements is ´ apparent in the fact that from the seventh century onwards inscriptions and pre scriptive religious texts reveal that Saiva brahmin Gurus were holding the posi- ´ tion of royal preceptor (rājaguruḥ) in numerous new kingdoms both on the Indian subcontinent and in Southeast Asia and in this capacity empowering and legiti mating the monarch’s rule by granting him Saiva initiation ( ´śivamaṇ ḍ aladīkṣā). It might be thought that this would have been an unappealing step for any but the most reclusive and ineffectual of kings, since after initiation Saivas were ´ obliged to adhere to a complex and time-consuming program of daily and oc casional ritualṣHowever, early in the development of the Mantramarga, the ¯ Saivas, no doubt in order to extend their recruitment and hence their influence, ´ admitted a category of initiates who in consideration of the fact that they were in capable of taking on these onerous duties were exonerated from doing so.591 The king was considered to qualify for this less arduous route to liberation by reason of his royal obligationṣHe was therefore required to adhere only to the obli gations of an uninitiated devotee of Siva taught in the texts of the ´ Sivadharma ´ corpus, which in his case were principally to support the religion and its institu tions and to sponsor and appear in conspicuous ceremonies in the civic domaiṇ 

Moreover, according to prescriptive sources the king’s initiation was to be followed by a Saiva modification of the brahmanical royal consecration ceremony ´ (rājyābhiṣekaḥ), bestowed both on the king and his chief consort, and also given to the heir apparent at the time that he was consecrated to succeed to his father’s 

591 The distinction between these two categories of initiate, those who receive initi ation with post-initiatory duties (sabījā dīkṣā ‘initiation with seed’ ) and those who receive it without (nirbījā dīkṣā ‘initiation without seed’), is not present in the earliest Saiddhantika scriptures, namely the corpus of ¯ Niśvāsa texts found in the Niśvāsatattvasaṁ hitā codex, the earliest of which, the M ¯ulas ¯utra, was probably composed at some time between 450 and 550, for which dating see the conclusions of a recent workshop on this text summarized in the newsletter of the Nepal-German Manuscript Cataloguing Project (GOODALL and ISAACSON 2007). On the relatively archaic character of the Niśvāsa corpus see SANDERSON 2001, pp. 22–31 (archaic features listed in fn. 32, pp. 29–31), and SANDERSON 2006. The category of exon erated initiates appears later in the Kiraṇ a, the Pārameśvara, and the Svaccha nda, and, following the latter, in the PaddhatiṣThe textual evidence is given in SANDERSON forthcoming a.

throne (yuvarājābhiṣekaḥ).592 

This new ceremony was added to the purely Saiva consecrations recognized ´ by the core tradition, through which a Saiva Guru empowered an initiate to take ´ office as a Sadhaka ( ¯ sādhakābhiṣekaḥ), a specialist in Mantra-rituals for super natural effects (siddhiḥ), and that through which a retiring Guru (ācāryaḥ) con secrated his chosen successor (ācāryābhiṣekaḥ), passing on to him his dutieṣIn this way the monarch was incorporated as a third kind of Saiva initiate, who ´ 

differed from the Sadhaka and the Guru not in the character of the initiation ¯ itself but in the consecration ceremony that followed it: while they were to be consecrated for purely Saiva functions, the king was to be consecrated to take ´ up office as the “head of [the brahmanical social order of] the caste-classes and religious disciplines” (varṇāśramaguruḥ),593 the role already assigned to him by brahmanical prescriptioṇ594 

As the function of the Saiva consecration is modified in this case, so its form, ´ though in general Saiva, incorporates distinctive non- ´ Saiva elements appropri- ´ ate to its mundane and brahmanical aspects, such as the inclusion of the royal

Just as this brahmanical rite is subsumed within the Saiva process of initia- ´ tion and consecration, so its outcome, the king’s entitlement to rule as guardian of the brahmanical social order now entails the additional requirement or, one might say, compensation to the Saivas for this descent into the mundane, that ´ he should ensure that the authority of brahmanical prescription be subsumed within, and subordinate to, that of the Saiva scriptures, an injunction supported ´ by the promise that by enforcing this hierarchical relationship he will secure the stability of his rule and kingdom, implying that by neglecting to do so he will bring about their collapse.599

The Saivas also adapted the theory of their ritual practice to enable them to ´ claim that those rulers who underwent their ceremonies would be empowered in their efforts to maintain their supremacy and extend it through conquest.

In a passage describing his marching forth to war it speaks of the ceremony of [Saiva] Man ´. ḍ ala initiation as intensifying his brilliance, a statement that in the context must be taken to refer to his power to conquer his enemieṣ604 

Nor was it only the theory that was adjusted to suit their patronṣAccording to the Br̥hatkālottara the Saiva Guru was to close the initiation ceremony by ´ giving abhiṣekaḥto the horses, elephants, chariots, and soldiers of the army by sprinkling them with the water from the vase of the Weapon-Mantra (astra 

kalaśaḥ), one of the two main vases prepared in the course of the ceremony, “in order to remove all obstacles and to ensure victory in battle”.605 The Saivas also ´ 

created a double of their ritual of post-initiatory consecration (abhiṣekaḥ) to be performed for the king before he entered the fray.606 A much elaborated form of this ‘consecration for victory’ (jayābhiṣekaḥ), involving S´ akta ¯ Saiva rather than ´ Saiva Mantra-deities and one thousand vases, is taught in the 248 verses of the ´ 

27th chapter of the Uttarabhāga of the Liṅgapurāṇ a. 

They also offered a wealth of apotropaic, invigorative, and hostile Mantra rites that could be performed on demand for the benefit of the realm, to promote the success of royal patrons, and to frustrate their enemieṣThe evidence for such

rituals in the scriptural literature of the Saivas, especially in its ´ S´ akta ¯ Saiva ´ texts, is pervasive.607 There is also historical evidence of specific performanceṣFor example, an inscription of the fifth year of the reign of the Cola Rajādhir āja ¯ II (r̥ 1163–1179 or 1166–1182) from the Tiruval¯īsvara temple at ´ Arpp ākkam ¯ near Ka¯nc˜īpuram608 tells us that when an army from Sri Lanka had invaded 

the Pan¯ . ḍ ya country, plundered the treasury of the temple of Rame ¯ svaram, and ´ interrupted the cult of Siva there, the emperor, fearing that the war might spread ´ 

approached a certain Jn˜ ana ¯ sivadeva of Gaud ´ . a, who can be seen from his name to have been a Saiddhantika ¯ Saiva Guru, to free the country from this menace ´ by ritual meanṣThe Guru, we are told, then worshipped Siva for this purpose ´ for twenty-eight days continuously, and it was reported subsequently that these ‘attackers of Siva’ ( ´śivadrohī) had indeed been defeateḍ The Badaun inscription ¯ of Lakhaṇ apala praises the R ājaguru M ¯ urtigan ¯ . a for his expertise in “the great rites of subjection and attraction” (l. 13: vaśyākr̥ṣt.imahāvidhānanipuṇ aḥ); and Hrasvanatha, a Kashmirian Guru of the K āl¯īkula who also held office as the minister of peace and war under Yasaskara (r̥ 939–948), performed a ritual to ´ kill his king and other rituals to cause dissension and immobilize, presumably directed against an invading army.609 

Just as the Guru imbued the king through the ceremonies of initiation and consecration with the numinous power of Sivahood in the exercise of his ´ sovereignty, so the Saiva rites by which the Guru assumed his office ensured ´ that he, as Siva’s agent among men, was imbued with the numen of royalty. As ´ in the brahmanical consecration of a king, in which the royal astrologer was to provide him with the royal elephant, horse, throne, parasol, fly-whisk, sword, bow, and jewels,610 so at the time of a Guru’s consecration he received from his predecessor the non-martial symbols of sovereignty (rājāṅgāni, rājacihnāni), such as the turban, crown, parasol, sandals, fly-whisk, elephant, horse, and palanquiṇ611 To these we may add the throne supported by sculpted lions

Furthermore, according to the prescriptions of the Saiva scriptures the ´ residence to be built for the Guru by his royal disciple was in many respects similar in its layout to the royal palace. It included, for example, an arsenal for the storage of weapons of war̥616 That Gurus should have needed the

612 For an image of such a throne see, e.g., the eighth-century metal Tarā from Sirpur ¯ (Sr´īpura) in HUNTINGTON 1985, plate 30. The notion that the throne is the very embodiment of sovereignty and imparts its power to the enthroned is already found in the Vedic literature, in the Satapathabrāhman ´. a (12.8.3.4) (GONDA 1966: 45–46):āsandyām abhiṣi ñcati |āsandī sad vai sāṁrājyaṁsāmrājyenaivainaṁsāmrājyaṁ gamayati ‘He consecrates him by affusion on the throne.

means of warfare may surprise. But a fragmentary inscription of the late tenth century from Kadwahā in the Guna District of Madhya Pradesh relates that ¯ when hostile forces had invaded the region and the king had been slain, the Saiva ascetic Dharma ´ siva, abbot of the Aran ´ .ipadra monastery, went into battle and routed the enemy through his skill as an archer, at the cost of his own life.617 Nor is this an isolated instance. From the Jubbulpore stone inscription of Vimalasiva, R ´ ajaguru of the Kalacuri kings Jayasim ¯ . ha (r̥ c. 1163–1188) and Vijayasiṁ ha (r̥ c. 1188–1210), we learn that the activities of his predecessor Kīrtisiva, R ´ ajaguru of Narasim ¯ . ha (r̥ 1153–1163), extended beyond the spiritual to those of a military commander who expanded his monarch’s realm and added to his own through the appropriation of temples in the territories gaineḍ618

617 EI 37:20, ll. 10–16. The inscription is fragmentary, but this much of its meaning is clear: while the ascetic Dharmasiva was in the monastery at Aran ´ .ipada (elsewhere called Araṇipadra) performing austerities (tenāraṇipadaṁ nāma kr̥taṁ padam ani nditaṁ. . . dattvāraṇipade . . .tasya dharmaśiva ity abhavaj jitātmā śiṣyaḥ. . .tasyā- śrame vardhayatas tapāṁsi [ll. 10–12]) a ruler called Gobhat.a came there with a force of elephants (tatrājagāmonmadasindhurāṇāṁ balena bh ¯upaḥ kila gobhat.ā khyaḥ[l. 12]). Someone, perhaps the local ruler, was killed by this king ([nr̥]peṇ a parāgatāsuḥsahasā papāta [ll. 12–13]); and he, evidently Dharmasiva, wept with ´ compassion for a while when he heard the news (tasyāvagamya sa kathāṁ karuṇā vimuktabāṣpaḥ kṣaṇ aṁ[l. 13]), then, flying into a rage (tad anu kopavipāt.a[lākṣaḥ] [l. 13]), went into battle, a veritable Siva on earth, armed with a bow *that had come ´ [down to him] from Prabhava[ ¯ siva?] (?) ( ´ atha prabhāvāgatakārmukeṇ a bāṇ aiś ca dīptaḥsa dharāvr̥ṣāṅkaḥ[l. 14]), and, like Siva in his Tripur ´ antaka embodiment, ¯ routed the whole army of the enemy before ascending to the incomparable world [above] in a shower of flowers scattered by Indra’s celestial nymphs (ātta[sva]līlas tripurāntakasya . . . sakalam api sa jitvā śātravaṁśarvakalpaḥ| surapatiramaṇī nāṁ puṣpavr̥ṣt.yāvakīrṇ aḥ puram anupam[aṁ] . . . [l. 15]). The poet refers here to the reward conventionally attributed to a warrior who dies bravely when fighting to protect his country; see, e.g., Mahābhārata 8, supplementary passage 14, ll. 31–34; 13, supplementary passage 15, ll.1358–1361.

Kings rewarded their Gurus with the donation or construction of monas teries (mat.haḥ) and with grants of revenue from designated lands with which they themselves constructed and endowed such institutionṣThus in the first half of the ninth century the Rajaguru Purandara founded two monasteries ¯ in Gwalior, one at Mattamayura and a second at Aran ¯ .ipadra, using the funds he had received from king Avantivarman as the dakṣiṇā for performing the king’s Saiva initiation, for which purpose he had been persuaded to move to ´ 

Mattamayura, probably from M ālava. The wealth received is described in ¯ the inscription that records these events as “[the revenue of] the most valu able portion of his kingdom”.619 Similarly, when the Kalacuri Yuvarajadeva ¯

district bore the name of Upendra, the first of the Paramara kings according to the ¯ genealogy given by the poet Padmagupta in 11.76 of his Navasāhasāṅkacarita. 620 In all secondary sources, including SANDERSON 2007a (p. 274), the name of this monastery (mat.haḥ) appears as Golakī-. That spelling is well attested, but only in manuscripts and inscriptions from the Dravidian South, where the scribes, speak ing languages in which voiced and unvoiced consonants are not distinguished, are liable to substitute k for g. We also find kolakī there. I now correct to Golagī- be cause this is what I find in the earliest testimony, which comes from regions whose vernacular languages do distinguish these consonants, namely Nepalese palm-leaf manuscripts of the Kriyākāṇ ḍ akramāvalī and the Ban¯ . garh Prasasti of the time ´ of Nayapala (r̥ ¯ c. 1027–1043) (SIRCAR 1983b, v. 6: golagyās sa mahāmat.haḥ). The name appears as Golaggī in the Chandrehe inscription (caraṇ ap ¯utagolaggikaḥ). I identify Golagī with modern Gurgi (244◦ 310 N, 81◦ 270 E), about 12 miles due east of Rewa Town, in the north of the Kalacuri kingdoṁ This is the site of once vast Saiva ´ ruins (CUNNINGHAM 1885, pp. 149–154; MEYER et al. 1908-1931, vol. 21, pp. 282– 283; BANERJI 1931, pp. 41–45). A full account of my reasons for proposing this location and for rejecting as groundless the widespread view that the monastery was in the south of the kingdom at Bher̥agh āt¯ . on the Narmada river, close to the ¯ Kalacuri capital Tripurī, must be set out elsewhere.

This alternative was already considered by PANTULU, the first editor of the Malkapuram inscriptioṇ ¯ For though he proposed the interpretation later adopted by MIRASHI, he saw the difficulty it entails (1930, p. 52): “The founder of the monastery was one Sadbhava ¯ Sambhu who obtained a gift of three lacks [ ´ sic] of villages (or was it a villages [sic] fetching an income of Nishkas (coins)?) from the Kalachuri king Yuvarajadeva and ¯ gave away those villages to the Mat.ha as an endowment”. In favour of this more realistic reading is a parallel expression seen in an inscription of the sixth century from a site near Mrohaung in Arakaṇ There we learn of the gift to a Buddhist monastery of a trisāhasriko grāmaḥ(EI 37:13, l. 13: deṅguttanāmā ttrisāhasriko grāmo nisr̥ṣt.o), which can only mean ‘a village which has [a revenue yield of] 3000’. As the editor, D.C. SIRCAR points out (p. 63), this refers “apparently to the revenue income in the standard coin”.

The exalted status and king-like behaviour of these Gurus is reflected in the fact that we have inscriptions in which they have been given royal, even impe rial titleṣThis is so with Vamadeva, also called V āma ¯ sambhu, the R ´ ajaguru of ā Kalacuri of Tripurī who was probably Ga¯ngeyadeva (r̥ ˙ c. 1015–1041), on whom that king is said to have transferred his status as the monarch (nijarājalakṣmī) as payment for his service as his Guru (gurudakṣiṇā) when he set out on a cam

paign of world conquest. Beginning with the inscriptions of his son and succes sor Karṇ a (r̥ c. 1041–1071) the Kalacuri rulers of this kingdom are described as meditating on the feet of this Vamadeva, to whose name are prefixed the impe- ¯ rial epithets paramabhat.t.ārakamahārājādhirājaparameśvaraparamamāheśva raśrī-. A variant of these titles, samadhigatapa ñcamahāśabdaparamabhat.t.ā rakamahārājādhirājaparameśvara-, is found in Nol.ambavad¯ .i records attached to the names of two other Saiddhantika Gurus, namely Brahma ¯ siva in an in- ´ scription of c. 870 and Varuṇ asiva in one of 936. Similarly, but more modestly, ´ an inscription of 1331 on a step-well in the vicinity of the Acalesvara temple ´ on Mt. Abu tells us that it was constructed during the victorious reign of the great ascetic rājaśrī-Sarvesvara during the victorious reign of the ruler ´ rājaśrī Tejaḥ siṁ ha of Candravat ¯ī.649 

649 For these imperial and royal titles attached to the names of Saiva Gurus see D.C. ´ SIRCAR in EI 30:10, pp. 46–51. There he refutes the claims expressed by V.V. MI RASHI in EI 27:29. These are (1) that Vamadeva is a king V āmar ājadeva [seen by ¯ him alone] in the Saugor inscription of Sa´ nkaragan ˙ . a, which has been assigned on palaeographic grounds to the eight century, (2) that this king should be assigned to the second half of the seventh century, and (3) that the references in inscrip tions of the later Kalacuris to these king’s devotion to [the memory] of Vamadeva, ¯ should be referred to this much earlier monarch as the founder of their dynasty. SIRCAR removes Vamadeva from the Saugor inscription, reading ¯ -vāvarāja- rather than -vāmarāja- and citing other examples of vāva- or bāva- in inscriptions, and then cites these examples of imperial or royal epithets bestowed on Saiva Gurus to ´ counter MIRASHI’s argument that their being prefixed to the name of Vamadeva ¯ proves that he was a king not a Guru. I side with SIRCAR. His view has the great strength that it accords (1) with the testimony of the Malkapuram inscription ¯ of 1261/2, which, referring to Vama ¯ sambhu as the third Guru in succession after ´ Sadbhava ¯ sambhu, the first pontiff of the Mat ´ .ha at Golagī, reports that the Kalacuri kings were being praised (praśaṁsyante) [in their Prasastis] up to the present as ´ worshippers of his feet (PANTULU 1930, v. 28: atha nr̥ paśekharamālālālitapādo ’tra vāmaśambhur abh ¯ut | adyāpi kalacurīśā yaccaraṇārādhakāḥ praśaṁsyante)— in the inscriptions of the Kalacuris of Tripurī from Karṇ a onwards they are said to be -vāmadevapādānudhyāta-—, (2) with the fact that there is no reference to a king Vamadeva in any of the inscriptions of those kings, and (3) with the fact ¯ that the source which reports the Kalacuri king’s bestowing his rājalakṣmī on Vamadeva refers to the latter as an ascetic ( ¯ sāhasikas tapasvine vāmadevanāmne nijarājalakṣmīṁ gurudakṣiṇāyai dattvā sarvāṁ bh ¯umiṁjetuṁ prasthitavān). SIR CAR convincingly identifies the Kalacuri king here called Sahasika as G ā¯ngeyadeva ˙ on the grounds that the latter was both an illustrious conqueror and known as Sahas ā¯nka ‘he who has the cognomen S ˙ ahasa’. This source, cited by S ¯ IRCAR (EI 30:10, p. 50), is a paraphrase in Jonaraja’s commentary on the ¯ Pr̥thivīrājavijaya of Jayanaka of a verse of that work now lost in a lacuna. ¯ 

The inscription referring to Brahmasiva is ´ EC 10, Sr´īnivasapura taluk, ¯ no. 27 (p. 346). SIRCAR (EI 30:10, p. 49) wrongly gives the name as Bhramarasiva and the page reference as 376. The relevant part ´ of the inscription is: svasti samadhigatapa ñcamahāśabda pallavānvaya śrīpr̥thivīvallava pallavānvayakulatilakam śrīmat-nol.ambādhirājar pr̥thivīrājya 

[[272]]

Clearly the Saiva R ´ ajaguru had become a far grander figure than the king’s ¯ brahmanical chaplain, the Rajapurohita, who was tied to the service of a single ¯ king and was unambiguously his subordinate. Yet, it appears that the Saivas did ´ not rest with this but also sought to encroach on the territory of that lesser office. For the Netratantra shows the existence of a further class of Saiva officiants who ´ were to function in almost all the areas traditionally reserved for that officiant: the performance of the king’s recurrent duties to worship the various deities on the days assigned to them, to celebrate the major annual royal festivals of the Indrotsava and Mahanavam ¯ī, to protect the royal family through rites to ward off ills, to restore them to health after illness, to ward off or counter the assaults of dangerous supernaturals, to empower through lustration (nīrājanam) the king’s elephants, horses and weapons of war, and to protect the king with apotropaic rites before he eats, sleeps, and engages in his regular practice of martial skillṣ650 

We see here one of several instances in which the Saivas used their author- ´ ity to colonize downwards, producing modifications of their ritual procedures for this purpose. These adapations inevitably entailed loss of status for those that implemented them, but we should understand that this did not affect those at the summit of the clerical hierarchy, the king-like Rajagurus, but only the hum- ¯ bler clones that extended their authority into domains that those Gurus would not deign to enter̥

The Noṇ ambesvarara is probably the imposing temple at Hem ´ avat ¯ī now known as Doḍ ḍ esvara (C ´ OHEN 1989, p. 50, and p. 63, note 36). He is also men tioned in an inscription on the Maṇ ḍ apa of the Doḍ ḍ esvara temple, which gives ´ the information that he was the disciple of Rudrasiv ´ acārya. On Varun ¯ . asiva see ´ COHEN 1998, pp. 24, 35, and 41–42, who plausibly concludes that he was Aṇ ṇiga’s Rajaguru. The initiation-names Brahma ¯ siva, Varun ´ . asiva, and Rudra ´ siva reveal ´ that these Gurus were SaiddhantikaṣThe relevant portion of the inscription from ¯ Mt. Abu has been published by SIRCAR within this discussion (EI 30:10, p. 48).

S´ AIVISM AND THE ROYAL TEMPLE 

The second element of the early medieval process to which I have drawn attention is the proliferation of land-owning templeṣAll but the most ephemeral sovereigns during this period, both in the subcontinent and in Southeast Asia, gave material form to the legitimacy and solidity of their power by building grand temples in which images of their chosen God were installed, animated, named after themselves (svanāmnā), and endowed with land and officiants to support their cult. As we have seen, the great majority of these temples enshrined Siva ´ [in the form of a Linga]. ˙ 

The Saivas of the Mantram ´ arga provided specialized officiants and rituals ¯ to establish these Sivas, developing in course of time a secondary body of scrip- ´ tural authorities, the Pratiṣt.hatantras, devoted exclusively to this domain, set- ¯ ting out the rituals of installation (pratiṣt.hā) and defining the norms for the form of the Linga, the iconography of ancillary images, and the architectural design ˙ of the various temple typeṣ651 Moroever, they asserted the principle that the Saiva Sth ´ apaka, the specialist who performs these rituals, is competent not only ¯ in the Saiva domain but also on all the levels that the ´ Saivas ranked below it. ´ Thus they claimed that he is empowered to officiate in the construction and con secration of non-Saiva deities such as Vis ´.ṇ u following the Pancar ˜ atra. ¯652 This 

651 None of the early works of this class have been publisheḍ Those known to learned authors before the end of the eleventh century and surviving in manuscripts are the Mayasaṁ graha, not to be confused with the published Maya mata, a later south-Indian work, the Piṅgalāmata, the Mohac ¯uḍ ottara, and the Devyāmata, which declares itself the pratiṣt.hātantram of the Niśvāsa. Four other works of this type, not known to have survived, are cited by the Kashmirian Vidyakan ¯ .t.ha around the beginning of the eleventh century in his commentary on the Mayasaṁ graha: the Pratiṣt.hāpārameśvara, the Nandikeśvaramata, the Paitāmaha, and the Pratiṣt.hāsamuccaya, the last of which was probably a Paddhati rather than a scripture. On all these texts see SANDERSON 2005a, pp. 440–442. 

652 See, e.g., Br̥hatkālottara, B f. 108v4: bauddhavaiṣṇ avapa ñcārthe saurakālamukhā diṣu | saivah ´.sarvadhik ār¯ ı sy ān¯ na śaive ’mī kathaṁcana ‘The Saiva [Guru] ´ has competence that extends into all [religious systems], the Buddhist, Vaiṣṇ ava, Panc˜ artha[-Pāśupata], Saura, K ´ alamukha, and others; but [Gurus of] those have ābsolutely no competence to act in the Saiva [system]’; ´ Kāmika, P ¯urvabhāga 1.121c–126, on the authority of the Sivabr ´ ahman ¯ . as, the married Saiva brahmins ´ who alone were competent to officiate for others: saivah ´.sarvadhik ār¯ ı sy āt¯ sva kīye ca paratra ca k 122 śaivāḥsarveṣu kurvanti ye gr̥hasthā dvijottamāḥ| yāmale mātr̥tantre ca kāpāle pa¯ncar ˜ atrake ¯ k 123 bauddhe cārhamate caiva lākule vai dike ’pi ca | anyeṣv api ca mārgeṣu tattacchāstraiḥsvaśāstrataḥk 124 śaivāḥ ku rvanti dīkṣādyaṁtalliṅgasthāpanādikam | mukhyatvād iha śaivasya mukhamāhā tmyato ’pi ca k 125 adhikaro ’sty sarvatra ¯ nānyeṣāṁśivadarśane | tasmāt parā rthamātmārthaṁsthāpanaṁ yajanaṁtathā k 126 śivavipreṇ a kartavyam anyeṣāṁ svārtham eva hi | parārtham api kuryāc cel *lobhena (eṁ : lopena Eḍ) nr̥ pates tathā | tadrāṣt.rasya ca nāśaḥsyād acireṇ a na saṁśayaḥ‘The Saiva is competent in ´

universalization of their authority, which is backed by learned theory of the re lation of the Saiva with the other bodies of scriptural injunction, seems not have ´ been merely theoretical. For the Saiva Paddhati literature contains instructions ´ for the consecration of Viṣṇ us, as we have seen in the case of the Paddhati of Somasambhu, ´653 and Vaiṣṇ ava sources protest at this encroachment, insisting that images of Viṣṇ u installed by Saivas should be reconsecrateḍ ´ 654

653 See Somaśambhupaddhati vol. 4, pp. 294–311 (viṣṇ usthāpanavidhiḥ). 654 In his Pa ñcarātrarakṣā (pp. 26–27) Vedantade ¯ sika, the influential ´ Sr´īvaiṣṇ ava of the fourteenth century (EI 13, p. 222), quotes a passage from the Saiva ´ Kāraṇ atantra that is more or less identical with 1.121c–124 of the passage of the Kāmika, P ¯urvabhāga cited above, and after asserting that it is inadmissi ble as evidence because all Saiva Tantras are condemned by Vedic authorities ´ quotes a passage from the south-Indian Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika ¯ Pādmasaṁ hitā (Caryāpāda 19.128b–130) to the effect that if a Viṣṇ u has been installed with the system of the Saivas it must be re-installed following the system of the Pa ´ ncar ˜ atra and pu- ¯ rified by bathing with a thousand vaseṣSee also Viṣvaksenasaṁ hitā 39.283– 285: sthāpite raudramārgeṇ a p ¯ujyamāne dine dine | hitvā raudravidhānaṁtu sarveṣāṁ hitakāmyayā k grāmavr̥ddhikaraṁ puṇ yaṁrājabh ¯usuravardhanam | tasmāt sarvaprayatnena hitvā raudraṁtu tatkṣaṇāt k sthāpayet sāttvatenātha vid hinā p ¯ujayed dharim | tasmāt sarvaprayatnena na kuryāt tantrasaṁ karam ‘If [a Viṣṇ u] has been installed following the Saiva procedure and is in daily worship [fol- ´ lowing the same] then, desiring the welfare of all, one should abandon the Saiva ´ procedure and [adopt] the holy [Vaiṣṇ ava procedure] that will cause the village, the king, and the brahmins to prosper̥ Therefore one should abandon the Saiva rites ´ immediately and scrupulously re-install the Viṣṇ u with the Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika ritual and ānd worship it [with the same thereafter].

[[275]]

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

The involvement of the Saivas of the Mantram ´ arga in the temple cult ¯ covered in early Saiva scriptural sources and all the early Paddhatis up to at ´ least the twelfth century does not extend beyond the performing of the rituals necessary to initiate the cult by consecrating the images and the temples that house theṁ The texts are silent on the nature of the worship that would be performed before those images once the Saiva Guru had completed his task. It ´ would appear, therefore, that the temple worship was in the hands of officiants of a different kinḍ However, the texts lagged behind reality in this regarḍ For at some point, well before the Saiva literature was prepared to register this fact, ´ there were Saivas of the Mantram ´ arga working as the priests that performed ¯ the regular rituals in the Saiva templeṣThe new practice is first attested in ´ the Far South in the late seventh century. We learn from a grant of the Pallava Paramesvaravarman I (r̥ ´ c. 655–960) that a certain Anantasiv ´ acārya, whose ¯ name makes it very probable that he was an initiated Saiddhantika officiant, ¯655 was appointed as the priest with hereditary rights to perform the ritual of worship (devakarma) in the temple of Siva Vidy ´ avin ¯ītapallavaparamesvara ´ established with his name by the Pallava king Paramesvaravarman I ´ alias Vidyavin ¯īta.656 

The persistent disjunction during this period between what was prescribed for Saivas and what was being done by some of them is due, I propose, to the ´ fact that functioning as a priest in a temple, and therefore living off the endow ment of the deity in return for one’s work, carried a loss of status with which the older tradition was unwilling to be associateḍ According to brahmanical sources any brahmin who persists in such work for three years is considered to 

in keeping with the mildly disparaging south-Indian Vaiṣṇ ava practice of referring to Siva as Rudra. Cf. the expression ´ rudrakālyupajīvakaḥcited here, p. 278 and the rule of the Sān ´. ḍilyasmr̥ti quoted by Vedantade ¯ sika in his ´ Pa ñcarātrarakṣā (p. 62) that Vaiṣṇ avas should keep far away from temples of Buddha, Rudra, and the like (buddharudrādivasatiṁśmaśānaṁśavam eva ca | at.aviṁrājadhānīṁca d ¯urataḥ parivarjayet). 

655 Saiddhantika ¯ Saiva initiated brahmins have initiation-names ( ´ dīkṣānāma) that end in -siva (with - ´ sambhu or, less commonly, - ´īsvara/- ´īsa or - ´ sa´ nkara as synonyms) ˙ as the second of their two components, and those of these who have been conse crated to officiate by receiving theācāryābhiṣekaḥ are referred to as N-siv ´ acārya, a ¯ practice that has continued into modern timeṣOther Anantasiv ´ acāryas are the āuthor of the Siddhāntasārāvalīvyākhyā, one of the Siv ´ acāryas, probably 95 in āll, among 108 12th-century labelled images at Darā¯suram in Tamiln ´ ad¯ .u (SRINI VASAN 1987, vol. 1:17, no. 60), and one mentioned in an inscription of 1571 at the Vat.aran ¯ . yesvara temple at Tiruv ´ ala ¯ ng˙ ad¯ .u (ARE 497 of 1906 [Appendix B: stone in scriptions copied in 1905]) as a disciple of Ponnambala Dharmasiv ´ acārya and Guru ¯ of Immaḍi Dharmasiv ´ acārya. ¯

He should worship [ ´ Siva] for his own benefit [as a private individual]. ´ He may not also worship him for the benefit of others [as a priest in the temple]. Saṁtāna: If an uninitiated brahmin has physical contact with a Siva [installed ´ in a fixed Linga in a temple] for six months he is called a Devalaka and is dis- ˙ qualified from offering worship to [any] deity [thereafter].

In the older, north-Indian literature the Prāyaścittapat.ala of the Dvādaśasāhasra Svacchanda, quoted by Hr̥dayasiva in his ´ Prāyaścittasamuccaya, f. 92v3–4, defines Devalakas when considering the matter of contamination by them, as those who as priests (bhojakāḥ) live off the Moon-god, Brahma, the Sun-god, Skanda, Vis ¯ .ṇ u, the God dess, or the Mothers: somabrahmaraviskandaviṣṇ udevyaś ca mātaraḥ| upajīvanti ye devi p ¯ujayitvā tu bhojakāḥ| te vai devalakās teṣām prāyaścittaṁ vadāmy ahaṁ The omission of Siva from this list implies that it is only the priests of other gods ´ that fall from caste. Likewise, defending the Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika priests of Vis ¯ .ṇ u’s tem ples against the same consequence, Yamuna argued, citing Vy āsa, that it is only ¯ those who earn their live off Rudra (i.e. Siva) and K ´ al¯ī by serving as their priests that become Devalakas (bhaved devalako yo vai rudrakālyupajīvakaḥ): Vaiṣṇ ava temple-priests do not become Devalakas, because they have been consecrated for their work by initiatioṇ See Yamuna, ¯ Agamaprāmān ¯. ya, pp. 15–17 (the accusation), and pp. 156–157 (the rebuttal).

Here too, of course, the royal connection is maintained and carefully nur tureḍ Thus the ceremonial repertoire of these temples included special rituals for the king’s protection (rājarakṣā);664 and temple festivals (utsavaḥ) were often timed to coincide with the day of his natal asterism or of that of a member of his family.665 Indeed the texts place a great emphasis on the connection between the temple and the welfare of the ruler and his kingdom, warning repeatedly that while the proper maintenance of the temple and its ceremonies will bene fit both, deviations or neglect will have dire consequences for theṁ This duty to maintain the status quo naturally included that of recognizing the exclusive hereditary rights of the members of this priestly community.666 

The Adi ¯ saivas are the only endogamous community of Saiddh ´ antika ¯ Saiva ´ temple-priests for which we have evidence and they seem not to have operated beyond south India. But it seems likely that there were parallel developments in other parts of the subcontinent, evidence of which has been lost or not yet come 

662 These scriptures that first appear in the works of Vedajn˜ anaguru are the ¯ Aṁśumat, the Ajita, the Kāśmīratantra, the Cintyaviśva/Cintyaviśvasādākhya, the Dīpta, the Devīkālottara, the Bhīma, the Makut.a, the Mukhabimba, the Yogaja, the Raurava, the Vijaya (/Vijayottara), the Vidveṣaṇ a, the Vīra, the Saṁtāna, the Sahasra, the Siddha, the S ¯ukṣma, and the Skandakālottara. The works of Vedajn˜anaguru in ¯ which they are cited are the Atmārthap ¯ujāpaddhati ¯, Dīkṣādarśa, and Saivāgama- ´ paribhāṣāma ñjarī. For his date see DAGENS 1979, pp. 6–7. 

663 The extant Kāmika is perhaps the first work of this kind to be cited in a date able work. Substantial passages found in it are quoted without attribution in the J ñānaratnāvalī of Jn˜ana ¯ siva, a teacher of Trilocana ´ siva and therefore a near ´ contemporary of Aghorasiva, who completed his ´ Kriyākramadyotikā in 1157. The next earliest known work in which there are citations from such scriptures is the Sivap ¯ujāstavavyākhyā ´ composed by a nameless author in the thirteenth century, probably in its second half. This date follows from the fact that he identifies himself as the great-great-grandson of the same Trilocanasiva. He cites the ´ Kāraṇ a, the Acintya, the Suprabheda, the south-Indian Pauṣkara, and the Vātulaśuddhākhya. I derive this information concerning the citations in the Sivap ¯ujāstavavyākhyā ´ and Jn˜ ana ¯ siva’s unattributed citations of the ´ Kāmika from a lecture given by Dr̥ Do minic Goodall in the Early Tantra Workshop held in Kathmandu in September 2008. For the relationships between Aghorasiva, J ´ n˜ana ¯ siva, and Trilocana ´ siva see ´ GOODALL 2000 and for confirmation of the date of Aghorasiva’s ´ Kriyākramadyotikā see GOODALL 1998, pp. xiii–xvii, fn. 24. No Sanskrit Saiddhantika works have yet ¯ been identified which can be dated within the period of three centuries between the author of the Sivap ¯ujāstavavyākhyā ´ and Vedajn˜anaguru II. ¯ 

664 Chapters devoted to this protective temple ritual for the king are found in such south-Indian Saiva texts as the ´ S ¯ukṣmāgama (pp. 290–297: rājarakṣāvidhiḥ), and the Dīptāgama (pp. 211–215: rājarakṣāvidhipat.alaḥ).

S´ AIVISM AND NEW SETTLEMENTS 

The early Saiva Pratis ´.t.hatantras show that the authority of the ¯ Saiva ´ Sthapaka was to extend to the creation of the palaces of their kingṣAmong the ¯ early Pratiṣt.hatantras the ¯ Mayasaṁ graha, Mohac ¯uḍ ottara, and Piṅgalāmata, 

667 Against the view that the Adi ¯ saiva caste is peculiar to Tamil Nadu one might ´ cite the fact that the Adi ¯ saivas are mentioned the ´ Somaśambhupaddhati, a work composed in the eleventh century far to the north (at the end of the Pavitrā rohaṇ avidhi): pa ñcayojanasaṁsthe ’pi pavitraṁ gurusaṁ nidhau | kurvīta vidhi nānena labhate vā ñchitaṁ phalam | sarvaṁ vai tv adi ¯ saiv ´ anām¯. dīkṣitānāṁ śivoditam | paropakāraśīlena śrīmatā somaśambhunā | kriyākāṇ ḍ akramāvalyāṁ pavitrakavidhiḥ kr̥taḥ. However, the line is not in the edition based on Kash mirian manuscripts (see Karmakāṇ ḍ akramāvalī vv. 494c–496b: pa ñcayojana saṁsthe ’pi pavitraṁ gurusaṁ nidhau k kurvīta vidhinānena labhate vā ñchitaṁ phalam | adhītaśivaśāstreṇ a kr̥to ’yaṁsomaśambhunā k karmakāṇ ḍ akramāvalyāṁ pavitrakavidhiḥsphut.aḥ) nor in the Nepalese transmission (see Kriyākāṇ ḍ akramā valī f. 22v4–5: pa ñcayojanasaṁstho ’pi pavitraṁ gurusaṁ nidhau | kurvīta vidhinā nena labhate vā ñchitaṁ phalam | paropakāraśīlena śrīmatā somaśambhunā | kriyā kāṇ ḍ akramāvalyāṁ pavitrakavidhiḥ kr̥taḥ). It is found only in BRUNNER’s edition and the Devakot.t.ai edition, which her edition reproduces here. It rests, therefore, exclusively on the evidence of Grantha manuscripts from the soutḥ Evidently, then, one must suspect that the line has been interpolated in Tamil Nadu by a redactor in the Adi ¯ saiva community. Its lack of intelligible connection with what precedes and ´ follows strengthens this suspicioṇ 

I have not seen the term Adi ¯ saiva in any inscriptioṇ There the officiants of ´ the Siva temples are always termed ´śivabrāhmaṇ aḥ or śivadvijaḥ. That term first occurs to my knowledge c. A.D. 863 in an inscription of Pallava Nandivar man III, from Tiruvallam in North Arcot (MAHALINGAM 1988:132). Concerning a grant to the temple of Paramesvara at T ´īkkalivallam it specifies that 500 k ād¯ .i of paddy are for the Sivabr ´ ahman ¯ . as who offer worship and services in the sanc tum (ār[ā]di[t]t-upāśarikkum [śiva]brāhmaṇ arkku) (ll. 25–26). Thereafter the term is commonplace. But it is clear that it is the group known as the Adi ¯ saivas that ´ is intended, because in these inscriptions when Sivabr ´ ahman ¯ . as are named their Gotras are sometimes given and these are those of the Adi ¯ saivas as attested both ´ by their prescriptive texts and among their modern descendants, namely Kausika, ´ Ka¯syapa, Bh ´ aradv āja, Gautama, ¯ Atreya, ¯ Agastya, and P ārā¯sara. See, e.g., ´ SII 3:41 (Ka¯syapa), 55 (Kau ´ sika), 58 (Kau ´ sika), 209 (Kau ´ sika, K ´ a¯syapa, Kau ´ sika); ´ SII 12:197 (Agastya); ¯ SII 17:152 (Bharadv āja), 157 (Bh āradv āja), 160 and 161 ¯ (Gautama), 162 and 163 (Bharadv āja), 165 (Gautama, Parāśara), 203 ( ´ Atreya, ¯ Bharadv āja), and 730 (Kāśyapa); ´ EC 3, Sr:44 (Gautama); EC 10, Kl:106a (Kausika), ´ 106d (Gautama), 107 (Kausika), 187 (Kau ´ sika, K ´ a¯syapa); ´ EC 10, Bp:29, 32, 35a, and 37a (all Gautama, Bharadv āja). Six of the seven, minus ¯ Agastya, are listed in ¯ the Saṁtāna as cited in the Atmārthap ¯ujāpaddhati ¯ A, p. 125. Five of them, lacking Atreya and Parāśara, are listed in ´ Svāyambhuva, p. 14 (Acāryalaks ¯. aṇ apat.ala 94c– 95b). This evidence accords with contemporary testimony. According to the data collected by FULLER (1984, p. 28) the Adi ¯ saiva priests of the M ´īnaks ¯ .īsundaresvara ´ temple in Madurai belong to the Ka¯syapa, Kau ´ sika, Bh ´ aradv āja, Gautama, and ¯ Atreya Gotraṣ¯

all prescribe the layout of the royal palace in detail, the latter two distinguishing between different classes, the highest being that of a paramount sovereign or Maharājādhir āja; ¯668 and in the first two works the design prescribed in cludes a section of the palace reserved for teachers of the Saiva Mantram ´ arga ¯ (mantriṇ aḥ, mantramārgopadeśinaḥ).669 But the layout of the palace taught in these Pratiṣt.hatantras is only part of the layout for an urban settlement ¯ to be established by the king around the palace, complete with markets and segregated areas for the dwellings of the various castes and artisans, with instructions for the size and plan of these dwellings determined by caste sta tuṣ670 The founding of such royal towns is not explicitly enjoined in the Saivas’ ´ ritual manualṣThat is to say that no ritual of nagarapratiṣt.hā was envisageḍ The Sthapaka was engaged, it seems, only for the choice and consecration of the ¯ site (vāstup ¯ujā) and his instructions followed for the layout of the buildings to be constructed upon it. Nonetheless, we see the Saivas involving themselves in one ´ aspect of the third of the elements of medieval process that I have listed, namely the creation of new urban settlements from above. The epigraphical record and Kalhaṇ a’s history of Kashmir demonstrate that any king of substance felt it encumbent on him to demonstrate his sovereignty not only by the building of temples but also by the creation of new urban settlements (puram), which, like the deities he established, were generally named after hiṁ671 

One of the early Pratiṣt.hatantras, the ¯ Devyāmata, devotes its 66th chapter 

668 The layout of the royal palace is prescribed in Mayasaṁ graha ff. 33v–34r (5.188–199), Mohac ¯uḍ ottara ff. 20v–22r (4.245c–281), and Piṅgalāmata ff. 74r–75v (10.126–180). 

669 Mayasaṁ graha ff. 33v–34r (5.191–193b): vitathe mantriṇ am¯. dhama ¯ sarvāstrāṇi gr̥hakṣate | antaḥ puraṁ yamapade gandharve gātr̥saṁśrayam k bhr̥ṅge senāpatisthānaṁ mr̥ ganābhyādikaṁ mr̥ ge | paitre śaucagr̥haṁ cātra tāmb ¯ulādivyapāśrayam k avarodhavadh ¯usthānaṁsugrīve tu tato nyaset; Mohac ¯uḍ ottara 4.257c–258b: vitathe mantriṇ am¯.sthanam ¯. mantramargopade ¯ sin´ am¯ k śastram antaḥ puraṁ gātr̥ kast ¯urī śaucaveśma ca | tāmb ¯ulasaṁ grahaḥstrīṇāṁ *pālakān (eṁ : pācakān Coḍ) strīniyāmakāṇ

671 This practice was followed both throughout the subcontinent and in Southeast Asia, as the following examples demonstrate: in Kashmir Pravarasena II’s Pravara pura (Sr´īnagar), Durlabhaka-Pratapāditya II’s Prat āpapura, Jay āp¯īḍ a’s Jayapura, Lalitaditya’s Lalitapura, Avantivarman’s Avantipura, ¯ Sa´ nkaravarman’s ˙ Sa´ nkara- ˙ pura, and Didda’s Didd āpura, in eastern India R āmāvat ¯ī (Ramauti) (of R āmap āla), ¯ Vijayapura of Vijayasena, and Lakṣmaṇ avat ¯ī (Lakhnauti) (of Lakṣmaṇ asena), in the south Gangaikon ˙ . ḍ acolapura, Parakesaripura, Parantakapura, R ājakesari- ¯ pura, Rajar ājapura, R ājādityapura, R ājā¯srayapura, R ´ ajendracolapura, Vikrama- ¯ colapura, Vikramapan¯ . ḍ yapura, Vikramasiṁ hapura, Vīrarajendracolapura, V ¯īra rajendrapura, and, among the Khmers ¯¯Is´anapura, Bhavapura, Ya ¯ sodharapura, ´ Rajendrapura, and Jayendranagar ¯ī.

to the layout to be followed not only in new towns but also in new villages, with an emphasis on the positioning of the various deities within the plan and the directions in which they should face. The regulations imposed show us Saiva of- ´ ficiants on a purely civic level. There is nothing specifically Saiva in the layout. ´ The Devyāmata’s chapter on iconography shows further evidence of the involve ment of the Saivas in both urban and rural planning. Differentiating various ´ forms of Siva in accordance with mood and number of arms it tells the Sth ´ apaka ¯ which are appropriate where.672 The same concern can be seen in the Pratiṣt.ha¯ sections of the South-Indian Yamalatantra texts with regard to the positioning ānd iconography of the images of Bhadrakal¯ī whose installation and cult are their concerṇ673

675 A procedure of the Pauran¯ .ika type is also taught in Aśvalāyanīyagr ¯.hyapariśiṣt.a 4.9 and Hiraṇ yakeśigr̥hyaśeṣas ¯utra 1.7.1. (EINOO 2002, pp. 713–714). 

676 We find procedures based on the prescriptions of the Matsyapurāṇ a in the rit- [[282]]

tion rituals in the early Saiva scriptures, including the Pratis ´.t.hatantraṣBut in ¯ due course Saiva officiants, seeking to add this important domain to their ritual ´ 

repertoire, produced their own versioṇ It first surfaces in our surviving evidence towards the end of the eleventh century, in the Paddhati of Somasambhu, ´677 and from that source entered both later Paddhatis such as the Siddhāntaśekhara and the Atmārthap ¯ujāpaddhati ānd the second wave of Saiva scriptural literature ´ produced in southern India.678 In spite of the Saivized character of these new ´ rituals the underlying model is still recognizably that of the brahmanical tradi tioṇ The Saiva elements are little more than a veneer on what it essentially a ´ brahmanical procedure, marked by such distinctive features as the erecting of a Naga pole ( ¯ nāgayaṣt.iḥ) at the centre of the excavation, the casting of metal images of aquatic creatures into the water, the crossing of the excavation by a cow followed by the patron of the rite, the making of offerings to Varuṇ a, and the giving of the cow to the officiant.679 Nor is there any attempt to attribute to 

ual literature of the priests of the Kashmirian brahmins; see *Vāpyādiprati ṣt.hā, ff. 893r14–905v16 (Varuṇ apratiṣt.hā); ff. 906r1–907v9 (the Varuṇ apratiṣt.hā of Jīvana); 910r1–v1 (Adityapurān ¯.e Nālakapratiṣt.hā); 929v7–931r8 (Taḍākapratiṣt.hā and Nālakapratiṣt.hā); and 931r9–931v23 (Chandogapratiṣt.hātaḥ K ¯upapratiṣt.hā). These treatments do not appear to be distinctively Kashmiriaṇ On the subject of the giving of wells and reservoirs and the Smarta/Paur ān¯ .ika procedures for conse crating them see also Caturvargacintāmaṇi, vol. 1 (Dānakhaṇ ḍ a), pp. 1001–1029. 

677 See Somaśambhupaddhati, BRUNNER 1998, pp. 392–403 and pp. 406–411. The first passage sets out the ritual for the consecration of a puṣkariṇī, but adds at its end that it applies also for the consecration of a vāpī or tat.ākaḥ. The second passage gives the ritual for the consecration of a k ¯upaḥ. A k ¯upaḥis a simple well, whereas a vāpī is a step-well, a well with a flight of steps leading down to it on one of more sides (k ¯upo ’dvārako gartaviśeṣaḥ baddhasopānako ’yaṁ vāpīti dvaitanirṇ ayaḥ: Raghunandana cited in KANE 2ii, p. 893). Such step-wells survive from the early medieval period, notably in Gujarat. The most splendid is no doubt the Ran¯ .ī kī Vav at Patan (An ¯ . ahillapattana), the old Caulukya capital. Both a puṣkariṇī and a tat.ākaḥ(/taḍāgaḥ) are water reservoirṣThe difference appears to be one of scale alone, the latter being larger than the former̥ KANE (loc. cit.) reports the view expressed by Raghunandana in his Jalāśayotsargatattva that a puṣkariṇī is from 100 to 200 cubits in length, and a taḍāgaḥis from 200 to 800, and the view of the Vasiṣt.hasaṁ hitā as quoted by Raghunandana that a puṣkariṇī is up to 400 cubits in length and a taḍāgaḥ up to 2000.

the ceremony any specifically Saiva purpose or meaning. A work of public utility ´ (p ¯urtam) after all is just that. 

That Saiva officiants were engaged to perform the consecration of irrigation ´ works undertaken by their royal patrons seems very likely.

pontifical office. The core social structure here is one of brahmin Gurus initiat

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

of the full set of possibilities, in which members of any caste-class are said to be able to initiate only their equals and inferiors, serves, I suggest, not as a record that all these possibilities were enacted but rather as an abstraction that adds authority to the more restricted common practice by presenting it as following a universally valid principle upheld in the brahmanical social system, seen, for example in the rule that a man may marry a woman born of parents of his own caste or one below it but never a woman from a community ranked above hiṁ684 Indeed Saiddhantika texts that discuss who may receive initiation and consecra- ¯ tion and who may not include the offspring of such forbidden marriages in the latter category.685 

Evidence of the existence of such self-contained S´udra Saiddh āntika lin- ¯ eages is abundant in the Tamil country at the end of our period and after it down 

to modern timeṣThere members of the Sacchudra Vel ¯ .l.al¯.a community such as Meykaṇt.ar, and ¯ N˜ anācampantar played a significant part in the development of the canon of the Tamil Saiva Siddh ´ anta, and a good number of powerful Mat ¯ .has emerged, such as those at Tarumapuram (Dharmapuram) and Tiruvad¯ .uturai, in which the presiding ascetics were and have continued to be members of this upwardly mobile Sacchudra caste. ¯686 

684 See, e.g., Yāj ñavalkyasmr̥ti, Acārādhyāya ¯ 57, 91–95.

And in the Kāmika: “The four beginning with the brahmin and the [six] Anulomas”’. The term Anuloma here is a synonym of anulomajaḥ‘born of a union that is in the natural direction’, that is to say, hypergamouṣThe six Anulomas are (1) from a brahmin man and Kṣatriya woman (Murdh āvasikta), (2) from a brahmin ¯ man and Vaisya woman (Ambas ´ .t.ha), (3) from a brahmin man and S´udra woman ¯ (Para ¯ sava); (4) from a Ks ´ .atriya man and a Vaisya woman (M ´ ahis ¯ .ya/Madgu), (5) from a Kṣatriya man and a S´udra woman (Ugra), and (6) from a Vai ¯ sya man and a ´ S´udra woman (Karan ¯ . a). See, e.g., Yāj ñavalkyasmr̥ti, Acārādhyāya ¯ 91–92. The -ādi in anulomādiṣu ṣat.su ca in the passage cited from the Cintyaviśva is redundant and may be corrupt (perhaps for anulomātmasu). 

686 ARE 1909, p. 105; STEIN 1994, pp. 235–241; GHOSE 1996, pp. 222, 253–282. STEIN hypothesizes (1994, pp. 237–239) that this rise of the Vel.l.al¯.as was the cause of the fact that from the thirteenth century onwards independent shrines of the Goddess (kāmakoṣt.ham) began to be built in the Tamil area alongside those of Siva and to ´ be enclosed with the latter in a single architectural complex. He takes this to be evidence of “the assimilation of folk conceptions of deity”. See also GHOSE 1996, pp. 221–222. There is certainly widespread evidence of S´ aktization in the later ¯ south-Indian Saiva literature. In the south-Indian Saiddh ´ antika scriptures ¯ Rau rava, Cintya, Makut.a, and S ¯ukṣma all the male deities in the circuits surrounding 

[[286]]

It might be suspected that this is an isolated development pecular to the Far South; and I must say that I am not yet aware of historical evidence of parallel developments elsewhere in India at this time or before it. However, it is ex tremely improbable that we would have found unambiguous statements in early texts that are very unlikely to have emanated from that region to the effect that S´udras may receive consecration as ¯ Acāryas, initiate others of their caste and ¯ pass on their office within it, if this was not indeed a widespread practice. This is all the more certain in the light of the fact that the same early corpus provides specific instructions on how such initiates should be named, how they should dress their hair, mark themselves with ash, and the like.687 

Siva in temple worship, from the first of the Brahmas to the last of the Weapons ´ have been provided with a personal Sakti; see ´ Raurava, Kriyāpāda, Pat.ala 59, and N.R. BHATT’s introduction to his edition of the Sārdhatriśatikālottara, pp. xviii-xix (Cintya and Makut.a) and pp. lxviii-lxix (Cintya, Makut.a, and S ¯ukṣma). There is striking evidence of a related development in the Tamil Saiva literature in the ´ Tirumantiram of Tirumular̥ That text has been assigned to the fifth, sixth, and ¯ seventh centurieṣBut it weaves together the Tamil Saiva Siddh ´ anta, the Ved ānta, ā S´ akta tradition that features ¯ kuṇ ḍ alinīyogaḥ and the cult of Tripura, and the cult ¯ of Nat.araja. This is a combination which is unlikely to predate the twelfth century ¯ (see also GOODALL 2004, pp. xxix–xxx). In Sanskrit the same amalgam appears in such works as the scripture J ñānasiddhyāgama and the Siddhāntapaddhati of a Jn˜ ana ¯ siva. ´

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

As for those below the Pure S´udras, that is to say, members of ¯ S´udra castes ¯ not considered pure and, below even them, members of the various more or less untouchable communities defined as the lowest-born (antyajāḥ), these too were drawn by the Saiddhantikas within the reach of the religioṇ Texts of this tradi- ¯ tion declare that a Guru is forbidden to give them initiation in the full sacrificial 

form (hautrī dīkṣā). But if he sees that they are inspired by sincere devotion to Siva he is required to perform for them a simplified form of initiation that avoids ´ 

direct contact. This is to be accomplished mentally (mānasī dīkṣā) or in the form of a gaze believed to transmit Siva’s liberating power ( ´ cākṣuṣī dīkṣā), or by allow ing them to drink the water with which his feet have been washed, an extension of the common devotional practice of drinking the water that gathers at the foot of an image in the course of its worship.688

Orthodox brahmanical practice denied all S´udras access through Up- ānayana to the Veda and the rituals that are animated by its Mantras and excluded even more radically the various groups it ranked below these as ‘the lowest born’ (antyajaḥ, antyajātiḥ). The texts of the Saivas justified their liber- ´ ating inroads into the mass of humanity beyond these brahmanical boundaries by boldly declaring that the system of the separation of the castes (jātibhedaḥ) is a fabrication without basis in reality, a cultural epiphenomenon rather than a deep fact of nature,689 pointing to its absence among human beings outside of India.690 Only mentality matters; and consequently all devotees of Siva ´ form a single community regardless of birth,691 one whose only true internal 

he should eliminate their bonds by such means as giving them the water from his feet. As for those who are born of inter-caste marriages in which the father’s caste is higher or *if they are connected with brahmins (?) he may do [for them the full ritual procedure] that begins with the elimination of the paths as appropriate to the [caste of the] family [in which they have been born]’. The term saṁ karajātiḥ, which I have translated literally as ‘of the mixed castes’ refers to offspring of such unions as that between a Mahis ¯ .ya (born of a Kṣatriya man and Vaisya woman) and ´ Karaṇ a woman (born of a Vaisya man and ´ S´udra woman; see, e.g., ¯ Mitākṣarā on Yāj ñavalkyasmr̥ti, Acārādhyāya ¯ 95.

However, it should not be imagined that because they insisted that the divi sions of the castes are ultimately groundless when explaining the inclusiveness of their recruitment they rejected these divisions in practice. It is one thing to extend one’s recuitment into lower social strata and quite another to reject the di visions between them in practice. Thus in spite of their rhetoric of the underlying unity of man they required that caste divisions be respected not only in relations between initiates and the wider society in matters such as marriage but also in relations between fellow-initiateṣAs we have seen, they denied impure S´udras ānd untouchables the full ceremonial form of initiation, they refused to transmit the office of Acārya to the offspring of unions between a man of a lower caste ānd a women of a higher, and they would not countenance an Acārya’s initiating ¯ his caste superior, in effect a S´udra’s initiating a brahmiṇ They also required, ¯ for example, that when initiates of different caste-classes gathered they should sit apart, each in a separate line;693 the penances (prāyaścittam) that they pre-

from the mixed castes are eating together in a single line’. 

694 See Trilocanasiva, ´ Prāyaścittasamuccaya p. 25. Similar differentiation accord ing to caste applies to the penances for eating the leavings of another’s food (ucchiṣt.abhojanam), illicit sexual intercourse, and the taking of human life; see ibiḍ, pp. 32, 35, 48, and 52–53. How the hierarchy of caste was perceived in rela tion to that between the initiated and the uninitiated can be seen in the rules for the penances needed to restore purity if one’s food has been contaminated through contact with an ucchiṣt.aḥ, a person who has eaten but has not yet purified himself. The rules for initiated brahmins will suffice to illustrate thiṣIf a brahmin initiate’s food is contaminated by another brahmin initiate the penance is 100 repetitions of the Tatpuruṣa, the Mantra that is the Lord of his Caste (jātīśaḥ). It is doubled if the contaminator is an uninitiated brahmin or an initiated Kṣatriya. One day of fasting is added to the repetitions if the contaminator is an uninitiated Kṣatriya, two if the contaminator is an initiated Vaisya, three if an initiated ´ S´udra, four if an ¯ uninitiated Vaisya, and six if an uninitiated ´ S´udra (ibiḍ, p. 31). Here we see traces ¯ of a view that the status bestowed by Saiva initiation should prevail over that of ´ caste. In its pure form this would entail that a Saiva brahmin should consider con- ´ tamination by an initiated S´udra one degree less severe than that by an uninitiated ¯ brahmin, two degrees less severe than that by an uninitiated Kṣatriya, and so oṇ But the Saiddhantikas have preferred to limit the application of this view to the ¯ lowest two castes, where it was of least consequence, allowing an initiated S´udra to ¯ be less contaminating than an uninitiated Vaisya, but not a initiated Vai ´ sya to out- ´ rank an uninitiated Kṣatriya or an initiated Kṣatriya an ordinary brahmiṇ In other words the primary distinctions here are (1) that between brahmins and Kṣatriyas on the one hand and Vaisyas and ´ S´udras on the other, and (2) that between brah- ¯ mins and KṣatriyaṣSo while a S´udra will be purer than a Vai ¯ sya if he has been ´ initiated, a Kṣatriya, in effect the king or a member of his family, will never be less pure than a Vaisya, nor a brahmin less pure than a non-brahmiṇ In this regard ´ the benefit of initiation in the case of the Kṣatriya is limited to an acceptance that he is no more contaminating than an uninitiated brahmiṇ But this is already a major concession in terms of caste and articulates the view seen elsewhere in the literature that the prosperity of society requires an alliance between the brahmins led by the Saivas and a monarch who has received initiation from the ´ Saiva Guru. ´ This view is underlined by the fact that penance is without fasting in the case of contamination by brahmins or an initiated Kṣatriya but with fasting in all other caseṣ

allowed to intrude only at the point of entry, to determine the length of the pe riod during which a Guru should examine a candidate to determine his or her fitness for initiation, or in the Mahālakṣmīmata that ends the fourth S. at.ka of the Jayadrathayāmala to enable a Guru to select the impure substance that the candidate will be given to swallow without inhibition before receiving consecra tion (abhiṣekaḥ):697 

Although there is no division of castes in this great Tantra, it is found nonetheless, O beautiful-eyed, in the commencement of initiatioṇ [For only] when people have gone through initiation do they have no caste at all. [Or rather only then] do they become members of the one ‘caste’ of Siva. For this reason, in the Vises ´.adīkṣa¯ [the Acārya] must do what I shall now explaiṇ Slender-waisted one, he should ¯ 

initiate brahmins by making them drink wine, Kṣatriyas by [making them drink] urine, Vaisyas by making them drink semen, ´ S´udras by [making them swallow] ¯ 

faeces, and women by making them embrace the body of an initiate. 

We find accordingly a stronger rejection of caste in ceremonial contexts, a conviction that pride of caste is one of the factors that hold souls in bondage, and prohibitions against ever mentioning the birth-caste of a fellow initiate. Thus in the Svacchandatantra of the Mantrapīt.ha we read:698 

O fair-faced one, all those who have been initiated by this ritual are of equal nature, whether they be brahmins, Kṣatriyas, Vaisyas, ´ S´udras, or others [of lower ¯ castes]. [For] they have been brought into a state of fusion with the nature of Siva. All are said to be [ ´ Sivas,] wearers of [his] braids, their bodies dusted [like ´ his] with asḥ All Samayins should sit in a single row. Putrakas, Sadhakas, ¯

Rituals involving the participation of people of all castes, especially those consid ered untouchable, is a marked feature here;699 and while the Saiddhantikas were ¯ 

699 See, for example, SANDERSON 2007a, pp. 282–287 for a detailed ac count of the orgiastic cakrakrīḍā/vīramelāpaḥ given in the vīratāṇ ḍ avavidhi pat.alaḥ of the Jayadrathayāmala’s fourth S. at.ka and by Vimalaprabodha in his Kālīkulakramārcana. The participation of women of the following castes/professions, in addition to those of the four Varṇ as, is prescribed in those sources: Pukkasa, liquor-seller (dhvajinī), Antyaja, potter (cakriṇī), dyer (chippiṇī), butcher (saunakī), Mata ¯ nga, tanner ( ˙ carmakārī), fisherman (dhīvarī), prosti tute (veśyā), washerman (dhāvakī), and dancer (nartakī). The Mādhavakula (Jayadrathayāmala, S. at.ka 4, f. 128r7 [A]; paraphrased in Tantrāloka 29.66 and quoted by Jayaratha thereon [B]) lists nine such woman in this context. They are the wives of a Mata ¯ nga, a D ˙ . omba, a butcher, a confectioner (kandukaḥ) (kaṁ dukī A : kārmukī B), a tanner, a liquor-seller, a cremation-ground worker (kāpālikaḥ), a fisherman, and a potter̥ The words kāpālikaḥ and kandukaḥ have not been registered in our dictionaries in the meanings attested here. The use of the former in the meaning ‘cremation-ground worker’—see also Narmamālā 2.24cd, Rājataraṅgiṇī 7.44ab and 8.995, and Lokaprakāśa, p. 6, l. 3 (kāpālakaḥin a list of serving castes)—survives in the Kashmiri derivative kāwoju/kāwuju (GRI ERSON 1915 and 1932, p. 495b41–46). For kandukaḥin the meaning ‘confec tioner’ see Prakrit kaṁ ḍ ua- and kaṁ daviya-. Such caste-promiscuous orgiastic rites are also attested by Kashmirian critics of Tantric practice. Kṣemendra at tacks them in Daśāvatāracarita 10.26 as a symptom of the degeneration of society that will herald the descent of Kalkin, Viṣṇ u’s tenth Avatara: ¯ cakrasthitau rajaka vāyakacarmakārakāpālikapramukhaśilpibhir ekapātre | pānena muktim avikalpa ratotsavena vr̥ttena cotsavavatā guravo vadanti ‘[At that time] the Gurus teach that liberation is attained in a Cakra gathering by drinking [wine] from a single vessel with dyers of cloth, weavers, tanners, cremation-ground attendants, and other such persons of the service-castes (śilpibhiḥ), and through ecstatic orgies of indiscrimi nate love-making’; and he gives a vivid description of such a S´ akta ritual in ¯ Nar mamālā 3.1–85 (84cd: nirvibhāgo ’bhavat teṣāṁraticakramahotsavaḥ). A tanner, a butcher, a potter, a fisherman, and a weaver are mentioned among the participants in 3.13–14. The Kashmirian historian Kalhaṇ a tells us that king Kalasa (r̥ 1063– ´ 1089) fell under the corrupting influence of various Tantric teachers, one of whom he describes as a merchant who had become a Guru of dyers and other workers (Rājataraṅgiṇī 7.283: rajakādīnāṁśilpināṁ gurutām agāt) and was giving initia tion to Bhairava-worshiping S´ akta brahmins ( ¯ bhat.t.apādāḥ) (7.283). Evidently the term śilpī used in this context by Kṣemendra has a wider sense than that of ‘artisan’

in general prepared to descend in the giving of full initiation only as far as mem bers of those communities classed as Sacchudra, the ¯ S´ akta ¯ Saivas had no such ´ reservations, opening such initiation even to those that brahmanism considered untouchable. As evidence that such initiations were not merely prescribed, for such prescriptions might be more rhetorical than intended to support actual com mon practice, we have the testimony of Bhat.t.a Ramakan ¯ .t.ha in his commentary on the Saiddhantika ¯ Sārdhatriśatikālottara, addressing a verse in that scripture that might but for his learned intervention be taken to mean that Saiddhantikas ¯ like himself are wrong to draw the line at the SacchudraṣIndeed his ¯ S´ akta ¯ Saiva near-contemporary and fellow Kashmirian Abhinavagupta cites this verse ´ as compelling evidence that Siva has allowed elements of the non-dualistic, caste- ´ transcending view of the S´ aktas to shine through even in this dualistic stratum ¯ of his revelation:700 

It is for this reason that even in these [dualistic scriptures] the Kaula doctrine is present for those who have perceived the [highest state of] resorption, as exem plified in such [texts] as the Kālapāda [in the statement] “He may initiate even untouchables”. 

The passage to which Abhinavagupta refers is this:701 

The [transcendent] S´ antyat ¯īta [Kal ā] is the supreme, inactive, eternal voiḍ When ¯ [a Guru] has gained knowledge of that, Skanda, he may initiate even untouch ableṣ

Bhat.t.a Ramakan ¯ .t.ha argues, as one would expect, that it is purely rhetorical in intention, but he introduces into his argument a report that the S´ aktas ¯ 

were citing it in support of their practice of actually initiating such personṣSaiddhantikas, he insists, must not follow their example. ¯702

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Examples of the initiation of untouchables, indeed of anyone other than brahmins and kings, are naturally hard to finḍ Nonetheless they are not en tirely absent. Thus the Picumata, when giving an account of its own redactional history in its opening chapter, lists fourteen disciples of a certain Padmabhairava of Orissa, stating their castes, in most cases their places of birth, and, for those who were brahmins, also their Veda and, in the case of Yajurvedins, their S´ akh ā. ¯ They include two untouchableṣ703 The account lacks the artificiality that might 

kulācāryair iva balāt kartavyam iti ‘The words śvapacān api dīkṣayet convey the superiority [of such Gurus rhetorically]. For there is no possibility of [this opta tive’s] being injunctive, because [Pan¯ .ini’s rule Aṣt.ādhyāyī 3.3.154 teaches us that] when a verb [in the optative] is qualified by api [before it] the intention is [only] to express the superior capacity [of the agent], as in [the standard example of the grammarians] api parvataṁśirasā bhindyāt “He will be able, I fancy, to break a mountain with his head”. So it is right to explain that in this case likewise [the reference to] the initiating of foreigners, untouchables, and the like *is to be un derstood (conj.) in the manner the breaking of a mountain with the head [in that example] and should not be forced to mean, as it is by the Kaula Gurus, that these persons should actually be initiated’. Bhat.t.a Ramakan ¯ .t.ha is basing his analysis of api dīkṣayet on Aṣt.ādhyāyī 3.3.154 (saṁ bhāvane ’lam iti cet siddhāprayoge). The example api parvataṁśirasā bhindyāt is given in the Kāśikāvr̥tti thereoṇ The cru cial point in this rule for Ramakan ¯ .t.ha is that an optative can be used to express the supposition that someone has the ability to do something, provided that the action envisaged does not actually take place (siddhāprayoge). His interpretation is forced, because api is more naturally taken with the noun that precedes it than with the verb that followṣ

703 The fourteen comprise eight brahmins: four Atharvavedins, of whom three are from Madhyadesa and one from Sindhu, a S ´ amavedin from Kashmir, a V ājasaneyin Ya- ¯ jurvedin from Lampa, a R ¯ . gvedin of Ka¯s´ī, and an Apastamba-Taittir ¯īya Yajurvedin from Oḍ ḍiyana.

suggest that it is a pure fabrication, and even if it were fabricated it would nonetheless reveal that this tradition wished to signal to its followers that the initiation of untouchables has a venerable precedent. Similar evidence is to be found in the literature of the S´ akta cult of the goddess Kubjik ā in its accounts of ¯ the nine and sixteen Nathas that initiates include in their worship. Among these ¯ too there are untouchableṣ704 

Nor is it the case that all Gurus of the Siddhanta would have agreed with ¯ Bhat.t.a Ramakan ¯ .t.ha that the statement in the Kālottara is merely rhetorical. This may be inferred from the passage of the Guhyasiddhi of Padmavajra cited above.705 For that tells the Buddhist adept to acquire a girl for his observance from a family of untouchables as payment for his giving them Saiddhantika ¯ Maṇ ḍ ala initiation, which reveals not only that an intimate knowledge of the rit uals of the Siddhanta could be taken for granted among these Tantric Buddhists, ¯ but also that to give Saiva initiation to such people was not out of the questioṇ ´

For if it had been, this Buddhist strategy could not have been recommendeḍ Our sources reveal, then, that the Saivas extended their recuitment be- ´ yond the high-caste circles from which most of our evidence of the religion de riveṣBut, of course, they do not readily reveal the extent to which it was adopted outside these eliteṣThe epigraphical evidence is almost entirely re- ´ stricted in this regard to records of the pious activities of rulers and brahmins, and the Saiva sources, being largely prescriptive in their concerns, tell us much ´ about what should or could be done by or for various categories of person but give us no sense of how widely these prescribed activities were adopted or sup porteḍ One of the tasks of future research, then, should be to gather data that will improve our ability to address this questioṇ At present I have lit tle to offer in this directioṇ But I can at least point to evidence that the for tunes of Saivism were not as dependent on the favour of ruling dynasties as ´ most of the data presented here might lead one to assume, enjoying at least in some regions such widespread acceptance that changes in the allegiance of a dynasty had little effect on its popularity. Research into recorded temple con struction in the period 450–1050 in South and North Karnataka, that is to say, in the Tungabhadr ˙ a-Kāver ¯ī and Tungabhadr ˙ a-Bh ¯īma zones, has counted 164 ¯ Saiva temples as against 30 Vais ´.ṇ ava in the former and 199 Saiva as against ´ 32 Vaiṣṇ ava in the latter̥ This great preponderance of Saiva foundations might ´ be attributed solely to the predilection of the region’s kings, were it not for the evidence of the next three centuries, when the region passed under the rule of the Hoysal.as (c. 1047–c. 1345), who favoured Vaiṣṇ avism over Saivisṁ For we ´ see a far smaller shift in the preponderance of Saiva temples than the theory of ´ 

dependence on royal patronage would lead us to expect. 293 Vaiṣṇ ava temples were establisheḍ But the total of new Saiva foundations remains very high, at ´ about 1,030.706 This suggests the hypothesis that rulers who invested in Saivism ´ the wealth they acquired through conquest and revenue were also reflecting the deeply rooted preference of the majority of their subjectṣ

Similarly, in Kashmir the rule of the Vaiṣṇ ava Karkot ¯ .as (c. 626–855) was marked by the founding of many royal Viṣṇ us, but it would seem that Saivism, ´ which predominates in the record of religious foundations in earler times, had merely moved out of the limelight.707 For immediately after the demise of that 

706 For all these data see SETTAR 1992, p. 43 and 54. I have added to the Saiva totals ´ those of the much less numerous S´ akta templeṣ¯ 

707 For knowledge of non-Buddhist religious foundations in Kashmir during the cen turies before the advent of the Karkot ¯ .a dynasty we depend almost entirely on the account of Kalhaṇ a’s Rājataraṅgiṇī. It is highly unreliable for this period, being wildly inaccurate in its chronology, and, in the case of the Hunnic Hephthalite kings that reigned from the time of Mihirakula to the advent of the Karkot ¯ .as, that is to

dynasty it burst forth into its golden age.708 The humbler religious landscape of small-scale religious devotion tells the same story. For among the very nu merous pilgrimage sites of the region those sacred to Siva, Bhairavas, and ´ Saiva ´ goddesses are overwhelmingly in the majority. We see this in an abundant lo cal literature of Mahātmyas, texts in Sanskrit promoting these sites; and we see ¯ it in what survives in manuscript of the Kāśmīratīrthasaṁ graha, a collection of abstracts of materials gathered without sectarian bias by the local Sanskrit scholar Sahibr ām (ḍ 1872) with the help of a staff of Pan ¯ . ḍits for an extensive 

say, c. 530–626, it is evident from numismatic data that it also disordereḍ But it is significant nonetheless that almost all the early foundations that Kalhaṇ a records other than Buddhist monasteries and brahmin settlements (Agraharas) are ¯ Saiva. ´ Asoka, evidently the emperor A ´ soka of Buddhist fame, erects a stone enclosure for ´ the national Siva Vijaye ´ svara and two A ´ soke ´ svaras within that enclosure (1.105– ´ 106). His son Jalauka establishes Jyeṣt.harudra in the capital (1.124), and builds a stone temple for Bhute ¯ svara at the Nandiks ´ .etra (1.148). His wife ¯Is´anadev ¯ī es tablishes circles of the Mothers (mātr̥cakram) at the points of access to the valley (1.122). Ravan ¯ . a worships Vat.esvara, builds a Mat ´ .ha around it, and dedicates the country to its maintenance (1.195–196). The Hephthalite Huns, with whom his chronicle reaches kings known to us from other sources, are reported to have es tablished Sivas, and, given that they were of Central Asian origin, this no doubt re- ´ flects the fact that Saivism was the dominant tradition of their new subjects, though ´ the Vaiṣṇ avism that would come to the fore under the Karkot ¯ .as begins to over lay the Saiva substrate during and after the interregnum of the non-Kashmirian ´ Matr ¯ .gupta. Mihirakula establishes a Mihiresvara in the capital (1.306). Baka es- ´ tablishes a Bakesvara (1.329), Gop ´ aditya a Jyes ¯ .t.hesvara (1.341), and Khi ´ nkhila ˙ Narendraditya shrines of Bh ¯ ute ¯ svara (1.347). Tu ´ nj ˜īna I, son of Jalaukas (proba bly this is the Jalauka, founder of Jyeṣt.harudra, whom Kalhaṇ a makes the son of Asoka), establishes a Tu ´ nge ˙ svara (2.14) and Sandhimat founds a Sandh ´īsvara, an ´ ¯Ise´ svara with the name of his ´ Saiva Guru ´ ¯Is[´ an]a, and many other Li ¯ ngas (2.131– ˙ 134). Tunj ˜īna Pravarasena I builds the temple of his Siva Pravare ´ svara together ´ with a circle of the Mothers (3.97). The short-reigned non-Kashmirian Matr ¯ .gupta establishes a Viṣṇ u Matr ¯ .guptasvamin (3.263). Pravarasena II (probably the succes- ¯ sor of Mihirakula, and identical with Pravarasena I), represented by Kalhaṇ a as a supremely devout Saiva, intends accordingly to install a Pravare ´ svara in the capital ´ that he has founded with his name (Pravarapura), but a Viṣṇ u miraculously takes its place, which the king names Jayasvamin after the architect of the temple (3.350– ¯ 351). But he installs Sadbhava ¯ sr´ī and four other [Saiva] goddesses (3.353) in the ´ capital. Laḥ khaṇ a Narendraditya, identified by S ¯ TEIN (1900, vol. 1, p. 106) with the Laḥ khaṇ a Udayaditya whose name appears on a Kashmirian silver coin, es- ¯ tablishes Viṣṇ u Narendrasvamin (3.383). His brother Tu ¯ nj ˜īna Raṇ aditya prepares ¯ to install two Raṇ esvaras in two new temples but Vis ´ .ṇ u Raṇ asvamin miraculously ¯ takes the place of one through the influence of his wife Raṇ arambh ā (3.439–455). ¯ The couple establish a Viṣṇ u Raṇ arambhasv āmin, a ¯ Siva Ran ´. arambhe ¯ svara, and a ´ Mat.ha for Pa¯supatas (3.460). The king establishes the Sun-God Ran ´ . apurasvamin ¯ (3.462), and Amr̥taprabha, another wife of his, an Amr ¯ .tesvara (3.463). His son ´ Vikramaditya establishes a Vikrame ¯ svara (3.474) and his wife Bimb ´ a a Bimbe ¯ svara ´ (3.482). On the later Hephthalites in Kashmir see DANI 1996.

descriptive survey of these sites and their traditions commissioned by Maharāja ¯ Raṇ bīr Singh (r̥ 1868–1885).709 We also see it in the information on the sacred sites of Kashmir, probably compiled around the seventh century, that is found in the Kashmirian Nīlamatapurāṇ a,710 and in the list of the major shrines of the valley given by Kalhaṇ a in the twelfth century in the preamble of his history of the country.711 

Relevant evidence of another kind is available for Andhra and the Far South, since there, where culturally hostile invaders made fewer and less damaging in roads, there remains intact a much larger body of epigraphical evidence record ing pious donations, engraved on the walls of the temples of the deities to which they were made. A survey of temple building and donation in Andhra during the thirteenth century under the Kakat ¯īyas of Warangal has shown that the great majority of endowed deities mentioned in the epigraphical corpus were Saiva. ´ 247 Siva temples constitute 67 per cent of the total and Vais ´.ṇ ava temples only 19 per cent, and the latter are mostly south of the Krishna river, increasing in frequency the further south they are, no doubt under the influence of the 

resurgence of Vaiṣṇ avism in the Tamil region after Ramānuja (ḍ 1137). From ¯ the record of those who made donations to these Saiva temples, particularly to ´ 

long-established, major temples such as those of Draks ¯ .arāma and Tripur āntaka, ¯ we can see that they were far from being restricted to the circles of royalty or the landed gentry. A high proportion of the donations are from herders, women, and traderṣ712 Likewise in the Tamil country we find in Cola times (850–1279) a number of records of donations to Siva temples made by members ´ of the Sacchudra Vel ¯ .l.al¯.a caste, the dominant cultivators of the regioṇ713

712 This evidence is derived from the work of TALBOT (2001, pp. 87–125), who provides detailed statistics and on their basis presents a cogent analysis of the patterns of temple patronage in this region and perioḍ

There is another manner in which Saivism is likely to have played a sig- ´ nificant part in the process of social integration during this period, one which I wish to touch on only briefly and tentatively at this stage. This was in the incorporation of the many local deity-cults of the regions being drawn into the orbit of the state and its patronage of religioṇ In this it seems that it was the non-Saiddhantika traditions of the worship of Bhairavas, goddesses, and Yogin ¯īs, with their indifference to caste-status and brahmanical criteria of purity and their cults of possession that are likely to have provided the avenue of assimi latioṇ714 It seems likely, though difficult to prove, that much of the character of these traditions resulted from this process of incorporation on the frontier be tween the brahmanical and the not yet brahmanizeḍ

While extending its influence far beyond the confines of the orthodox brah manical world the Saivism of the Mantram ´ arga sought to guard itself against ¯ dissociation from that worlḍ It elaborated an inclusivist model of revelation that ranked other religious systems as stages of an ascent to liberation in Saivism, ´ 715

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

the religion of the king manifest in his initiation, his consecration, and his royal temples, thus mirroring and validating the incorporative structure of the state’s power̥ But though it thereby asserted, especially in its S´ akta forms, the limited ¯ nature of the brahmanical observance that formed the lowest level and broad base of this hierarchy, it was careful to insist not only that the brahmanical scriptures that govern this observance are exclusively valid in their own domain but also that their injunctions are as binding on Saivas after their initiation as ´ they were before it if they remained in that domain as active members of society. Saiva ascetics were allowed a degree of choice in this matter, at least in theory, ´ but householders were not.716 The religion of the Saivas, then, was not ´ Saivism ´ alone but rather Saivism and Brahmanism, a fact born out not only by their lit- ´ erature but also by biographical data and the epigraphic record of the activities of Saiva kingṣ´ 

Moreover, the determination of the Saivism of the Mantram ´ arga to be fully ¯ embedded in the brahmanical tradition is manifest not only in this rule that ini tiates should maintain their brahmanical obligations but also in the fact that they extended their own ritual repertoire in order to bring it into greater congru ence with the brahmanical. To this end they created a Saiva ritual of cremation ´ and a series of rituals to mirror the numerous brahmanical postmortuary rituals in which the deceased receives offerings first as a hungry ghost (pretakriyā) and then in Sr´ addha rituals as an ancestor, after his incorporation with the immedi- āte ascendants of his patriline (sapiṇ ḍīkaraṇ am). It is clear that the creators of these additions were motivated by nothing but the desire to be seen to conform to the norms of brahmanical society once the Saivas had moved to extend recruit- ´ ment beyond the inevitably restricted circle of ascetics into the more numerous ranks of married householderṣFor these rituals and especially the Sr´ addhas ¯ make no sense in srictly Saiva terms, since initiates are held to attain liberation ´ as soon as they leave their bodies and therefore should require no ceremonies designed to ensure their well-being after deatḥ717 This accommodation of Brah 

716 The Saivas’ doctrines of the relationship between their scriptures and those of the ´ brahmanical tradition with respect both to householders and ascetics are examined in detail together with epigraphical evidence in SANDERSON forthcoming b. 

717 For a more detailed examination of the Saiva postmortuary rituals and their ra- ´ tionale see SANDERSON 1995a, pp. 31–38. They are not found in the preceding Pa¯supata tradition of the Atim ´ arga, in which the dead were buried, nor indeed in ¯ the earliest stage of the Mantramarga represented by the substantial ¯ Niśvāsa cor pus, which in this and numerous other respects remained close to its Atimargic āntecedents, appearing only in the Dīkṣottara, which was added to that corpus at a later date, and in several other later scriptures of the Siddhanta, most notably ¯ in the Kiraṇ a, whose treatment of the Sr´ addha rituals became the basis for that ¯ found in the Paddhati of Somasambhu and the later Paddhatis that followed its ´

manism no doubt gave Saivism a distinct advantage over those religions that ´ denied outright the authority of the brahmanical scriptures and there can be lit tle doubt that this would greatly have increased its acceptability in the eyes of kings, who could thus draw on the power of the new religion to sanctify their rule and enhance their might—the former predominantly through the Siddhanta, the ¯ latter predominantly through the S´ akta ¯ Saiva systems—while at the same time ´ maintaining their legitimacy in their ancient role as the protectors of the brah manical social order̥ 

As Saivism advanced by developing the strategies explored in this study it ´ achieved a transregional organization and a consequent standardization of its rituals and doctrines; and this transregional uniformity, I propose, would have heightened its appeal to kings by enabling it more easily to be perceived as a transcendent means of legitimation, empowerment, and the integration of re gional traditions, as an essential part of a pan-Indian socio-religious order that each kingdom sought to exemplify. It was by virtue of its great success in at tracting royal patronage that it came to exert such a pervasive influence on the religions around it; and it was also on the basis of this success that it could con struct the impressive edifice of a literature that is almost entirely silent about these vital but less elevated aspects of its life. 

leaḍ An intermediate stage in this development is probably to be recognized in the Sarvaj ñānottara and the Svāyambhuvas ¯utrasaṁ graha, which teach a cremation ritual for initiates but make no mention of Sr´ addha ritualṣI say that the ¯ Sr´ addhas ¯ make less sense in strictly Saiva terms, because some attempt was made to justify ´ crematioṇ To create their cremation ritual the Saivas adapted their ritual of initia- ´ tioṇ The soul of the deceased is to be drawn back into the corpse before it is burned on the pyre in order to undergo initiation, just as it did in life. Since the function of initiation is to liberate the soul by destroying all that impedes its liberation this re-initiation of the deceased was justified as a means of eliminating any obstacles that might still be present as a result of the initiate’s failure to expiate breaches of discipline that had not been expiated during his lifetime.

CONVENTIONS IN THE FOOTNOTES 

Where I have rejected the reading of a text-edition, inscription, or manu script, I have substituted my proposed reading and marked the point at which it begins with a superscript asterisk. Its end is indicated by the beginning of the parenthesis that followṣIn that I first state whether I judge the proposed read ing to be a simple correction (corr̥), an emendation (eṁ), a conjecture (conj.), or, in one case, a diagnostic conjecture (diagṇ conj.). By the last I mean a conjecture that restores what I take to be the intended meaning of the author while recog nizing that an alternative wording is possible. I maintain no clear-cut distinction between corrections, emendations, and conjectureṣI intend thereby only to dis tinguish approximately between three levels of decreasing obviousnesṣWhere the reading adopted is my own proposal no further information is addeḍ Where it has been proposed by another I have given the surname of the proposer af ter the abbreviation (e.g. eṁ MIRASHI). These abbeviations, or abbreviations followed by a name, are followed by a single space, a colon, and a single space, after which I have given the reading that I have rejecteḍ That is followed by an

abbreviation that indicates whether the source is the edition of the text (Eḍ) or inscription (Ep.) listed in the bibliography, or the manuscript (Coḍ) listed in the same. Where more than one manuscript has been cited, they are distinguished by the sigla assigned in the same. When I have given a translation of a passage in which I have rejected a reading or readings I indicate this in the translation only in the case of what I have classified as conjectures, e.g. ‘*Vidyesvaras on ´ the northern altar (conj.)’. Any testimonium is given in square brackets after the reading that it supportṣIn a few cases in which I have judged a word to have been lost I have inserted it between angle brackets (e.g. <ca>) and where I have judged that insertion to be less than certain I have followed it with a question mark (e.g. <svadharma?>). In my translations I have marked the cor responding words in the same way. Where I can offer no cure but judge that the intended meaning can be deduced from the context I have given that meaning in my translation enclosed between a superscript asterisk and a question mark in parenthesiṣWhere I judge a reading to be corrupt but can offer no cure even on the level of meaning alone I have marked the beginning of the reading with a superscript asterisk followed by a question mark in parenthesis, and marked the corresponding place in my translation with a superscript asterisk followed by three dots and a question mark in parentheseṣIn general I have standard ized the Sandhi and orthography of the Sanskrit in all citations, whether from texts or inscriptionṣAll translations of the text-passages that I have cited are my owṇ

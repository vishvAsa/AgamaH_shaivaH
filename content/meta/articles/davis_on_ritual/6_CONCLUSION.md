IN THE FINAL SECTION of the Sivapurana, after the wind-god Vayu has given  the eager sages of the Naimisa forest preliminary instruction in the siva jnana, he concludes his discourse with a statement about the character of  knowledge.  

Knowledge is said to be of two types, indirect (paroksa, literally "beyond one's  own sight") and direct. Indirect knowledge is unstable, they say, while direct  knowledge is very firm. Knowledge acquired through reasoning and instruction  is considered indirect knowledge; direct knowledge will arise through the most  excellent practice of ritual. Deciding that you cannot obtain moksa without direct  knowledge, you should exert yourselves assiduously to master this excellent  practice. ($Pur Vdyaviya 1.31.98-100)  

Vayu might seem here to undermine the authority of his own teachings.  After all, according to this dichotomy the mediated verbal instruction he has  just given the sages would be classified as indirect, unstable, and not lead ing to final liberation. But the sages are well-disposed to accept Vayu's  statement, since they have already been engaged in a sacrificial rite for a  thousand divine years in order to gain Vayu's presence in the first place.  Immediately understanding its implication, they ask to be tutored in the su 

perior ritual procedures so they can put them into practice themselves.  By now, we too should be able to assent to Vayu's claim, even if we do  not intend to follow his practical counsel. Saiva daily worship, one of those  most excellent ritual practices Vayu speaks of, has provided us with a privi leged entry point into the world as it was envisioned and acted upon by  medieval Saiva adepts and priests. By discursively reenacting Saiva piija  ourselves, we have seen how SivajMna is embedded in every detail of its  action and how this ritual engenders the direct, unmediated knowledge  Vayu declares is requisite to attaining liberation.  

Saiva nityapuja employs a series of synecdochic representations to offer  its practitioner a comprehensive vision of the Saiva world within a delimited  ritual terrain. Though by definition still fettered and limited in knowledge  and action, the worshiper can temporarily free himself from these limita 

tions within the sphere of puja. As he places mantras on his hands, removes  impurities from his body, or mentally constructs Siva's divine court, the  worshiper regularly employs the ordering principles of cosmic dynamism,  emission and reabsorption. As he reconstructs his body in self-purification,  he recapitulates the central passage of the soul from its condition of bondage  to liberation. When he imposes a variegated divine body onto the material164 * Conclusion    

linga and invokes Siva into it, he enacts a condensed theophany of the Lord  £iva, a ritual metonym of diva's variegated being. And when he offers sub stantive services, he brings the three ontological categories—Siva, bound  souls, and inanimate substance—into their proper and fundamental relation ship with one another.  

Through regular effort, as Vayu directs the sages, the worshiper could  "exert himself assiduously to master" this ritual, to complete in himself the  knowledge-in-action that would produce the highest fruits. For puja was not  just a vision of an imagined world, nor even of a reconstructed historical  world such as we have sought to enter, for the medieval Saiva siddhantins.  It was rather a way of seeing into the fundamental order of things, beyond  the human fetters that determine our partial viewpoint and our ignorance,  and of acting thereby with greater efficacy to higher ends, beyond the bonds  that normally suppress our active powers of consciousness.

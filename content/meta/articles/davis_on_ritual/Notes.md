## INTRODUCTION  

LOCATING THE TRADITION  

1. The scholarly literature on puja is not large, considering its importance within  Hindu traditions. For descriptions of puja in various schools, see James Burgess,  "The Ritual of Ramesvaram," Indian Antiquary 12 (1883): 313-26; T. Goudriaan,  "Vaikhanasa Daily Worship according to the handbooks of Atri, Bhrgu, Kasyapa,  and Marici," Indo-Iranian Journal 12 (1970): 161-215; R. V. Joshi, Le ritual de la  devotion Krsnaite (Pondich6ry: Institut Fransais d'Indologie, 1959); K. Ranga chari, The Sii Vaisnava Brahmans (Madras: Government Press, 1931); and Mrs.  Sinclair Stevenson, The Rites of the Twice-Born (London: Oxford University Press,  1920), pp. 368-400. The most useful translations of puja texts are those of Ηέΐέηβ  Brunner-Lachaux, Somaiambhupaddhati, premiere partie (Pondichdry: Institut  Franiais d'Indologie, 1963), and T. Goudriaan, Kasyapa's Book of Wisdom (The  Hague: Mouton, 1965). Two notable ethnographic accounts are Paul B. Courtright,  "On This Holy Day in My Humble Way: Aspects of Puja," in J. P. Waghome and  N. Cutler (eds.), Gods of Flesh/Gods of Stone (Chambersburg, Pa.: Anima Publica tions, 1985), pp. 33-50; and Akos Ostor, The Play of the Gods (Chicago: Univer sity of Chicago Press, 1980).  

2. The best general overview of Saiva siddhanta literature is Jan Gonda, Medi eval Religious Literature in Sanskrit (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1977). While  our knowledge of this corpus of texts has been substantially augmented since Gonda  wrote, largely through the effort of scholars associated with the Institut Franfais  d'Indologie in Pondichdry, there has not yet been any synthetic account incorporat ing this new information. I attempt to cite in these notes a large portion of recent  scholarly work, so a diligent reader may follow up on topics of interest.  

3. I use the 1975 devanagari edition of Kamikagama edited by C. Swaminatha siva. This edition virtually repeats the 1909 grantha text edited by Mayilai Ala gappa Mudaliar, which in turn was based on seven separate manuscripts. I have also  consulted a high-quality manuscript of KA formerly belonging to Sri Swaminatha  Sivacarya of Tiruvatuturai matha, now held by the Institut Fran;ais d'Indologie at  Pondichdry (T.298A). I use alternate readings based on this manuscript in a few  cases where they seem clearly preferable. For Kriyakramadyotika, I follow the 1927  grantha edition (based on four manuscript sources) published by the Jfianasamband ham Press in Cidambaram, which includes Nirmalamani's commentary. The 1967  edition of the South Indian Archakas Association follows the 1927 edition generally  but contains numerous mistakes and adds many apocryphal passages. It is clear  from a comparison of the texts that the 1927 edition of KKD is much truer to the text  as it was available to Nirmalamani in the sixteenth century. A critical edition of this  central Saiva siddhanta ritual text, based on thirty manuscripts, is currently being  prepared under the direction of S. S. Janaki at the Kuppuswami Sastri Research  Institute, Madras.

4. The authoritative dynastic history of the Colas remains K. A. Nilakantha Sas tri, The Colas (Madras: University of Madras, 1935).  

5. RSjaraja I adopted the practice of using a standardized meykkirtti to introduce  his inscriptions. For one example, see E. Hultzsch, "Inscriptions at Mamallapu ram," South Indian Inscriptions 1 (1890): 63-66.  

6. An excellent account of the temple, covering diverse topics, is J. M. Soma sundaram, The Great Temple at Tanjore (Madras: Solden & Co., 1935). For a re cent architectural description, see K. R. Srinivasan's account in Michael W. Meis ter (ed.), Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture: South India, Lower  

Dravidadesa (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1983), pp. 234—41.  7. These extensive inscriptions were edited and translated by E. Hultzsch, "Inscrip tions of the Tanjavur Temple," South Indian Inscriptions 2 (1891-1913). Useful  studies based primarily on this epigraphic material include: R. Nagaswamy, "South  Indian Temple—As an Employer," Indian Economic and Social History Review 2  (1965): 367-72; K. A. Nilakantha Sastri, "The Economy of a South Indian Temple  in the Cola Period," in A. B. Dhruva (ed.), Malaviya Commemoration Volume  (Benares: Benares Hindu University, 1932), pp. 305-19; George W. Spencer,  'Temple Money-Lending and Livestock Redistribution in Early Tanjore," Indian  Economic and Social History Review 5 (1968): 277-93; and George W. Spencer,  "Religious Networks and Royal Influence in Eleventh-Century South India," Jour nal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient 12 (1969): 42-56.  8. A local tradition, first reported by Bumell in 1879, claims that the liturgy of  the RajaiSjeSvara temple followed the Mtdcufagama (the "crown" agama, one of the  twenty-eight mulagamas). See A. C. Burnell, A Classified Index to the Sanskrit  Mss. in the Palace of Tanjore (London: Trubner & Co., 1879). The published edi tion of Makufagama, however, is highly corrupt; a critical edition would be neces sary before a reasonable assessment of this claim could be made. See C. Svami natha Sivacarya (ed.), Makufagama, piirvabhaga (Madras: South Indian Archakas  Association, 1977).  

9. Much of this brief depiction of "temple Hinduism" draws on the work of  Ronald Inden, through his published and unpublished writings, classes at the Uni versity of Chicago between 1978 and 1980, and many discussions since. For a dis cussion of temple Hinduism as a transformation of previous ideological formations,  see R. Inden, "The Ceremony of the Great Gift (Mahadana): Structure and His torical Context in Indian Ritual and Society," Asie du Sud, traditions et change ments, Colloques Internationaux du CNRS, no. 582 (Paris: Editions du Centre na tional de la recherche scientifique, 1979), pp. 131-36. Nicholas Dirks, "Political  Authority and Structural Change in Early South Indian History," Indian Economic  and Social History Review 13 (1976): 125-58, is also useful in specifying this trans formation. Other pertinent articles by Inden include "The Ceremonial Bath of the  Hindu King of Kings" and "Imperial Formations, Imperial Puranas" (both un published).  

10. For accounts of the varied activities of medieval South Indian temples, see  the well-titled essay by Κ. V. Soundara Rajan, "The Kaleidoscopic Activities of  Medieval Temples in the Tamilnad," Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society 42  (1952): 87—101; and Burton Stein, "The Economic Function of a Medieval South  Indian Temple," Journal of Asian Studies 19 (1960): 163-76. Three important dis-

cussions of the general role of temple and temple ritual in medieval South Indian  society and politics are: A. Appadurai and C. A. Breckenridge, "The South Indian  Temple: Authority, Honour and Redistribution," Contributions to Indian Sociology  10 (1976): 187-211; Nicholas B. Dirks, The HoUow Crown: Ethnohistory of an  Indian Kingdom (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987); and Burton  Stein, Peasant State and Society in Medieval South India (New Delhi: Oxford Uni versity Press, 1980).

Narayanakantha quotes a verse of Utpaladeva, who lived probably in the mid ninth century; Ksemaraja's commentary on the SvaT, composed in the eleventh  century, in turn quotes Narayanakantha's MrAV. See Bhatt (ed.), MPA 1 p. xii, and  Brunner-Lachaux (trans.), MrA (Section des rites), p. vii and n. 6.  

20. Ηέΐέηε Brunner touches briefly on these points of disagreement in "Impor tance de la littdrature agamique pour l'6tude des religions vivantes de TInde," In dologica Taurinensia 3-4 (1975—1976): 107—24. On the various lists of tattvas, see  Bhatt, "Introduction," MPA 1 pp. xxi-xxiv. Surendranath Dasgupta summarizes the  philosophical positions of several agamas and related texts (including MPA, PA,  V$A, and SPur) in A History of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 5: The Southern Schools of  Saivism (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1922-1975).  

21. Compare Abhinavagupta's account (in Tantraloka, ch. 36) of the division of  agama-based Saivism into three propensities, as K. C. Pandey summarizes it:  

[Siva] instructed the sage, Durvasas, to revive the Saivagamic teaching. The sage  accordingly divided all the saivagamas into 3 classes according as they taught mo nism, dualism or monism-cum-dualism, imparted their knowledge to his 3 mind-bora  sons, Tryambaka, Amardaka, and Srinatha respectively, and charged each one of  them separately with the mission of spreading the knowledge of their respective  Agamas. Thus there came into existence three Saiva Tantric Schools, each known by  the name of the first earthly progenitor.

22. David N. Lorenzen discusses these and many other references to the four  (most often) Saiva schools. See The Kdpalikas and Kalamukhas: Two Lost Saivite  Sects (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1972), pp. 1-12. For a general  summary of several individual schools of Saivism, see also Pranabananda Jash, His 

tory of Saivism (Calcutta: Roy and Chaudhury, 1974).  

23. Ηέΐέηε Brunner discusses the Saiva siddhanta characterization of its main  Saiva competitor in "The PaSupatas as seen by the Saivas," Schriften zur Geschichte  und Kultur des alien Orients 18 (1986): 513-20.  

24. Significant secondary sources concerning Saiva siddhanta monastic lineages  include: R. D. Baneiji, The Haihayas of Tripuri and Their Monuments, Memoirs of  the Archaeological Survey of India, no. 23 (Calcutta: Government of India, 1931);  V. V. Mirashi, "The Saiva Acaryas of the Mattamayiira Clan," Indian Historical  Quarterly 26 (1950): 1-16; V. V. Mirashi (ed.), Inscriptions of the Kalachuri-Chedi  Era, Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, vol. 4 (Ootacamund: Government Epigraph ist for India, 1955); J. Van Troy, "The Social Structure of the Saiva-siddhantika  Ascetics (700-1300 A.D.)," Indica 11 (1974): 77-86; B.G.L. Swamy, "The Golaki  School of Saivism in the Tamil Country," Journal of Indian History 53 (1975):  167-209; and Cynthia Talbot, "Golaki Matha Inscriptions from Andhra Pradesh: A  Study of a Saiva Monastic Lineage," in Vajapeya: Essays on Evolution of Indian Art  and Culture (Delhi: Agam Kala Prakashan, 1987), pp. 133-46. For Southeast Asia,  see K. Bhattacharya, Les religions brahmaniques dans I'Ancien Cambodge (Paris:  Ecole Franfaise d' Extreme-Orient, 1961).  

25. As a tenth-century inscription from Madhya Pradesh refers to one important  Saiva siddhanta branch, the Mattamayiira. See F. Kielhorn, "A Stone Inscription  from Ranod (Narod)," Epigraphia Indica 1 (1892): 351-61.  

26. As Brunner puts it, the paddhatis aim at "unification of the often contradic tory teachings of the agamas, and have performed their function so well that they  have ended up somewhat eclipsing the agamas themselves" ("Importance de la  litt&ature agamique," p. 110).  

27. On AghoraSiva's life, see Wayne Surdam, "South Indian Saiva Rites of Initi ation: "The DHc§avidhi' of AghoraSivacarya's 'Kriyakramadyotika'" (Ph.D. disserta tion, University of California, Berkeley, 1984), pp. xvi-xxi. AghoraSiva's known  works are listed in V. Raghavan, New Catalogus Catalogorum (Madras: University  of Madras, 1968), vol. 1, pp. 58-59.1 have attempted to summarize the intellectual  background of Aghorasiva in "Aghora&va's Background," in Dr. S. S. JanaM Sha shtyabdapurti Commemoration Volume (Madras: Kuppuswami Sastri Research In stitute, forthcoming).  

28. For two scholarly summaries of Saiva siddhanta doctrine based on the  paddhati literature, see Rohan A. Dunuwila, Saiva Siddhanta Theology: A Context  for Hindu-Christian Dialogue (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1985) (based primarily  on Bhojadeva's TP); and K. C. Pandey, An Outline of History of Saiva Philosophy  (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1986) (first printed in 1955 as Bhaskari, vol. 3). Jayan 

dra Soni, Philosophical Anthropology in Saiva Siddhanta (Delhi: Motilal Banar sidass, 1989), is based primarily on the works of the sixteenth-century Saiva author  Sivagrayogin.  

29. The best general account of the Tamil version of Saiva siddhanta is M. Dha-

Notes to Introduction · 169    

vamony. Love of God according to Saiva Siddheinta (Oxford: Clarendon Press,  1971). Also useful are the collected lectures of V. A. Devasenapathy, with the  excellent title Of Human Bondage and Divine Grace (Cidambaram: Annamalai  University, 1963), and the study of K. Sivaraman, Saivism in Philosophical Per 

spective (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1973). A primary agenda of most historical  scholarship on Tamil Saiva siddhanta works of the thirteenth century and later has  been to develop a genealogy relating these texts directly to the works of the Tamil  nayanmars of the sixth through ninth centuries. Such studies generally pay lip ser 

vice to the role of the agamas in the philosophical system of Meykantar and his fol lowers, but they do not seriously investigate the connections between the Sanskrit  dgama literature and the later Tamil works.  

30. The only critical work devoted to this, as far as I know, is the brief discus sion by Brunner, "Importance de la littirature agamique," pp. 118-19. For another  example of a Saiva author working in both Sanskrit and Tamil, see Bruno Dagens's  discussion of the sixteenth-century commentator Vedajfiana/Maiaifiagatecikar, in  "Introduction," SPM, pp. 5-15. I am indebted to Dagens for leading me to recon sider the relation of Sanskrit and Tamil Saiva siddhanta literature.  

31. On the poetry of the nayanmars, see especially the recent study and transla tions by Indira Peterson, Poems to Siva (Princeton: Princeton University Press,  1989).  

32. On the use of texts in contemporary temple practice, see Carl Gustav Diehl,  Instrument and Purpose: Studies on Rites and Rituals of South India (Lund: C.W.K.  Gleerup, 1956). For a portrait of a Saiva priestly community in theological disarray,  see Chris Fuller's fascinating ethnography on the Madurai Mmak§i-Sundare£varar  temple priests, Servants of the Goddess: The Priests of a South Indian Temple  (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984).  

33. G. U. Pope (trans.), The nruvacagam, or "Sacred Utterances" of the Tamil  Poet, Saint, and Sage ManHckavacagar (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1900), p. lxxiv.  The same position turns up repeatedly in general works on Saivism and Hinduism.  For instances, see: M. Dhavamony, "Saivism: Saiva Siddhanta," in Mircea Eliade  (ed.), Encyclopedia of Religion (New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1987), vol.  13, p. 11; and Thomas J. Hopkins, The Hindu Religious Tradition (Encino, Cal.:  Dickenson Publishing Co., 1971), p. 118.  

34. For a more skeptical discussion of the question of integration between jnana  and kriya, see Ηέΐέηβ Branner-Lachaux, "Introduction," MrA (Section des rites),  esp. pp. xlii-xliii.  

35. The texts set out an ideal program for worship that only the highly adept and  devout could follow completely. Yet they also recognize and allow for individual  variations and shortcuts in phrases repeated throughout, such as yathaiakti (in ac cord with one's capacity).  

36. Agnipurana (ch. 72-106), LiAgapurana, and Sivapurana (Vayaviyasamhita  ch. 16-20) clearly articulate siddhanta positions. (Brunner briefly discusses the pu ranic usage of agamic material in "Importance de la littirature agamique," pp. 117  and 121.) Silpaiastras such as MM also reflect Saiva siddhanta practice, but through  the eyes of the sthapati rather than the acarya.  

37. I mention in the notes some of the disputes and differing formulations within 

170 · Notes to Chapter One    

the Saiva siddhanta order. In her translation of SP, and particularly in vol. 3,  Ηέΐέηβ Brunner-Lachaux presents a much more variegated portrait of Saiva sid dhanta literature, focusing repeatedly on doctrinal discussion within the order.  

CHAPTER ONE  

RITUAL AND HUMAN POWERS  

1. Some Saiva texts add "volition" (iccha) as a third inherent power of con sciousness.  

2. The agamas of course recognize that not everyone seeks mok$a in this lifetime;  the world includes bubhukfus ("seekers of worldly enjoyments") as well as mumukfus  ("seekers of liberation"). But worldly powers and liberation do not lie along radi cally differing courses of action. Both result from the removal of fetters and the  manifestation of inherent powers. Sadhakas (mantra-adepts), for instance, employ  Saiva ritual and knowledge to gain specific worldly powers. For a full discussion,  see Ηέΐέηε Brunner, "Le sadhaka, personnage oubli6 du Sivaisme du Sud," Journal  asiatique 263 (1975): 411-43.  

3. Contrary to what many modern advocates of Saiva siddhanta have held, the  igamas do not portray themselves as derived from or in any way subordinate to the  Vedas. On this matter, Ηέΐέηε Brunner's "Le Saiva-siddhanta, 'Essence' du Veda,"  Indologica Taurinensia 8 (1980-1981): 51-66, is a welcome statement. For a some 

what different formulation, see Richard Davis, "Cremation and Liberation: A Saiva  siddhanta Revision," History of Religions 28 (1988): 37-53. Wayne Surdam, "The  Vedicization of Saiva Ritual," in S. S. Janaki (ed.), Siva Temple and Temple Ritu als (Madras: Kuppuswami Sastri Research Institute, 1988), pp. 52-60, deals with  the relationship as it has changed over time.  

4. MrAVD vidya 1.20, from Michel Hulin's French translation.  5. Kamikagama refers to this useful technique as an analogy to the efficacy of  "interior worship":  

Visualizing with his mind, he should daily worship ParameSvara in this imagined  temple, using substances that are mentally constructed. As a guru meditates that  he is Garuda and obtains the result of removing [poison, even though done mentally],  so here also one obtains the desired benefits [resulting from worship], (KA 4.189- 90)  

6. This useful convention I owe to Ηέΐέηε Brunner-Lachaux, who has employed  it in her translations and studies of saivagama.  

7. Nirmalamam understands the Saiva form of meditation, in its concern to estab lish a relationship between meditator and divinity, to differ from Pataiijali yoga:  'Toga is the close connection (sambandha) during meditation with the object of  meditation; not, as in Patafijali, the condition of samadhr (KKDP, translated in  Surdam, "South Indian Saiva Rites," p. lv, n. 102).  

8. KarA, cited by NirmaIamaQi in KKDP, and quoted in Janaki, ML p. 2.  9. For detailed discussion of mudras in Saiva ritual, see the series of six articles  by S. S. Janaki, "Saiva Mudras I-VI," Kalakshetra Quarterly 5-6 (1983-1984).  Photographs of the mudras may be found in those articles and also in SP 1, Plate 1,  "Mudra," and in Surdam, "South Indian Saiva Rites," Appendix, pp. 276-313. In 

Notes to Chapter One · 171    

S. S. Janaki (ed.), ML, line drawings of mudrds following ML prescriptions are  provided.  

10. V$A, from Brunner-Lachaux's French translation, SP 1 p. xxxi.  11. On the grammar of Saiva mantras, see Ηέΐέηβ Brunner-Lachaux's brief dis cussion in SP 1 pp. xxxi-xxxii. Brunner-Lachaux also includes a list of the mantras  employed in nityapuja in SP 1, Appendix 3, "Mantras utilises pendant Ie culte de  Siva (d'apr&s Somasambhu)."  

12. Vedajfiana apparently quotes MPA here. Other authors construct similar  scales of forms: "Proponents of various schools describe the inherent form of the  highest mokfa in various ways, each in accord with its own views." With this pref ace, Sivagrayogin considers, and criticizes, a whole series of alleged mok$a& held by  other schools (&Pbh pp. 335-52), including the Sivasdmya views of AghoraSiva that  I take here as normative.  

13. This includes both purva and uttara portions of the text. For a summary of  the contents of KA, purvabhaga, see Bruno Dagens, "Analyse du Purvaka mikagama," Bulletin de I'Ecole Frangaise d'Extreme-Orient 54 (1977): 1-38.  Dagens's rdsum6 is based on N. R. Bhatt's Sanskrit upodghata, in KA, purvabhaga,  pp. iii-xx. Two other agama r6sum6s are available: Ηέΐδηε Brunner, "Analyse du  Kiranagama," Journal asiatique 253 (1965): 309-28; and Brunner, "Analyse du Su prabhedagama," Journal asiatique 255 (1967): 31-60. These two dgamas cover a  more modest array of rituals but are noteworthy for containing all four padas of a  proper agama.  

14. SupA, quoted in SASS p. 58.  

15. The dgamas generally present atmartha and pardrtha as two variants of a  single scheme of piijd, and following their lead I will describe Saiva daily worship  in this study as a ritual unity. However, there are some practical differences be tween the two. Ηόΐέηε Brunner compares them in greater detail in "Atmarthapuja  versus Pararthapuja in the Saiva Tradition," in T. Goudriaan (ed.), The Sanskrit  Tradition and Tantrism (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1990), pp. 4—23. She argues that the  integral model of piijd assumed by later Saiva literature in fact results historically  from the combining of two originally distinct styles of worship, one an "old public  worship" of a rudimentary sort, and the other an inner-oriented "private worship"  maintained by yogic adepts.  

16. Frits Staal has discussed the "embedding" of ritual units within one another  to constitute larger ritual wholes in the Vedic system: "Ritual Syntax," in M. Naga tomi et al. (eds.), Sanskrit and Indian Studies: Essays in Honour of Daniel Η. H.  Ingalls (Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing Co., 1980), pp. 119-42. As will be clear  throughout this study, I depart strongly from Staal's view that such embeddings are  the empty exercise of syntactic elements without discursive significance.  

17. Svatantra, quoted by Nirmalamani in KKDP p. 293, cited in SP 3 p. 9.  18. To assist those who wish to reenact Saiva piijd visually as well as mentally,  the Kuppuswami Sastri Research Institute has recently made available an excellent  videotape of K. A. Sabharatna Sivacarya performing an dgama-based worship of  Siva, with comentaiy in English or Tamil. Readers wishing to obtain a copy may  contact Ginni Ishimatsu, Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies, Univer sity of California, Berkeley, CA 94702, or Richard Davis, Department of Religious  Studies, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520.

CHAPTER TWO  

OSCILLATION IN THE RITUAL UNIVERSE  

1. The classic 1918 essay by A. K. Coomaraswamy, "The Dance of Shiva," in  The Dance of Shiva (New Delhi: Sagar Publications, 1969), pp. 66-78, remains the  best published account of the significance of Nafaraja as explicated by Tamil Saiva  siddhanta authors. On the origin of this iconic form, there is considerable scholarly  debate. Starting about 970 C.E. the dowager Cola queen Sembiyan MahadevI,  grandmother of Rajaraja, began placing Natarija in a prominent position on the exte 

rior walls of the temples she sponsored, and I would date the elevation of Nafaraja  to most-favored status among Cola images of Siva to her initiative.  2. The Saiva scheme of tattvas clearly draws upon the Samkhya model of emanat ing prakrti but surpasses it by adding additional tattvas and an entire domain, the  pure domain, not envisioned within Samkhya circles. See Dasgupta, History, Vol. 5:  Southern Schools, pp. 164—70, for some discussion of Saiva siddhanta in relation to  Samkhya.  

3. On the emission of language and the alphabet, see KA 2.4—7. Ramakantha gives  a more sophisticated treatment of language in the Saiva siddhanta universe in his  Nddakarika (with a commentary by AghoraSiva), included also in his KalAV (l.S).  See Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat, "Les Nadakarika de RamakaQfha," Bulletin de I'Ecole  Frangaise d'Extreme-Orient 73 (1984): 223-35, for a translation and informed ex 

plication.  

4. For a general study of nyasa as a ritual technique, see Andre Padoux, "Contri butions a l'6tude du mantraSastra," Bulletin de I'Ecole Frangaise d'Extreme-Orient  67 (1980): 59-102.  

5. Further aspects of the five mantras are set forth by Brunner-Lachaux in SP 1,  Appendix 6, 'Xjuelques correspondences entre les visages de SadaSiva et Ie Cosmos."  6. Some texts omit NETRA from the set of angamantras, which may account for its  distinctive treatment in karunyasa and elsewhere.  

7. A much more detailed treatment of Siva's angas may be found in Ηέΐέηβ Brun ner, "Les members de Siva," Asiatische Studien 40 (1986): 89-132.  8. Mj-A kriya 3.3 offers an exception. Here the weapon mantra ASTRA should be  placed on the index finger (tarjani, literally the "threatening finger") because ASTRA  is the mantra that "threatens intruders."  

9. See Brunner-Lachaux, SP 1, Appendix 5, "Purification du corps grassier: les  cinq mandala des 616ments," for a r6sum6 of the features of each domain.  10. A shorter alternative method of bodily purification described in both KKD  and KA involves visualizing the body as an upside-down tree and progressively de stroying it (KKD p. 59).

13. The classic secondary account of vastumandala is Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu  Temple, vol. 1, pp. 19-97. Kramrisch utilizes Saiva siddhanta texts, particularly  IP, as well as texts belonging to many other schools, for her synthetic description.  Some of the relevant chapters of IP are translated by Kramrisch in "ISanaSivagu 

rudevapaddhati Kriyapada Chs. xxvi, xxvn," Journal of the Indian Society of Ori ental Art 9 (1941): 151-93; and 'Temple, Door, Throne, Etc.," Journal of the In dian Society of Oriented Art 10 (1942): 210-52 (which translates IP kriya ch. 5, 7,  12, and 13).

CHAPTER THREE  

BECOMING Λ SIVA  

1. V. A. Devasenapathy cites the pleasing analogy of a prince raised among  gypsies:  

The soul is like a prince kidnapped in his infancy by gipsies and brought up by them  in ignorance of his real identity. It is natural for the prince in such a state to behave in  gipsy ways mistaking these as natural to him. But when the king comes and reveals his  identity, the prince will give up his gipsy ways and conduct himself as befits a prince.  

V. A. Devasenapathy, OfHuman Bondage and Divine Grace (Cidambaram: Anna malai University, 1963), p. 48.1 have not been able to locate the textual source of  this simile.  

2. Saiva texts refer to two other categories of fetters: tirobhava (or rodhiakti)  and mahamaya. Tirobh&va, Siva's power of obscuration, is a fetter only in a secon dary sense, says AghoraSiva, while mahamaya affects only beings such as the  VidyeSvaras who dwell in the pure domain (^uddhadhvan) (TPV 17).  

3. The hierarchy of souls described in Chapter 1 is based on the presence or  absence of these three fetters. As bound souls, sakalas, we are affected by all three  categories of fetters (TP 8-15).  

4. The monist commentator Snkumara, discussing Bhojadeva's TP, claims that  the ripening of mala is brought about by the "fire of knowledge" (TPD 9), but  AghoraSiva firmly denies this (TPV 15).  

5. Ηέΐέηβ Brunner-Lachaux discusses the Saiva understanding of karman and its  three types in SP 3 pp. xxii-xxvi.  

6. Saiva authors differ from one another in their discussions of iaktinipata.  SomaSambhu, for instance, identifies saktinipata with the act of initiation, while  AghoraSiva and most subsequent authors view it as a necessary precursor to receiv ing initiation. For helpful discussions of this philosophically ambiguous phenome non, see Brunner-Lachaux, SP 3 p. viii, and Surdam, "South Indian Saiva Rites,"  pp. cxiv-cxxi.  

7. My descriptions of Saiva diksas are based largely on the SP and KKD. For  translations of samayadiksa procedures, see SP 3 pp. 2-110, and Surdam, "South  Indian Saiva Rites," pp. 1-97.  

8. On the several stages of initiation and corresponding ritual competencies, see  Brunner, "Le sadhaka," Journal asiatique 263 (1975): 411-43.  9. Translations of vi§e$adiks& procedures: SP 3 pp. 112-56, and Surdam, "South  Indian Saiva Rites," pp. 98-112. Brunner-Lachaux argues that samaya and visesa  were initially two phases of a single ritual and were separated into distinct rituals at  a fairly late date (SP 3 pp. xxx-xxxiii); these two in turn may have at an earlier date  been separated from nirvanadlksa, the originally unitary Saiva diksa. To gain an idea  of the variety of Saiva treatments of dikfa generally, see N. R. Bhatt, "Introduc tion," MPA 2 pp. xviii-xxiii.  

10. See SP 3 pp. 157—426, and Surdam, "South Indian Saiva Rites," pp. 113—  271. The amount of discussion SomaSambhu and AghoraSiva devote to each of the  three types of dik$a offer a good initial index of their importance in the Saiva scheme 

Notes to Chapter Four · 175    

of things: in Surdam's translation of KKD, samayadikja gets 96 pages, viiesadiksa 14  pages, and nirvanadlksd 1S8 pages.  

11. Texts refer to this method only as tadanadi, "the set of actions beginning with  striking." For a more detailed discussion of "transportation," see SP 3 pp. 118-25,  and Plates 1 and 2, "Transport de Yatman depuis Ie Coeur du disciple jusqu'k la  matrice de VagTsvan."  

12. The method described here, focusing on five kolas, is only one of six possi ble "paths" (adhvan) along which initiation may proceed: mantras, words, pho nemes, worlds, tattvas, and kalas. As the quotation from UKA below indicates,  however, Saiva siddhanta understands the kalas to encompass the constituents of  the other paths, and hence the method of kola purification offers a more comprehen sive means of dikja (at least from the time of SomaSambhu). On the sixfold path, see  Brunner-Lachaux, SP 3 pp. xiii-xxii.  

13. In SP 3, Brunner-Lachaux provides charts summarizing these englobements:  see Plate 5, "Englobement des rdalitds de TUniverse par Ies cinq kalS'\ Plate 6,  "Ripartition des tattva selon Ies cinq kalS'·, and Plates 7 A-E, displaying the worlds  encompassed within each of the five kalas.  

14. After nirvanadikjd, a Saiva initiate may undergo special additional consecra tions (abhifeku) that grant him particular capacities for action. Most common is the  "priestly consecration" (acaryabhiseka), enabling the recipient to act as priest in per forming rituals on behalf of others. Another consecration grants special mantra  

powers to the adept (sadhakabhiseka). For Soma£ambhu's account of these conse crations, see SP 3 pp. 455-524.  

15. Nirmalamani distinguishes the efficacy of atmaSuddhi according to the wor shiper's stage of initiation. For one who has undergone samayadiksa but not  nirvdnadiksa, atmaxuddhi destroys any obstructions that prevent mantras from  achieving their purposes; for those who have undergone nirvdnadiksa, by contrast, it  helps complete initiation by destroying all newly arisen karman (KKDP p. 60).  

16. See SP 1, Appendix 5, "Purification du corps grossier," for a chart of the  gunas located in each of the five bhutas.  

17. See Brunner-Lachaux's detailed discussion of this parallelism, in SP 3 pp.  396-405.  

18. SomaSambhu's prescriptions for antye$ti are translated in SP 3 pp. 567-618.  For a general discussion of this ritual in the Saiva system, see Davis, "Cremation  and Liberation."

5. AcA, quoted in SPbh p. 63.  

6. In his "Compendium of All Schools" (SDS), the monist author Madhava dis-

176 · Notes to Chapter Four    

cusses the views of Saiva siddhanta (iaivadariana) in chapter 7. He bases his de scription primarily on the MfA and Narayanakantha's commentary MfAV, on Bho jadeva's TP and AghoraSiva's TPV; he also employs KirA, PA, SP, and a very few  other texts. The passage here relies on MrAV 3.8. See Ηέΐέηβ Brunner's expert trans lation, "Un chapitre du Sarvadarianasanigraham. Le Saivadariana," in Michel Strick man (ed.), Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honour of R. A. Stein (Brussels: Institut  Beige des Hautes Etudes Chinoises, 1981), pp. 96-140.  

7. For general treatments of the lithic forms and iconographic representations of  SadaSiva, see Brijendra Nath Sharma, Iconography of SadMiva (Delhi: Abhinav  Publications, 1976), and Thomas S. Maxwell, "The Five Aspects of Siva (In The ory, Iconography and Architecture)," Arts International 25 (1982): 41-57.  

8. The list of angas is consistent, but the attributes vary somewhat from text to  text. Compare for instance the discussions in SP 1.3.72-74 and KKD pp. 108-9. As  noted in the previous chapter and implied in the passage quoted here, the angas are  closely related to Ihe six divine qualities (guna) of Siva, acquired also by the initiate  in dlkfd. See Brunner's two long footnotes on the subject, SP 3 pp. 396-405.  

9. The set of weapons held by Sadasiva varies slightly from text to text. KA  specifies two possible sets (4.332-34), while AghoraSiva gives three alternatives  (KKD pp. 98-99). SP 1, Plate 7, "Ayudha de SadaSiva," lists eight different sets of  SadaSiva's weapons attested in diverse agamas. However different, these sets gen erally encompass all the various weapons associated with Siva in his iconic  

(MaheSvara) forms.  

10. Retellings of Siva's puranic escapades are conveniently available in Wendy  Doniger O'Flaherty, Siva: The Erotic Ascetic (Oxford: Oxford University Press,  1973), and Stella Kramrisch, The Presence of Hiva (Princeton: Princeton University  Press, 1981).  

11. RA 2 ch. 35. In his "Preface," N. R. Bhatt concisely summarizes the  MaheSvara forms described in various agama texts (RA 2 pp. ix-xi). Also in this  volume may be found drawings of these forms based on agama prescription.  

12. VA 63.4-5, quoted in SPM 5.151-54. As Dagens notes, the passage  Vedajfiana cites does not include the expected pentad of samharanuirtis.  13. See for instance SP 3.1.27-28, where the guru identifies himself with all five  manifestations of Siva.  

14. For a further discussion of the relationship between "mental" and "concrete"  divine images in Saiva worship, see Ηέΐέηε Brunner, "L'Image Divine dans Ie  Culte Agamique de Siva: Rapport entre 1'image mentale et Ie support concrete du  culte," L'Image Divine. Culte et Meditation dans VHindomsme (Paris: Editions du  Centre national de la recherche scientifique, 1990), pp. 9-29.  

15. This is not to say that all lingas are the same. MM goes on to describe a great  many categories of lingas, made of different substances and according to different  dimensions, appropriate for various types of worshipers (MM 33.72-92).  

16. Ηόΐέηε Brunner, "Toujours Ie Niskala-linga," Journal asiatique 256 (1968):  445-47.

I  thank the author for sending me proofs of her essay at the time I was revising this  chapter. 

Notes to Chapter Four · 177    

17. See for instance KKD ^ivapratisthavidhi, p. 2. Similar sets of eighteen rites  are prescribed for the establishment of an image (pnuimapratiffha) (KA 68.1-6).  18. For a more detailed examination of the reuse of Puru§a imagery in an early  Vaisnava establishment ritual, see Shantanu Phukan, "From the Idol to the Icon:  The Transformation in the Pratima Prati§thana Ceremony" (unpublished).  19. The majority of agamas holds that the divine throne extends from Earth up  to fuddhavidya (KA 4.312, SP 1.3.S6, AA 20.157). Another school of thought, ad hered to by KirA and Narayanakantha, argues that the divine throne extends all the way  up to the Saktitattva (MrAV kriya 3.12).  

20. See Figure 9 here and the more detailed chart of throne stages in SP 1, Plate  5, "Asana-puja."  

21. The identity of this particular Sakti is not certain. She is variously assimi lated to Kurwjalinl, KriyaSakti, and IcchaSakti. (See Brunner's discussion, SP 1 p.  156.) What is never in dispute is that it must be a differentiated form of Sakti at the  base of the divine throne.  

22. The ndga-like description of Ananta in KA calls to mind another famous An anta: the cosmic snake who serves as the couch of Visnu-Narayana. Hie VidyeSvara  Ananta is never identified with Visnu's great servant, but the snake imagery is fre quent enough to suggest that the throne of Visnu has been incorporated into Siva's  more encompassing divine throne. (Brunner raises the question of Ananta's iden tity, in SP 1 pp. 158-60.)  

23. See Brunner's list of the Saktis and the VidyeSvaras, together with her dis cussion of the identity of these Saktis, SP 1 pp. 166-68. It is noteworthy that the  names of the Saktis "are the feminine equivalents of the divine names associated  with Vamadeva in the Taittiriya Aranyaka mantra, whose division served to form the  38 kola of SadaSiva."  

24. These three categories generally include the tattvas of the impure domain as  follows:  

iiva—maya  

vidya—six tattvas from kala to puru$a  

atman—twenty-four tattvas from prakrti to Earth  

These three tattvas also pervade the body: see SP 3, Plate 14, "Decoupage du corps  par Ies trois tattva."  

25. As an alternative method of visualizing the divine throne, Kamikagama de scribes it as a lotus that unfolds as the worshiper constructs it.  

The pedestal is fixed upon all paths (adhvan). Its great feet are the four ages of the  world. Its bulb is the element Earth. The upraised stalk constitutes the tattvas up to  Time. It is decorated with thorns which are the fifty kinds of emotions. Its main node  is the mayatattva. The broad lotus flower is iuddhavidya. The petals are the  VidyeSvaras. This lotus is ornamented with stamens which are the Saktis, and made  splendid by a pericarp and seed where the couple Siva and Sakti are located. (KA  4.316-19)  

Here again the form of the divine throne encompasses both all the constituents of the  impure domain (worlds, ages, tattvas, states of emotion) and the powers or agents  of Siva through which he governs (VidyeSvaras, eight Saktis, Siva and Sakti). 

178 · Notes to Chapter Five    

(Compare KirA kriya 2.19-22 and SSV 48.) Like the divine throne of five stages,  tbis lotus-form throne is a comprehensive ritual construction embodying diva's ac tive presence in the world.  

26. I follow here the account in AA, which differs somewhat from KA and KKD,  primarily because the description in AA seems to me clearer. The main difference  lies in the distinction between siik$mamiirti and vidyadeha.  

21. According to Appayadiksita, still other constituents of reality are contained in  the vidyadeha: the kolas, adhvans, bhuvanas, agamas, and so on ($AC pp. 56-59).  The vidyadeha is of course an inclusive body. Appaya's emphasis on this point  here, however, may relate to his monistic perspective. If Siva is considered the  material as well as instrumental cause of the world, then his SadaSiva form can and  should include all manifest realities as well as his instrumentalities.  

28. There are in fact several formulations of the MOLA mantra, according to the  Siddhantabodha, appropriate to different categories of worshipers. See Brunner Lachaux, "Introduction," SP 1 pp. xxxii-xxxiii. The name PRASADA for this mantra  suggests a homology between mantra and temple (also prasada). Brunner-Lachaux  points to this when describing the final dissolution of the mantra into ParamaSi va:  'This is the summit of the PRASADA: the temple, which is at the same time the tem ple of the body, the complete domain of manifestation, and the mantra that con structs it in ascending it" (SP 1 p. 186, n. 1).  

29. According to Anantasambhu, each portion of the mantra is characterized by  a name, a form, an illumination or color (abha), a pervasion, a location, a duration  of pronunciation (m&tra), a path, and a presiding lord (SSV 37). SP 1, Plate 6,  "Recitation du Prasada-mantra," gives a relatively complete depiction of the man 

tra portions. One may also compare the three additional diagrams of mantra por tions, based on three different texts, in SP 3, Plates 11-13.  

30. This point was emphasized to me by Sabharatna Sivacarya (depicted in these  photographs), who spoke of ascending pronunciation in invocation as the single  most difficult ritual procedure in daily worship. The coordination of simultaneous  actions requires much concentration and training.  

CHAPTER FIVE  

RELATIONS OF WORSHIP  

1. This episode is the frame-story of the MataAgaparameivaragama, the teach ings given by ParameSvara to MataAga: see MPA vidya 1.1-34.  2. There are two main types of arghya: common (samanyarghya) and special  (yiiefarghiya). Common arghya is used generally for rites directed toward subordi nate deities, while special arghya must be used in worshiping Siva. As Brunner Lachaux puts it, "The difference between these two arghya& resides in their com position, but particularly in the nature of the mantras that one recites over the  recipient" (SP 1 p. 138).  

3. KA 5.33-36 gives several alternative sets of substances for preparing arghya,  though the group of eight listed here is the most common set.  

4. Nirmalamani quotes Bhojadeva in describing the formation of the cow mudra:  "When the fingers are woven together by joining little finger with ring finger, and 

Notes to Chapter Five · 179    

middle finger with index finger, the cow mudra will resemble the udder of a cow"  CKKDP p. 46).  

5. The divyamudra employed in this divyadr$fi is described in ML pp. 19-20,  quoted in KKDP pp. 130-31. See the photograph of divyadrsti employed upon enter ing the temple, in ML p. 27.  

6. Attributed to KA by SASS p. 109. Cited in SP 1 p. 101.  

7. The themes may vary in proportion according to the situation of worship.  Texts like KKD that deal with atmartha worship in a private shrine generally stress  acts of hospitality, while KA and other texts prescribing public (parartha) temple  worship give greater emphasis to Siva's lordship. For a fuller account of these di 

vergences between atmartha and parartha, see Brunner, "Atmarthapfija versus  Panirthapfija," pp. 7-12.  

8. See also the lists of twelve, sixteen, and twenty-four upacaras given by KarA,  in SP 1, Appendix 7, "Upacara du culte de Siva."  

9. J. Filliozat and P. Z. Pattabinunin, Parures divines du Sud de Vbide (Pondi chiry: Institut Frangais d'Indologie, 1966), photographically documents the crowns  and ornaments used to decorate the IiAgas and images in South Indian temples.  10. IP p. 56, quoted in SP 1 p. 213.  

11. Some texts provide suitable panegyric. In KKD (pp. 121-23), for instance,  AghoraSiva quotes the stotra& from RA, KirA, KalA, and MPA.  12. Much of this discussion of nirmalya is based on $AC pp. 111-26. This was  repeated in NIlakantha's Kriyasara (assuming that §AC predates Kriyasara), which  Ηόΐέηε Brunner translates and discusses in her article "De la consommation du  nirmalya de Siva," Journal asiatique 256 (1969): 213-63.  

13. Unnamed purana, cited in SAC p. 120.  

14. Readers versed in the Tamil Saiva bhakti tradition will recognize Canda also as  one of the sixty-three Saiva nayanmars, whose story of devotion to Siva is narrated  by Cekkilar in chapter 20 of the Periyapuranam. Eric af Edholm considers more  fully the relation of the Tamil nayanmarCanta. and the agama deity Canda in "Canda and  the Sacrificial Remnants: A Contribution to Indian Gastrotheology," Indologica  Taurinensia 12 (1984): 75-91.  

15. Nirmalamani points out that candapuja is obligatory for the siddhanta wor shiper, while it is prohibited to followers of other Saiva schools (KKDP p. 132).  The significant role of Canda and the notion that nirmalya is too pure for human con sumption appear to be ritual features distinctive to Saiva siddhanta.  16. SupA, quoted in SAC p. 113.

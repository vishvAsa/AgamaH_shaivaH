The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā of Kuladatta and its Parallels in the Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantras 

Ryugen Tanemura 

1 Introduction 

Most people think that the prominent features of Tantric religions are their esoteric teachings. This might mislead us into supposing that these religions were limited to restricted communities. But in fact these religions extended over a much wider domain.We see this if we consider the fact that both Śaivism and Tantric Buddhism offered a wide range of public social rituals.1 Following 

1 Sanderson proposes that what kept Śaivism alive, and enabled it to exert its influence, was ritual for others, as the professional activity of officiants who operated outside the narrow confines of self-cultivation (Sanderson 2010, 12). 

Generally speaking, rituals for others, i.e. rituals performed for the benefit of donors, were formed through modification of rituals for personal salvation. In the case of Tantric Buddhism, the pratiṣṭhā ritual is a modification of the utpattikrama practice. See the fol lowing three quotations: Ratnākaraśānti’s Bhramahara: tasyānandina āsyena dvihoḥkāravi darbhitam | jvalad bījadvayaṃ rāgāt padmāntaḥ praviśad dravet || tato vajrī mahārāgād vilīya saha vidyayā |śaraccandradravanibhāṃ tiṣṭhen maṇḍalatāṃ gataḥ || athotthānāya taṃ devyaḥ sthitvā koṇāsanenduṣu | codayeyuś catasṛbhiś catasro vajragītibhiḥ || (Isaacson 2002, 162, lines 9–15); Vajrāvalī (abhiṣeka section): tais tathāgataiḥ prajñāsamāpannair mahārā geṇa dravībhūya vairocanadvāreṇāntarniviśya vajramārgeṇa nirgatya taddravair devīpadme mukhena praveśitaṃ śiṣyaṃ jhaṭiti śūnyatānantaraṃ hūṃvajrajātasaprajñākṣobhyarūpiṇaṃ jñānasattvābhinnam abhiṣicya punar bhujamukhādimūrtibhiḥ *padmān (corr.; padmāt EM) niḥsṛtya gaganam āpūrya sthitair locanādividyāsahitaiś chatradhvajapatākāvastravāditragī tanṛtyapuṣpakuṅkumādivṛṣṭibhiḥ karakiśalayāvarjitabodhicittāmṛtapūrṇasitakalaśais taṃ śi ṣyaṃ *padmān (corr.; padmāt EM) niḥsṛtam abhiṣicyamānaṃ … (EM §24.2, vol. 2, p. 341, lines 6–11); Vajrāvalī (pratiṣṭhā section): taiś ca tathāgataiḥ prajñāsamāpannair mahārāgeṇa dravībhūya svasya vairocanadvāreṇa praviśya vajramārgeṇa nirgatya taddravair devīpadme mukhena praveśitaṃ pratimādikam abhiṣicya punar bhujamukhādimūrtibhiḥ *padmān (corr.; padmāt EM) niḥsṛtya bahir ambaram āpūrya sthitair locanādividyāsahitaiś cchatrapatākānṛ tyagītavāditrakusumakuṅkumādivṛṣṭiparikaritakarakiśalayāvarjitabodhicittāmṛtapūrṇasita kalaśais tat pratimādikaṃ padmād bahir niḥsṛtam abhiṣicyamānaṃ … (EM §17.3, vol. 2, p. 416, line 17–p. 417, line 2). The first passage quoted from the Bhramahara teaches how the practi tioner should generate himself as Hevajra in the First Union (ādiyoga). The practitioner, who has the form of the seed syllables, should enter the womb of Nairātmyā, Hevajra’s consort, through Hevajra’s mouth, become liquid (i.e. the state of śūnyatā), be emitted outside the

Śaiva models, Tantric Buddhism offered various kinds of consecration cere monies (pratiṣṭhā).2 Śaivism produced Paddhatis and Pratiṣṭhātantras3 which teach the details of these public social rituals. Tantric Buddhism also produced a number of manuals which are closely comparable to Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantras and Paddhatis. Of these, three manuals are particularly rich in information: the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā of Kuladatta, the Vajrāvalī of Abhayākaragupta, and the Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya of Jagaddarpaṇa or Darpaṇācārya, which incorporates much of the Vajrāvalī but adds some new materials (Sanderson 2009, 126–127, note 293). 

The purpose of this paper is to present a variety of Śaiva parallels in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, especially textual parallels between the Kriyāsaṃgra 

womb, and have the form of Hevajra. The second passage quoted from Vajrāvalī teaches how the master should visualise the initiand in the udakābhiṣeka. The master should visualise that the initiand is made to enter the womb of the goddess, becomes liquid (śūnyatā), and is emit ted outside the womb. This is a modification of the meditation in the utpattikrama practice. The third passage quoted from Vajrāvalī teaches how the officiant should visualise the deity of the image in the udakābhiṣeka of the pratiṣṭhā. The same method as the second passage is applied here. For the relationship between the utpattikrama practice and the pratiṣṭhā in Tantric Buddhism, see Tanemura 2004, 85–90. 

2 For the parallel repertoire of rituals between Śaivism and Tantric Buddhism, see Sanderson 2009, 124–127. To add some more information about the manuals of the Tantric Buddhist funeral rite (given on p. 126, note 294), after the publication of Sanderson 2009, I published a critical edition of and notes on Śūnyasamādhivajra’s Mṛtasugatiniyojana (Tanemura 2013a), an annotated Japanese translation of the same text (Tanemura 2013b), and a preliminary edition and annotated Japanese translation of the Antasthitikarmoddeśa of Padmaśrīmitra’s Maṇḍalopāyikā (Tanemura 2012). The visualisation taught in verses 12–13 of the Mṛtasuga tiniyojana is a modification of the mṛtasaṃjīvana practice elaborated in commentaries on the Guhyasamājatantra, which are classified as works of Jñānapāda school in the Tibetan canon. The utkrānti (intentional death of a yogin) is applied to the visualisations taught in verses 14–16. 

3 Sanderson proposes that the fundamental reason for Śaivism’s success was “that it greatly increased its appeal to royal patrons by extending and adapting its repertoire to contain a body of rituals and theory that legitimated, empowered, or promoted key elements of the social, political and economic process that characterizes the early medieval period (Sander son 2009, 253).” With regard to the second element, the proliferation of land-owing tem ples, “[t]he Śaivas of the Mantramārga provided specialized officiants and rituals to estab lish these Śivas [= Liṅgas], developing in the course of time a secondary body of scriptural authorities, the Pratiṣṭhātantras, devoted exclusively to this domain, setting out the rituals of installation (pratiṣṭhā) and defining the norms for the form of the Liṅga, the iconogra phy of ancillary images, and the architectural design of the various temple types” (Sanderson 2009, 274; the word in square brackets is supplied by the present author). The characteris tics of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā are very close to those of the Pratiṣṭhātantras mentioned above. With regard to the contents of the whole Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, see Tanemura 2004, 12–42.

hapañjikā and the Devyāmata, a Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantra, as materials to consider concerning the relations between Śaivism and Tantric Buddhism. 

2 Rituals in the Public Domain 

First, I would like to present parallels at the scriptural level between Śaivism and Tantric Buddhism. Just as in Śaivism, where the Saiddhāntika religion, which non-Saiddhāntikas considered to be a fundamental but exoteric and lower Śaiva teaching, is involved in the rituals in the public domain,4 so too the ritual system of the consecration ceremonies prescribed in the Kriyāsaṃgra hapañjikā is based on the Yogatantras (more precisely, the Vajradhātumaṇḍala system prescribed in the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha, the principal scrip ture of the Yogatantra class), which was considered to be the Vajrayāna’s fun damental authority by the “higher,” more esoteric tantras, i.e. Yogottara- and Yoginītantras.5 

4 For this non-Saiddhāntika view on the Saiddhāntika religion, see, e.g., Sanderson 2007, 231. On the public character of the Saiddhāntika religion, see, e.g., Sanderson 2007, 238–239 and Sanderson 2014, 13. 

5 For instance, the Sūtaka(-melāpaka) (commonly known as “Caryāmelāpakapradīpa,” which is not attested in Sanskrit primary sources) calls the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha the “root tantra.” See Sūtakamelāpaka (chapter 3 Vāgviveka): vajragurur āha—sādhu sādhu mahāsatt va śrītattvasaṃgrahādau mūlatantre cottaratantre ca vāyutattvaṃ na vispaṣṭenoktam, saṃ dhyāyabhāṣitatvāt (EW p. 375, lines 13–15); vajragurur āha—sādhu sādhu mahāsattva mantra tattvaṃ nāma tattvasaṃgrahādau mūlatantre cottaratantre ca kevalaṃ mantramātram udī ritaṃ mantroddhāro na pradarśitaḥ (EW p. 378, lines 13–15). That the system of the Yogatantra is the Vajrayāna’s fundamental authority might also be implied by the following verse of the Saṃvarodayatantra (21.2):sāmānyayogatantrānāṃrahasyaṃ na vipañcitam|siddhīnāṃ paramā siddhir vratnānāṃ paramaṃ vratam || (ET p. 134). 

That the system of the Vajradhātumaṇḍala taught in the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha is employed for rituals in the public domain is inferred from the fact that the fundamental system of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā is the Vajradhātumaṇḍala (See the citation from the Kalaśādhivāsanā section of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā below). 

The verses quoted below from Padmaśrīmitra’s Maṇḍalopāyikā suggest that the rituals prescribed in his manual, which are performed in public, are based on the Sarvatathā gatatattvasaṃgraha. See Padmaśrīmitra’s Maṇḍalopāyikā 2.39–41: ādāv arghavidhiḥ proktaḥ dvitīye bhūparigrahaḥ | tṛtīyaṃ *ṭippa(em.; tippa- Ms.)sūtraṃ tu jñānasūtraṃ caturthakam ||2.39|| pañcamo rajasāṃ pātaḥ ṣaṣṭhaṃ kalaśādhivāsanam | saptamaḥ kalaśanyāso maṇ ḍalasādhanam aṣṭamam ||2.40|| pratiṣṭhā navamī caiva daśamī homakriyā matā | ekādaśī visṛṣṭiḥ syād ity uktaṃ tattvasaṃgrahe ||2.41|| (2r7–8). The eleven rituals from the arghavidhi to the visṛṣṭi mentioned in the above-quoted verses are rituals related to the pratiṣṭhā (cf. the structure of the rituals prescribed in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, for which see Tanemura 2004, Introduction). The phrase “taught in the (Sarvatathāgata-)Tattvasaṃgraha” does not

The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā as a whole is a kind of construction manual for monasteries, and the author Kuladatta teaches details of various kinds of rituals within this framework.6 In chapter 2, having examined the site for a monastery and removed from the site extraneous substances that cause vari ous calamities, the officiant (ācārya) should visualise the site, which has been divided into eighty-one compartments, as the Vajradhātumaṇḍala. He should visualise Vairocana in the centre and the other deities in the rest of the com partments. In chapter 3, the officiant should prepare water jugs which are to be used in the ritual. These water jugs represent the deities of the Vajradhātumaṇ ḍala, and he should draw the symbols of the deities on them. In the pratiṣṭhā of images, although images (or rather the deities of images) go through the brah manical life cycle rites, they are sprinkled with water from the water jugs which represent the deities of the Vajradhātumaṇḍala. 

The fact that the system of the Vajradhātumaṇḍala is fundamental is implied by the following remarks of Kuladatta.7 

(1) Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, Kalaśādhivāsanā in chapter 3: 

yasyācāryasya vajradhātau nādhimokṣas tasya sveṣṭadevatādhimokṣeṇa bhūśodhanapratiṣṭhāparyanteṣu sarvakriyākaraṇam aviruddham.8 Tanemura 2004, 135 

necessarily mean that the scripture prescribes the eleven rituals listed in the verses, probably only that the mantra-visualisation system employed in those rituals is that of the Vajradhātu maṇḍala taught in the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha. (Cf. Kimiaki Tanaka’s understanding of the words from ādau to visṛṣṭiḥ syāt as being directly quoted by Padmaśrīmitra from the scripture; see Tanaka 2010, 562.) For instance, the samayawhich the officiant causes the deity of the images to listen to is “oṃ hūṃ trāḥ hrīḥ aḥ,” the syllables of the Five Buddhas of the Vajradhātumaṇḍala (9r9).

7 After the publication of Tanemura 2004, I was able to access the following two manuscripts of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā. N2: Kaiser Library Access No. 109; N3: NGMPP E365/12 (private collection). I report on the readings of these manuscripts when I quote the texts from Tane mura 2004. With regard to N2, the first forty-five leaves, of which the material is paper, are a later addition to the original palm-leaf manuscript. The leaves before folio 35 of the origi nal palm-leaf manuscript have been lost. The original manuscript was copied in samvat 336. According to Petech, the date of copying is verified for Thursday, February 11th, 1216 (Petech 1984, 81).With regard to N2,I report only on the readings of the original palm-leaf manuscript. 

8 Mss. N2 and N3 read as follows. N2: yasyācāryyasya vajradhātau nāmādhimokṣaḥ tasya sveṣ ṭadevatādhi*mokṣeṇa(N2pc; mokṣauṇa N2ac) bhūśodhanapratiṣṭhāparyyanteṣu sarvve kriyā karaṇam aviruddhaḥ || (30v1–2); N3: yasyācāryasya vajradhātau nādhimokṣaḥ tasya sveṣṭade vatādhimokṣeṇa bhūśodhanapratiṣṭhāparyanteṣu sarvvakriyākaraṇam aviruddhaṃ || (24v1– 2). 
 

the kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā of kuladatta 511 

If an ācārya does not have a strong conviction in the Vajradhātu, there is no obstacle to his doing all the rites from purification of the site to conse cration [of images etc.] with a strong conviction in his own chosen deity. 

The fact that the pratiṣṭhā prescribed in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā is a public social ritual is implied in some parts in the text. 

(2) Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, chapter 4: 

tato bhūpatiḥ sthapatikarmakaraprekṣakalokān yathārhaṃ kaṅkaṇāṅgu līyakavastrahiraṇyasrakpūgatāmbulādibhiḥ samyak paritoṣayet.9

Then the king should satisfy the architects, the assistants, and the specta tors with a bracelet, a finger-ring, a garment, gold, heap of chaplet, tām būla, or other [articles] according to [the donor’s] wealth. 

(3) Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, Pratiṣṭhā in chapter 6: 

prekṣakajanāṃś ca tāmbūlādibhiḥ saṃtoṣya śreyase bhojanaṃ baliś ca deyaḥ.10 

Tanemura 2004, 162 

[The ācārya should] also entertain spectators with tāmbūla etc. [In addi tion,] food and a bali should be offered for [their] good fortune. 

(4) Cf. Vajrāvalī (Vihāragandhakūṭīcaityāvasathāśramārghavidhi) pūgasrakcandanaiḥ prekṣakalokān sampūjya 

EM §1.1.6, vol. 1, p. 58; A 4r1; B 3v4 

In the above-quoted passages from the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, it is envisaged that the ritual is performed in the presence of spectators. The same character istic of the ritual is also found in the above-quoted passage of the Vajrāvalī. It is also envisaged from the first quotation that the sponsor of the ritual is a king. I shall come back to this point later. 

9 The edition is based on the following witnesses (for sigla, see the bibliography): N 37v6, N2 39v5, N3 44v1–2, C1 33r5, C2 51v5, C3 43r5, T1 43v4, T2 40v2–3, T3 37v5. 

10 Mss. N2 and N3 read as follows. N2: prekṣakajanāṃś ca tāṃvūlādibhiḥ saṃtoṣya śreyase bhojanam valiś ca deyaḥ (150v3); N3: prekṣakajanāś catāmvūlādibhiḥ santoṣya śreyase bho janaṃ valiś ca deyaḥ (174r3–4).

From the passage quoted below, we see that people are not only passive spec tators but also active performers of the ritual.

When the wood [to be used for the construction of a monastery] or the stones [to be used for the construction of a caitya] are brought into the city, [the ācārya] should send a message [that these materials are being brought into the city] to the king or the citizens. He should make peo ple with joyful minds whose bodies quiver with excitement carry [these materials]. 

3 Royal Patronage 

The above-quoted passage (5) too implies not only that the pratiṣṭhā prescribed is a public social ritual, but also that the king might be envisaged as a donor. Royal patronage of the ritual is also implied by the following passage in the nimittokti section of chapter 3: 

śiraḥkaṇḍūyamānaṃ yady ācāryaśilpiyajamānatanniyogijanānāṃ ma dhye kaścit karoti tadaikapauruṣād adhaḥ śalyam asti.12

etc.], then there is an extraneous thing [that causes a calamity at a depth of] the full height of a man underground. 

While an ordinary donor might be present on his own, the king would never be seen without his retinue of officials. 

As already mentioned in footnote 3 in this paper, Sanderson proposes that the fundamental reason for Śaivism’s success was “that it greatly increased its appeal to royal patrons by extending and adapting its repertoire to contain a body of rituals and theory that legitimated, empowered, or promoted key ele ments of the social, political and economic process that characterizes the early medieval period (Sanderson 2009, 253).”With regard to the second element, he states as follows: 

The second element of the early medieval process to which I have drawn attention is the proliferation of land-owning temples. All but the most ephemeral sovereigns during this period, both in the subcontinent and in Southeast Asia, gave material form to the legitimacy and solidity of their power by building grand temples in which images of their chosen God were installed, animated, named after themselves (svanāmnā), and endowed with land and officiants to support their cult. As we have seen, the great majority of these temples enshrined Śiva [in theform of a Liṅga]. Sanderson 2009, 274 

The first line after the opening verses of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā might reflect similar activities done by royal patrons for tantric Buddhism. 

Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, Ācāryaparīkṣā in chapter 1: 

tatra vihārādikam abhidhātukāmo yajamāna ādāv ācāryaṃ parīkṣayet.13

In this case (tatra), a donor who wants to name a monastery and other [thing for religious purpose after himself] should, first of all, choose an [appropriate] officiant.

514 tanemura 

The manuscripts are divided into two groups with regard to the reading of the third word. Mss. C1 C2 T3 read abhidhātukāmo, which is employed in the above quotation, and Mss. K T2 vidhātukāmo. (The reading of T1 is a corrup tion of vidhātukāmo, and that of C3 is a corruption of kartukāmo, which is a synonym of vidhātukāmo.14) I suspect that the author, Kuladatta, envisages a king as a donor of a monastery, which should be named after the king. The original reading of the third word is therefore abhidhātukāmo. The prescrip tions in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā are applied to other rituals related to the construction of a temple. In some cases, objects of pratiṣṭhā are not named after the donor. This might have changed the reading abhidhātukāmo to vi dhātukāmo. Alternatively, it might be the case that the custom that monas teries, caityas, and other religious objects are named after the donor had died out or was dying out in Kathmandu in Kuladatta’s time. Sanderson points out that the Licchavis of Nepal supported Buddhism (Sanderson 2009, 74–77). According to the Gopālarājavaṃśāvalī, the earliest local chronicle, the follow ing monasteries and caitya were named after the donor: the Mānavihāra by Mānadeva, the Dharmadevacaitya by Dharmadeva, and the Devalavihāra by Devaladeva (Sanderson 2009, 74). The first one is confirmed by its mention in an undated inscription assigned to his reign (Sanderson 2009, 75). Several of the monasteries of the Kathmadu valley are attributed to kings of the period of the Ṭhākurī kings—most probably Kuladatta flourished in this period—in inscriptions, palm-leaf deeds, manuscript colophons, or their own tradition. But no monastery orcaitya named after a king is reported (Sanderson 2009, 77– 80). I am not able to draw a firm conclusion, but there might be factors which changed the reading abhidhātukāmo to vidhātukāmo.15 

4 Textual Parallels 

Next, I would like to present textual parallels between the Kriyāsaṃgraha pañjikā and Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantras. The section which contains these Śaiva parallels is called the nimittokti. In chapter 3, the ācārya should divide the 

14 This kind of “unfaithful copy” is found in various places of Ms. C. See Tanemura 2004, 102. 15 I do not conclude that the prescriptions of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā are merely ideal. Rather, as I have already pointed out, the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā is practical in its char acter (Tanemura 2004, 104–111). For instance, the measurements of a monastery by calcu lation based on the prescriptions of the vāstunāga are very close to those of the plans of Cha Bahi and I Baha Bahi in the Kathmandu valley. See Tanemura 2002, 572, note 29. For the plans of Cha Bahi and I Baha Bahi, see the plates attached to Watanabe et al. 2009.

site into thirty-six compartments. He should drive ritual spikes (kīla) sym bolising the thirty-two wrathful deities into the compartments, excluding the four central ones, and worship the spikes. Then he should visualise himself as Vajrahūṃkāra in order to remove obstacles from the site. Then the ācārya should re-arrange the placement of the spikes in a proper way. After that, the ācārya should connect the pañcasūtras—the cords of Brahman, the root cords, the direction cords, and the side cords—to the spikes driven to the ground (sūtrapātana). The nimittokti explains various kinds of good and bad omens during the sūtrapātana. I have already shown parallels in the Piṅgalāmata, a Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantra, the Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati, and some other sources (Tanemura 2004, 148–155), and I have found yet other parallels in the Devyā mata, another Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantra. 

4.1 The Nimittokti of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā and the 

Śalyoddhārapaṭala of the Devyāmata 

First I shall quote the relevant part of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā (abbreviated as KSP) from Tanemura 2004, 148–155. The corresponding verse numbers of the Devyāmata (DM) are indicated at the end of each section. For the convenience of readers, the corresponding section number of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā are also indicated at the end of each section of the Devyāmata, both in the edition and in the translation.

Provisional translation 

Next, I shall, as told before, teach the characteristics of extraneous substances, which exist beneath the site (vāstumadhye) and cause calamities to people. (1) 

When the site, which has been made square, is being divided with cords, [the officiant] who has knowledge of divisions of the site (vāstudehavibhāga jñaḥ) should investigate extraneous substances by omens, etc. (2) When the division of [the sites for] a house and a shrine with cords has been commenced, the wise man [i.e. the officiant] should notice an omen and observe it correctly. (3) 

[The omens are] seeing [someone or something], announcing [a creature’s name], cries [of animals], and the actions of a donor. [The officiant] should carefully notice an extraneous substance as situated beneath the site. (4) 

If a heretic is seen, that brings an undesirable outcome to householders. If one hears someone hurt, wounded, or killed, or something broken, then [the offi ciant] should not divide the site with cords. (5) 

If there are persons who are not praised, undesirable, or blameworthy, then one should avoid seeing such persons, hearing [the names of] such persons announced, and hearing the voices of such persons. (6) 

If a cord is cut, there is death or deadly pain.32 (= KSP [1]) (7ab) 

[The officiant] who has knowledge of the ritual should perform the fire rite for quelling of calamities, if he becomes aware of such [omens]. (7cd) Since a levelled house brings every comfort and prosperity [to the residents], one should divide the site properly with cords and examine extraneous sub stances beneath the site (veśmani). (8) 

[The officiant] should carefully prognosticate the extraneous thing [under ground] by observing [a creature] step over a cord, seeing [an auspicious or inauspicious thing], announcing a [creature’s] name, or hearing [an aus picious or inauspicious sound]. If [a creature] steps over [a cord] or is seen, or if one [hears] a cry of [a creature] or announce a [creature’s] name, then [the officiant] should prognosticate the extraneous thing [related to] that creature according to the stepping over and other [omens]. (= KSP [0]) (9– 10) 

32 The second outcome, deadly pain, is not mentioned in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā. 
 

the kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā of kuladatta 525 

If a creature [intrudes into the site] stepping over [a cord], then [the officiant] should know that there is the body [of that creature, i.e. bones of that crea ture beneath the site]. He should prognosticate an extraneous substance beneath the site (vāstunaḥ) by the bad condition of the householder’s body. (11) 

If an omen is seen, or if [a creature] cries out, or if [someone] announces a [creature’s] name, then [the officiant] should prognosticate an extraneous thing [related to] that [creature]. (= KSP [5]) (12) 

… 

If a cat [intrudes into the site] stepping over [a cord] while a cord is being cast, it should be understood that there is the bone of an ass beneath that spot of the site.33 (= KSP [3](1)) (18) 

If a dog steps over a cord, [the officiant] should prognosticate the bone of a dog [beneath] the [spot of the site]. (= KSP [3](3)) (19ab) 

If a mouse passes [over a cord], [the officiant] should prognosticate bones of goats and sheep [beneath the site].34 (= KSP [3](13)) (19cd) 

If rams or sheep [step over a cord], there is the bone of a cow [beneath the site].35 (= KSP [3](4)) (20a) 

If cows [step over a cord], [the officiant] should prognosticate bones of a horse [beneath the site]. (20b) 

If a horse steps over [a cord], [the officiant] should prognosticate an extraneous thing related to a buffalo[, i.e. the bone of a buffalo beneath the ground].36 (= KSP [3](5)) (20cd) 

If a buffalo steps over [a cord], there is the bone of a jackal [beneath the site]. (= KSP [3](8)) (21ab) 

If a jackal steps over [a cord], [the officiant] should prognosticate the bone of a boar [beneath the site]. (21cd) 

If a hog steps over [a cord], there is [the bone of] a tiger [beneath the site]. (= KSP [3](11)) (22a) 

33 Although the Devyāmata does not mention the bone of a cat as an extraneous thing, it should also be prognosticated if we consider v. 10 of the Devyāmata above. 

34 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā mentions the bone of a mouse, which is not mentioned in the Devyāmata, as the extraneous thing in the case that a mouse passes over a cord. If we con sider v. 10 of the Devyāmata above, the bone of mouse should also be prognosticated in this case. 

35 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā mentions bones of rams and sheep, which are not mentioned in the Devyāmata as extraneous things. Probably, in this case too, the rule of v. 10 above should be applied. 

36 If the rule of v. 10 is applied, the bone of a horse should also be prognosticated in this case. The bone of a buffalo is not mentioned in the corresponding part of the Kriyāsaṃgraha pañjikā. 
 

526 tanemura 

If a tiger [steps over a cord], there is [the bone of] an elephant [beneath the site]. (= KSP [3](12)) (22b) 

If an elephant steps over [a cord], [there is the bone of] a camel [beneath the site].37 (= KSP [3](6)) (22c) 

If an camel steps over [a cord], there is †aṅgārasa† [beneath the site]. (22d) If a man steps over [a cord], there is a human bone [beneath the site]. (23a) If an ass [intrudes into the site] stepping over [a cord], there is the bone of an ass [beneath the site]. (= KSP [3](2)) (23b) 

In this way, [the officiant] should examine extraneous substances by [the omens] such as stepping over and seeing. (23cd) 

… 

If a cow [which has entered the site] urinates or drops dung, there are pieces of silver or gold [beneath the site, respectively].38 (= KSP [6](1)) (32ab) If a cat urinates or drops dung, [the officiant] should prognosticate a piece of iron or an inauspicious thing (? aśam)39 [beneath the site,] respectively. (32cd) 

… 

If a bird sings sweetly in an auspicious direction, then [the officiant] should prognosticate a treasure there. (v. 34abc = KSP [5](4)) (34a–c) 

… 

If [someone] scratches his head, [the officiant] should remove an extraneous thing at a depth of the full height of a man (śirasi). On the other hand, it should be understood that the extraneous thing which is a bone exists [at a depth of] a half [of the height] of a man [underground].40 (= KSP [4](1)) (63c–64b) 

If [someone] touches his mouth (or face), there must be [an extraneous thing] which is a piece of wood or hair (? śirobhavaḥ) [at a depth of] two cubits underground.41 (= KSP [4](4)) (64c–65b) 

If [someone] touches his teeth, there is [an extraneous thing] which is a tooth (hanujam). [The officiant] should remove [it from a depth of] that measure ment [= up to the teeth].42 (= KSP [4](5)) (65cd) 

37 The Devyāmata does not mention the bone of an elephant, which is mentioned in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā. Probably, in this case too, the rule of v. 10 should be applied. 38 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā does not mention the former omen, i.e. the urination of a cow. 39 There might be a corruption here. It is expected that the extraneous thing is a certain kind of metal in this case. 

40 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā teaches only that there is an extraneous thing at a depth of the full height of a man in this case. 

41 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā teaches that the depth is three cubits in this case. 42 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā teaches that the depth is three cubits in this case. 
 

If [someone] touches a part of his body, [the officiant] should prognosticate an extraneous thing (arthaṃ … śalyam) [at a depth] up to the part. (66ab) If [someone] touches his neck, they know that there is [an extraneous thing] which is an iron chain. It should be understood that that iron chain [exists at a depth of] three cubits [underground]. There is no doubt about it.43 (= KSP [4](7)) (66c–67b) 

If [someone] scratches a part of his body, [the officiant] should prognosticate an extraneous thing related to the part (aṅgajam) at a depth up to the part (adhastāt tatpramāṇe). [The officiant] should remove the extraneous thing carefully. (67c–68b) 

If [someone] scratches his shoulder (?), [the officiant] should prognosticate an extraneous thing related to the shoulder (?), which is at a depth up to the [shoulder (?)]. If he knows it correctly, he should remove it.44 (68c–69b) 

If someone scratches his arm, there is armlet [at the depth] up to the arm.45 [That extraneous thing] exists [at a depth of] three and a half cubits [under ground].46 There is no doubt about it. (= KSP [4](10)) (69c–70b) 

If [someone] touches his [left?] hand, [the officiant] should prognosticate the leg of a couch [beneath the site]. If [someone] touches his finger (karajāṅ guli°), [the officiant] should know [that the extraneous thing] is situated at a depth up to the knee.47 (= KSP [4](12)) (70c–71b) 

Alternatively, if [someone] scratches his [right?] hand, it is understood that there is an extraneous thing, i.e. a skull or [a bowl] made of clay [at a depth] just up to the buttocks [underground]. The wise man [i.e. officiant] should remove it.48 (= KSP [4](11)) (71c–72b) 

If [someone] scratches his breast, there is the bone of an animal (paśuśalyam) or hair (aṅgajam)49 [at a depth of] one and a half cubits underground.50 

43 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā additionally mentions a necklace and skeleton of a cat as extraneous things in the case that someone touches his neck. 

44 I am not sure whatsphaṇa orsphaṇaka means. The preceding verse refers to the neck and the following the arm, so this word probably means shoulder. 

45 If we refer to the parallel in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, the extraneous thing to be prog nosticated is an ornament related to the arm. 

46 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā teaches that the depth is the measurement up to the neck. 47 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā limits the first condition to the left hand, but does not men tion the second condition, i.e. touching a finger. 

48 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā limits the condition to the right hand. The relevant part of the Devyāmata does not have a word corresponding to †pṛṣṭḥakapālam† in the Kriyāsaṃ grahapañjikā, i.e. the Devyāmata does not give a clue to solve the textual problem in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā. 

49 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā does not mention this second extraneous thing. 50 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā teaches that the depth is the measurement up to the buttocks in this case. 
 

528 tanemura 

[The officiant] should remove that extraneous thing carefully. (= KSP [4](14)) (72c–73b) 

If [someone] touches his heart, there is [an extraneous thing] related to it (tat mayam) at a depth up to the heart (hṛdaye … pramāṇena). (73cd) If [someone] touches his back, there is [an extraneous thing] arising from the back[, i.e. a back-bone at the depth up to the back]. If [someone touches] his belly, [there is an extraneous thing related to the belly] at the depth up to the [belly]. (= KSP [4](15)) (74ab) 

If [someone] touches his side, one should prognosticate that there is an extra neous thing arising from dust. The best knower of extraneous things [= the officiant] should remove that extraneous thing which exists [at a depth of] that measurement [= up to the side] [underground]. (= KSP [4](13)) (74c– 75b) 

If [someone] touches his buttocks, there is [an extraneous thing] arising from the buttocks[, i.e. coccyx?] or an iron nail at a depth of two cubits [under ground]. [The officiant] should remove that extraneous thing from there. (= KSP [4](16)) (75c–76b) 

If [someone] scratches his thigh, there is an extraneous thing related to the thigh or piece of wood at a depth of one and a half cubits. [The officiant] should remove it carefully. (76c–77b) 

If [someone] is seen to scratch his knee, there is an extraneous thing, i.e. a stump (sthāṇujam) or a knee bone ( jānujam) at a depth of one cubit. [The officiant] should remove it.51 (77c–78b) 

If [someone] touches his shank, [the officiant] should prognosticate a bone of the shank [at a depth of] eleven digits underground in that place. There is no doubt about this. (= KSP [4](18)) (78c–79b) 

If [someone] scratches his foot, [the officiant] should prognosticate an extrane ous thing related to an elephant[, i.e. a born of an elephant (kauñjaraṃ)].52 He should remove the extraneous thing, i.e. a thorn [at a depth of] twelve digits [underground]. (= KSP [4](20)) (79c–80b) 

If [someone] scratches his big toe, [the officiant] should prognosticate an extra neous thing, i.e. a piece of chalk. Alternatively, he should prognosticate a piece of iron mixed with various calxes of brass there. (80c–81b) 

51 I have not translated the corruption, nādhitopaskarasvāpi. 

52 An extraneous thing prescribed in the corresponding part of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā is a piece of silk-cotton wood (śālmalī). 
 

the kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā of kuladatta 529 

If [someone] scratches his toe, [the officiant] should prognosticate a foot of a horse [beneath the site].53 It exists at a depth of one and a half vitastis. There is no doubt regarding this. (81c–82b) 

If [someone] scratches his little toe, [the officiant] should prognosticate a piece of bell-metal [beneath] the spot. That [extraneous thing] exists [at a depth of] eight digits [underground]. There is no doubt about it. (= KSP [4](21)) (82c–83b) 

If [someone] scratches his sole, [the officiant] should prognosticate an animal’s hide as the extraneous thing. There is the extraneous thing at a depth of eight digits. (83c–84b) 

… 

These are the rules for the removal of extraneous substances. 

5 Concluding Remarks 

Whereas Śaivism produced Pratiṣṭhātantras, scriptures which specialise in temple construction and installation, Buddhism did not produce a scripture in this domain.54 The author of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā was aware that there is no scriptural authority at least with regard to the nimittokti section. Thus he states that one should consider various omens based on the half stanza from Dīpaṅkarabhadra’s Guhyasamājamaṇḍalavidhi. He also employs the word liṅga as a synonym of nimitta and uses this word not only for an aus picious or inauspicious sign or omen, but also as a term from logic (inferential sign). His intention is probably to state that the word nimitta in the half stanza quoted from the Guhyasamājamaṇḍalavidhi should be understood as a liṅga and, therefore, things caused by those liṅgas are correctly inferred (anumīyate) based on the liṅgaliṅgisaṃbandha. However, this might not necessarily mean that Kuladatta thinks his teachings are non-Buddhist. For in ritual manuals 

53 A foot of a horse (aśvapādaṃ) is supported by Ms. B and Ms. A reads aṣṭapādaṃ (a spi der). Since the omen is scratching the toe, an extraneous thing related to the foot might be better. 

54 The Śaivas of Mantramārga produced a secondary body of scriptural authorities, the Pratiṣṭhātantras, devoted exclusively to the domain of construction of royal temples. They also asserted the principle that the Śaiva sthāpaka, the specialist who performs the rit uals related to temple construction and installation, is competent not only for the Śaiva domain but also for all the levels that Śaivas ranked below this (Sanderson 2009, 274–275). Cf. Devyāmata: pāṣaṇḍidarśanaṃ neṣṭaṅ gṛhiṇām asukhāvahaṃ (Ms. A 91v1); Kriyāsaṃ grahapañjikā, nimittokti: vidvadbrāhmaṇabhikṣusādhujanānāṃ saṃdarśane dharmaḥ syāt (Tanemura 2004, 155). 
 

530 tanemura 

it is important that Buddhist mantra-visualisation systems are employed.55 In the case of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, the mantra-visualisation systems of the Yogatantra and the “higher” tantras are employed, and in this sense the rituals prescribed function as Buddhist. This syncretism of different classes of scrip tures is common to both Śaivism and Tantric Buddhism. 

The nimittokti and other sections (e.g. bhūmiparīkṣā) in which close tex tual parallels to Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantras and Paddhatis are found have little to do with Śaiva and Buddhist doctrines and those sections have close parallels to jyotiḥśāstras and śilpaśāstras.56 One might suppose that this is evidence of the fact that both Śaivism and Buddhism used this kind of literature as common sources and established their own respective ritual systems. This is probably not the case. Although the non-sectarian parallels are common to the Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantras or Paddhatis and the Buddhist ritual manuals, and these two religions employ different mantra-visualisation systems, the struc tures or styles of the rituals prescribed are similar to each other. For example, while the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā teaches that in the preparation of water jugs the officiant should make the assistants recite Mahāyāna sūtras, the Somaśam bhupaddhati prescribes a preparation ritual for consecration of the Śivaliṅga in which mantras of the four Vedas are recited in the four directions (Tanemura 2004, 235, note 50). Considering the parallels on the scriptural level mentioned above, the parallel repertoire of rituals prescribed in Śaiva ritual texts and the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, and the similarities of structures or styles of the rituals, it is not implausible that one religion, probably Buddhism, followed examples of the other. It is, of course, important to consider various parallels of the kinds presented in this paper in greater detail in order to understand the relationship between Śaivism and Tantric Buddhism. 

55 The sūtrapātanavidhi, in which the nimittokti section is included, is based on the mantra visualisation system of the Vajradhātumaṇḍala taught in the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃ graha. See Tanemura 2004, 139–155, 237–250. 

56 For example, descriptions similar to those of the nimittokti of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā are found in the Bṛhatsaṃihtā 53.105–110 (EB vol. 1, pp. 489–491). See also Tanemura 2004, 245–250.

Appendix: A Provisional Edition and Translation of the 

Bhūśalyasūtrapātananimittavidhi of the Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya 

After I had finished writing a draft of this article, I found a small section of Jagaddarpaṇa’s Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya which teaches about extraneous things beneath the site for a maṇḍala or monastery, and the omens for those extrane ous things. Here I present a preliminary edition and provisional translation of the relevant section. This is written in verse, and the metre is śārdūlavikrīḍitā. Most probably the material is silently quoted from the work of a predeces sor; the section colophon of Ms. K states that the Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya is a compilation of various teachings (for this colophon, see the apparatus of this preliminary edition).

The excellent master [= officiant] in steady meditation, gazing upon the centre of the tip of his nose, should cast the cord on the surface of the site which has been levelled following the rules exactly. [The cord,] into which [the five threads of the five colours] are twined, has as its nature the five wisdoms and is purified. [It] does not have a knot, and is placed in the centre [of the site before casting]. (1a–c) 

Having praised [the cord] with the sounds of a bell, auspicious song, conch shell, and bamboo flute, the donor should offer guest water [to the cord] together with jewels, gold, and fragrant flowers, which are blooming and beautiful, and mixed with the juice extracted from the sprouts of the aira ndhrīkara. (1d–2b) 

[The officiant] should examine omens. If a cord is cut, the death of a master [will take place]. (= KSP [1]) If the cries of a jackal, a vulture and a heron [are heard], then the death of a lord [will] definitely [take place]. (= KSP [2]) (2cd) 

If a cord is stepped over by a specific kind of creature, then there must be a bone of that creature beneath the site (vāstuni) on which the cord is being cast (sūtrādhāre). (= KSP [3]) (3ab) 

If [some other man] who stands beside the donor announces a [creature’s] name while a cord is being cast, then there is an impure substance, i.e. a bone of the creature of the name beneath the site on which the donor is standing. (= KSP [5]) (3cd) 

If [someone] touches [a particular part of] his body and [the site] is quickly dug to a depth up to that [particular part of the body] according to the rules, then there is the [extraneous thing corresponding to the omen]. (= KSP [4]) (4a) 

[With regard to bodily sensations,] various omens of extraneous things [be neath the site] are taught. In this [short section], however, [the explanation is] just abridged. (4b) 

If a cow comes and drops dung, then there is the same amount of gold as the [dung beneath the site]. (= KSP [6](1)) Alternatively, if a young girl [comes and] urinates, then there must be the same amount of silver as [the urine beneath the site]. (= KSP [6](2)) (4cd)

the kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā of kuladatta 535 

If a frog croaks, there is danger of water in the [donor’s?] house. (= KSP [6](3)) If smoke [is seen], there is distraction of mind. (= KSP [6](7)) If a person suffering from a disease (rogārtāṅga°), a person of a lower [class], a person suffering from leprosy, a deranged person (°vivaśa°), and a woman are seen, then it causes disease (rogabhāk). (= KSP [6](8)) (5ab) 

Songs (kaṇṭharutam) of a jīvaṃjīvaka bird, peacock, kokila bird, parrot, ca krāṅka, haṃsa, and a bull bring auspiciousness. If [these creatures] are seen, it brings prosperity. (= KSP [6](4)) (5cd) 

The roar of a lion, the sound of thunder, and the roar of a royal elephant bring the gain of grain and property. (= KSP [6](5)) (6a) 

If the voices of children playing, the sound of a conch-shell, or an auspicious [song are heard], it brings wealth to the [donor’s] house. (= KSP [6](6)) (6b) If a parasol, lotus, banner, muraja drum, flagpole, ornament, a woman of the court, fish, milk, the best curd, wine, blazing fire, and fruits [are seen], then there are victory, extraordinary increase of grain, property, [the number of] sons, and other [merits], and the completion of duties. (= KSP [6](9)) (6c– 7a) 

If a bhikṣu, brāhmaṇa, wise man (°dhī°), or a wealthy man (°dhanottamajana-) is seen, it brings virtue. (= KSP [6](10)) (7b) 

In the consecration of [images of] deities and other [sacred objects], [the offi ciant] should examine the [above-mentioned] omens which bring merits [to the donor] in the commencement of the rite of the casting of cords, and then perform [the casting of cords]. (7cd) 

The officiant with special knowledge of architecture57 who is skilled in the examination [of omens] should abandon inauspicious[, extraneous] things by all means. By doing this ( yena), fortune and auspiciousness will certainly be brought to the donor, the king, and all people who live in the region. [Therefore, the officiant] should first examine the [omens], and then under take the rite [to follow] when the combination of fixed stars and planets, and the day are auspicious. (8) 

These are the rules for extraneous things beneath the site and the omens [observed] in the rite of casting of cords. 

57 I have not seen the word śilpācārya elsewhere. If this is not a corruption, it probably refers to a particular class of officiant which is equivalent to the sthāpaka, the Śaiva officiant who specialises in the installation of images and consecration of temples.

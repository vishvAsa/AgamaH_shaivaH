title = "14 Śārikā’s Mantra"

+++

Jürgen Hanneder 

The goddess Śārikā belongs to a group of Kashmirian lineage deities (kuladevī or vaṃśadevī) who, like Bālā, Rājñī, and Jvālā, are identified with particular locations.1 Śārikā resides on the Pradyumna peak in Śrīnagar, also known as the “Śārikā peak,” and is worshipped there in the form of a large stone around which a temple has been constructed.If one wishes to identify the cult practiced there and locate it within the religious landscape of the valley, a visitor might start with the modern inscription shown in figure 14.1, which reads as follows: 

bindutrikoṇavasukoṇadaśārayugma 

manvaśranāgadalasaṃyutaṣoḍaśāram | 

vṛttatrayaṃ ca dharaṇīsadanatrayaṃ ca 

śrīcakrarājam uditaṃ paradevatāyāḥ || 

This verse describes the śrīcakra, the yantra of the “supreme deity” (parade vatā) commonly known as Tripurā, by merely listing in the first three pādas the geometrical elements of the yantra, for instance bindu (“dot”) and trikoṇa (“tri angle”). It is quoted often, with variations,2 and attributed to several scriptural sources in Tantric literature. 

What we are to understand here, one must suppose, is that in modern times Śārikā was understood or presented as a form of Tripurā, or as belonging to her cultic context. 

Unfortunately fieldwork of this kind does not disclose the history of the cult. We know that the first scriptures of the cult of Tripurā were written not before the eleventh century;3 needless to say, they make no mention of Śārikā. On the other hand, the local Kashmirian cult of Śārikā is at least as old as the Kathā saritsāgara (second half of the twelfth century),4 and it is rather doubtful that the two goddesses’ association is this old. 

1 See Sanderson 2009, 111. 

2 For instance, Lakṣmīdhara in his commentary on the Saundaryalaharī reads the third pāda as vṛttatribhūpurayutaṃ paritaś caturdvāḥ and in the fourth śrīcakram etad […]. 3 Sanderson 2015, 32. 

4 See 12.6.111: yena pradyumnaśikharaṃ śārikākūṭam ity api […], and 12.6.116: tatra snātvā vita stāyām arcayitvā vināyakam saṃpūjya śārikāṃ devīṃ digbandhādipuraḥsaram.

For finding out more about the cult of Śārikā, including her ritual and pos sibly doctrinal details, we have a single published source, the Devīrahasya,5 which contains passages on the cult of the Kashmirian lineage deities. In par ticular, the ritual texts appended to the edition of the Devīrahasya give the mantroddhāra, sahasranāma and other typical elements of the worship of these deities.In this text Śārikā is clearly identified as having the form of a stone (śilārūpā)6 on the Pradyumna hill. Her worship is said to remove the impurity (mala) stemming from such capital offences as the murder of a Brahmin or drinking alcohol, or eating what is forbidden.7 The details of the mantra are given, as are the Ṛṣi, etc., a dhyānaśloka, her yantra, and how to employ the mantra for the magic acts of immobilizing (stambhana) and so forth.8 This is followed by a Śārikāpūjāpaddhati (pp. 412–419).

Further sources are difficult to trace or remain unpublished. First is a so called Śārikāstrotra attributed to the Pradyumnāvatāra. This text is “a mālā mantra in prose with a dhyānaśloka in the beginning and two verses at the end.”9 Apart from its manuscript in the Bodleian, there are two more in the Lindenmuseum (Stuttgart),10 and one in Śrīnagar.11 Judging from the excerpts given in the Verzeichnis der orientalischen Handschriften in Deutschland (VOHD) catalogue, there are variations such as insertions of new names and additional phrases that cannot be reduced easily to a single critical text.12 In any case, for our purposes a transcript of the Śrīnagar manuscript (S) is suffi cient:

The Agnikāryapaddhati also transmits this verse.

iti śrīśārikāstotram 

From this stotra we can gather something about the iconography of the deity, for instance the attributes held in her eighteen arms,20 her names, the seven goddesses (amā etc.) that form her retinue and their symbolism. 

The main information on a deity for ritual purposes is of course her mantra. Here one unpublished source21 gives the mantra in a Vedic style by stating its Ṛṣi, metre, and deity, but augmented with the tantric elements bīja, śakti and kīlaka,22 and there is of course also a tantric Gāyatrī devoted to Śārikā.23 

So it seems the cult of Śārikā is fairly old, but it has been influenced by the cult of Tripurā or Śrīvidyā. One such influence must have been the Kashmirian Kauls, a clan that migrated to Kashmir not before the fifteenth century24 and brought their own cults with them, which were then fused with the local Kash mirian cults.25 The most important figure in this group, Sāhib Kaul, is credited with three ritual handbooks andfurthermorefused Advaita Vedāntic ideaswith the Kashmirian Pratyabhijñā.26 Sāhib Kaul has also composed a further text on the deity, a Śārikāstotra27 in eighteen verses which, as he says, gives the deriva tion of her Mantra.28

With true devotion I worship that divine and omnipresent Śārikā, who bears the crescent moon on her head, who grants liberation, destroys delusion everywhere, destroys the bad fear of meeting a wrong death. 

Since we have to suppose a Kashmirian pronounciation, which does not prop erly distinguish aspirated from non-aspirated stops, all four lines are real ized as an end rhyme. In this verse the goddess is adored as granting liber ation, removing29 confusion etc. One iconographical detail known from the other sources, that she bears the crescent moon on her head, is alluded to as well. 

After the introductory stanza the main topic of the stotra, the mantroddhāra explicitly mentioned in v. 17, commences: 

tāraṃ bījaṃ yo japed amba bhaktyā

2b ābdhes] L1; ābdhaṃ O3 

O mother Śārikā, whoever devotedly recites your tāra-syllable, which car ries one across (tāraka) the ocean of transmigration, may, when his wis dom is ripened through the knowledge of the absolute, even put to shame the Lord of the Word (bṛhaspati). 

“Your bīja” means the (first) syllable of the mantra of Śārikā. Sāhib Kaul uses code words for the syllables that make up the mantra, a common practice 

29 In verse 1a the root dāṇ dāne(Dhātupāṭha 1.977) is used, while in 1b and 1c the root is dāp lavane(Dhātupāṭha 2.50).

which enables a writer to—as it were—speak of a mantra without actually pro nouncing it. Thus, to those uninitiated and ignorant of the codes, the true form of the mantra must have, at least in theory, remained unknown. 

tāra is a common code word for the syllable oṃ and poses no problems. The codes that follow are partly difficult to interpret and will be discussed below.

He who remembers your next syllable, which is īśa with abja, vahni, and padma, is remembered by goddesses in heaven, Nāga maidens in the netherworld, and women on earth confused by the arrows of Kāma.

One of pure mind who recites with complete devotion the lakṣmī-syllable, which is difficult for bad people to obtain, him the goddess of good for tune will always be eager to see, and although unsteady (by nature) she will remain at his doorstep out of devotion.

He who recites your next syllable, which is īśa with abja and the one above the left ear, his enemy, although invincible even for all the gods, will instantly, in the wink of an eye, become a guest in the house of Death.

He who remembers your next syllable, which is īśa together with vak travṛtta and vahni, will have at his disposal “enjoyment”30 (bhukti), lib eration, the method of real vicāra,31 and devotion.

He who recites your syllable with pure heart and proper devotion, O Śārikā, which consists of abja and vaktravṛtta, in his mouth a fully devel oped32 voice stays, which has the beauty of unfolding through various good emotions. 

sābjaṃ bījaṃ vaktravṛttena yuktaṃ

jīvanmuktaś ceha bhuktvātibhogāl

8c bhuktvā] L1 O3; bhuktā B1 

He who recites your syllable, consisting of abja and vaktravṛtta, and called asthyātmā, O Śārikā, is liberated in life and, enjoying supreme bhogas,33 will later dissolve in your state, O Bhavānī. 

30 In context, this may mean the enjoyment of powers (siddhi). 

31 I understand the term in the sense of ātmavicāra as used in the Mokṣopāya (5.5.27), a text which Sāhib Kaul occasionally refers to. 

32 prauḍham is of course an adverb, but to translate “stays ripely” would not really capture the intended sense. 

33 This could again denote the siddhis, but in a less technical register the enjoyment of the pleasures of liberation.

I praise you; it is you in whom I take refuge. I serve the Goddess alone, the one power of all (powers). I utter my noisy stammering to you; I contem plate (you) who are everything, suitable for all (sārva), and everywhere.

Having attained the strength of true intelligence through Jñānasvāmin, I know what there is to know and everywhere contemplate my own self. I, Sāhib Kaula, have composed this hymn to the lineage deity Śārikā, which contains the construction of her Mantra. 

Sāhib Kaul’s Śārikāstava deals with some aspects of the worship of this deity; most importantly, as the author states in verse 17, it gives the mantroddhāra of the Śārikāmantra. The author’s teacher Jñānasvāmin, according to Madhusu dan Kaul,34 was his maternal uncle.

śārikā’s mantra 359 

This final stanza explains the idea behind this work. A person who is not ini tiated into the recitation of the mantra of Śārikā and may not even know how to decode the mantroddhāra can still benefit from this type of substitute recita tion. In this the work is similar in approach to the Sūryastutirahasya of Sāhib Kaul’s contemporary Ratnakaṇṭha, where the Vedic Gāyatrī-mantra is hidden within a hymn addressed to the sun as an acrostichon.35 

The aim in both cases is apparently to enable persons who lack proper adhikāra—for Vedic mantras, in the case of Ratnakaṇṭha, or Tantric mantras, in the case of Sāhib Kaul—to gain at least some kind of access to these restricted parts of the religion. This technique of “hiding” the actual form of the mantras in a stotra meant for religious recitation is not so much a way to conceal it from the outsider, but a method to enable him or her to use it without breaking reli gious rules, in other words a method to bypass religious and social restrictions. Theologically the matter is of course complicated, because Ratnakaṇṭha’s sto tra actually contains the sounds that make up the Gāyatrī, so in a sense by reciting the stotra one does recite the Gāyatrī. In the case of the Śārikāstava, since only code names are given, one does not utter the sounds that make up the mantra of Śārikā. 

Despite the fact that the stotra contains the mantroddhāra, it is quite diffi cult to decipher the mantra from Sāhib Kaul’s stotra alone, for the system of codes is not otherwise known. The most obvious place to search for a solution would be the mantroddhāra in the Devīrahasya, for this text deals in detail with the Kashmirian lineage goddesses, and according to Aithal,36 the Śrīvidyānitya pūjāpaddhati of Sāhib Kaul as available in the ms. Chandra Shum Shere c. 264 is roughly identical with the ritual manuals printed in the appendix to the Devī rahasya.37 This is the relevant verse:38 

tāraṃ parā-mā-taṭa-sindhurārṇāḥ 

khaṃ śarma tanmadhyagataṃ ca nāma | 

ante ’śmarī pārvati śārikāyās 

trayodaśārṇo manur asti gopyaḥ ||

36 Aithal, 1999, 35. 

37 Judging from the excerpts a similar ms. is described in Catalogue of the Sanskrit Manu scripts in the Library of the India Office. Part IV. A.VIII Tantra. See Windisch, 1894, 861– 862.

The code words—parā for hrīṃ, aśmarī for namaḥ etc.—are explained in the edition of the Devīrahasya.39 Furthermore, in its second chapter the mantras are given also in plain language (spaṣṭam), as is the mantra of Śārikā: oṃ hrīṃ śrīṃ hūṃ phrāṃ āṃ śāṃ śārikāyai namaḥ.40 We might thus conclude that all is well, and that since the wording of the mantra itself is not (and, the ologically speaking, should not) be in doubt, we have a good chance to under stand Sāhib Kaul’s mantroddhāra. Since these sets of codes cannot easily be corrupted in the course of transmission, no banal error should have crept in.41 

However, if we look at the definitions in Sāhib Kaul’s Śārikāstava, we find that not all can be brought into accord with this form of the mantra. Table 14.1 shows the expected bījas and their definitions in the verses. We may leave out verses 2, 4 and 9, because they do not use complicated codes: tāra usually means “oṃ,” lakṣmī stands for “śrī,” and the conclusion of the mantra (dative of the deity and namaḥ) is as expected. 

The problem arises when we try to decode the remainder as follows: (1) the element present in all definitions is abja and there is only one sound common to all five bījas, that is, ṃ. Apart from that nos. 6–8 have only one element in common, so vaktravṛtta standsfor ā. Taking now elements that occur only once, it follows that in 8 asthy- must signify ś, vāmakarṇa- in 5 means ū, and vahni

41 There is, of course, the counter-evidence of one manuscript of a Śārikāstavarāja (VOHD 2.2.116), which gives the mantra with the misspelling or wrong transcription of hrūṃ for hūṃ. 
 

śārikā’s mantra 361 

as expected stands for r. Now only īśa remains, which stands for h in 3 and 5, but—in view of our mantra—should stand for ph in 6. 

Let us now look at another source. The mantra is also given in the Dakṣiṇa mūrtyuddhārakośa, where we find the following definition:42 

tāraṃ māyāṃ śriyaṃ kūrcaṃ sindhuraṃ śūnyam eva ca | 

kalyāṇaṃ śārikādevyā bījaṁ saptākṣaraṃ smṛtam || 

According to the index of code words in the appendix and the “prakāśam” ver sion (ibid., 16) this translates into the seven bījas “oṃ hrīṃ śrīṃ hūṃ hrāṃ āṃ śāṃ.” The manuscripts reported have three other options for hrāṃ, one being phrāṃ, our reading from the Devīrahasya. 

Now, in the index of the edition of the Dakṣiṇamūrtyuddhārakośa the code word sindhura is given as hrāṃ,while according to the bījākṣarapāribhāṣikasūcī contained in the Devīrahasya (p. 21) it means phrāṃ.In other words we find two versions of the mantra in the available sources, unless the editors have misread their manuscripts. What we can say is that the evidence from Sāhib Kaul con firms the version of the Dakṣiṇamūrtyuddhārakośa.

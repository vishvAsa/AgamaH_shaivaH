Diwakar Acharya 

This essay concerns a pūjāstuti1 that guides its reciter through the mental or actual worship of the goddess Nityā. The text is composed in the first person but the author does not name himself in the text. The text is named Vāmakeśvarī stuti and attributed to Mahārājādhirāja Vidyādharacakravartin Vatsarāja in the colophon of the sole palm-leaf manuscript of the text available to me. How ever, the last verse of the text calls it Kāmeśvarīstuti and describes it using two adjectives, kāmasiddhi and atimaṅgalakāmadhenu. It is not unnatural, I think, to name this stuti using its first adjective.2 

The manuscript containing this stuti text is preserved in the National Ar chives, Kathmandu. It bears accession number 1–1077 and can be found micro filmed under NGMPP reel number A 39/15. The same manuscript also contains a paddhati text called Aśeṣakulavallarī that dwells on the worship of the god dess Tripurā, but this text remains incomplete as the folios following the six teenth are absent. Our text begins on the verso of the first folio and ends in the third line of the recto of the fourth, with a colophon and a decorative sym bol. The other text immediately follows in the same hand with a salutation to the goddess Tripurā. The manuscript is written in a variety of North Indian script close to Newari with frequent use of pṛṣṭhamātrās. It is possible that this manuscript was copied by an immigrant or pilgrim in Kathmandu valley. It measures 33×4.5cm and has a binding hole to the left of the centre. It bears foliation in numerals in the left margin and in numbers in the right margin of verso folios. The text in the manuscript is dotted with scribal errors, but no secunda manus corrections are seen. On palaeographical grounds I place the manuscript in the late fourteenth century. 

This manuscript contains 46 verses of the stuti and one more verse (num bered here as 38a) can be retrieved from a citation.3 A little less than the half of the stuti covering the first 21 verses is in Anuṣṭubh metre and the rest in 

1 A number of pūjāstutis of the Tripurā traditon can be found in the appendix section of Dwivedi 1985. Aghoraśiva’s Pañcāvaraṇastava, published from Pondicherry (see Goodall et al. 2005), is a good example of a Siddhānta Śaiva pūjāstuti.

Vasantatilakā. Verses 31 and 32 form a yugalaka as the finite verb comes only in the second verse. The author plays now and again with syllabic rhyming (anuprāsa), and his language is beautiful, though sometimes elliptical. 

The stuti opens with a pair of verses invoking Paramaśiva and Nityā Śakti. These verses already tell us of the poet’s understanding of the nature of Nityā and inseparability of Paramaśiva and Śakti, a point highlighted in the second half of the text, particularly verses 31–32 and 42. In verse 3 the poet states that he approaches the temple of Mṛḍānī from the west gate (paścimadvāra).4 The next two verses invoke Gaṇeśa and Kṣetreśa. The latter, who has the form of Bhairava, can be identified as Baṭuka. Gaṇeśa and Baṭuka together are iden tified as the goddess’s sons in Śākta systems and serve as her doorkeepers.5 To our surprise, verse 6 invokes the Vaiṣṇava doorkeepers Śaṅkhanidhi and Padmanidhi, who bear the Vaiṣṇava emblems of the conch and lotus on their heads.6 Verses 7–9 invoke respectively three goddesses: Padmā, a Vaiṣṇava ver sion of Durgā carrying a conch and discus, and Bhāratī. Verses 10 and 11 invoke Manobhava, namely, the Indian love-god Kāmadeva, and describe him as the 

4 This should be the intended meaning, because one is supposed to enter a temple from the western or southern gate facing east or north. Therefore, many of the early Śaiva-Śākta tem ples, even though they face east, have an older western or southern entry. For more discus sions, see Goodall et al. 2005, 103–107 and Goodall et al. 2015, 366 (Niśvāsa, Uttarasūtra 3:8 and annotation thereon). Another possible interpretation of paścimadvāra is “the last door to resort to.” Perhaps, the poet is punning. 

5 For Gaṇeśa and Baṭuka as the Goddess’ sons, See, e.g., Jayaratha on Tantrāloka 1.6b. 6 Śaṃkhanidhi and Padmanidhi have strong associations with the cult of Yakṣas. In the Megha dūta, Kālidāsa’s Yakṣa tells the cloud-messenger that the marks of conch (śaṃkha) and lotus (padma) are painted on the sides of the gate of his house in the city of Alakā, as he pro vides a number of clues for the identification of his house. In the form of emblems as well as human forms, Śaṃkhanidhi and Padmanidhi are depicted in the Ajaṇṭā caves and are asso ciated with Yakṣa deities (cf. Bautze-Picron 2002, 225–231). Besides, the Buddhist Vasudhārā Dhāraṇī enjoins worship Śaṅkhanidhāna and Padmanidhāna with the goddess Vasudhārā encircled by a group of eight unspecified Yakṣiṇīs. Some other texts name Śaṃkhanidhi and Padmanidhi as male consorts of Vasudhārā and Vasumatī, respectively. Anyway, these two are adopted by the Vaiṣṇavas as doorkeepers or attendants of Viṣṇu along with the other pairs of Jaya and Vijaya, Caṇḍa and Pracaṇḍa, Nanda and Sunanda. They also feature in some compar atively late Tantric texts of other traditions, particularly those from the south. They are listed also among the twelve Vaiṣṇava nidhis found in some Puranic and Vaiṣṇava texts. Professor Dominic Goodall kindly informs me (personal communication of November 20, 2019) that what is now called the Kailāsanātha temple in Kancheepuram seems to have Śaṅkhanidhi and Padmanidhi framing the doorway. According to him, that temple now has an eastern entrance to the enclosure, but there is an older western entry, now blocked up. 

For an example of images of Śaṃkhanidhi and Padmanidhi from Anurādhapur, Sri Lanka, See Paranavitana 1955.

beloved husband of Rati and Prīti.7 Here we are told that the love-god forms the circular base of the Śrīcakra, the maṇḍala of the goddess Nityā Sundarī. With these verses the text enters the process of installation of various deities in the Śrīcakra. It does not specify where these deities are installed, but from the order of verses we know that we are starting from the periphery and mov ing towards the centre. Verses 12–14 respectively praise eightsiddhis, beginning with Aṇimā (in personified forms), eight mother-goddesses, and the deities of ten gestures of the goddess.8 Verses 15 and 16 venerate sixteen goddesses of attraction (ākarṣaṇa) and eight powers of the bodiless love-god (anaṅgaśakti), respectively, all in personified forms.9 We know from the Vāmakeśvaratantra and other Tripurā texts that these are installed on the petals of the sixteen- and eight-petalled lotuses. The next four verses, 17–20, respectively praise the set of fourteen goddesses/powers (śaktis) headed by Sarvasaṃkṣobhaṇī,10 ten Kula 

7 For Rati and Prīti as Kāmadeva’s wives, see, e.g. Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa III.44.33. A Śuṅga period teracotta plaque of Kāmadeva with Rati and Prīti is also preserved in the Mathura Musuem (accession no. 34–2552). 

8 It is possible that these three sets of deities are installed on the three lines forming the out ermost retinue of the rectangular boundary. The Vāmakeśvaratantra, also known as Nityā ṣoḍaśikārṇava, enjoins installing the eight mother-goddesses as well as the eight siddhis in the four directions and four sub-directions, and does not instruct one to worship the goddesses of the gestures. Bhāskararāya (p. 99), however, mentions that according to some other system the outermost boundary is made of three lines and these three sets of god desses are installed there. According to its commentators, the Vāmakeśvaratantra teaches that one should build the boundary with only two lines. Although the Vāmakeśvaratantra does not assign a place for the gestures (mudrā) in the maṇḍala, it does describe them and asks the worshipper to use them during the worship. As found in the third chapter of the Vāmakeśvaratantra, these ten gestures are trikhaṇḍā, kṣobhiṇī, vidrāviṇī, ākarṣiṇī, āveśakarī, unmādinī, mahāṅkuśā, khecarī, bīja, and yoni. 

As listed in many texts, including the Niśvāsaguhya (7.204–205), the eight siddhis are aṇimā, laghimā, mahimā, īśitva, vaśitva, prāpti, prākāmya, and yatrakāmāvasāyitā. The Vāmakeśvaratantra (1.153–155) makes them ten by adding two more, bhukti and icchā, and prescribes worshipping them in ten directions. According to the latter (1.156–157), the eight mother-goddesses are Brahmāṇī, Māheśī, Kaumārī, Vaiṣṇavī, Vārāhī, Indrāṇī, Cāmuṇḍā, and Mahālakṣmī. 

9 These are not individually named in this text, but, as listed in the Vāmakeśvaratantra, the first set is made of Kāmākarṣiṇī, Budhyākarṣiṇī, Ahaṃkārākarṣiṇī, Śabdākarṣiṇī, Sparśā karṣiṇī, Rūpākarṣiṇī, Rasākarṣiṇī, Gandhākarṣiṇī, Cittākarṣiṇī, Dhairyākarṣiṇī, Smṛtyā karṣiṇī, Nāmākarṣiṇī, Bījākarṣiṇī, Ātmākarṣiṇī, Amṛtākarṣiṇī, and Śarīrākarṣiṇī (cf. 1.158– 161), and the second set is made of Anaṅgakusumā, Anaṅgamekhalā, Anaṅgamadanā, Madanāturā, Anaṅgarekhā, Anaṅgaveginī, Anaṅgāṅkuśā, and Anaṅgamālinī (cf. 1.163– 164). 

10 We know only the name of the first from this text but the rest can be known from the Vāmakeśvaratantra (1.165–168). They are: Sarvavidrāviṇī, Sarvākarṣiṇī, Sarvāhlādinī, Sarvasaṃmohinī, Sarvastambhanī, Sarvajambhanī, Sarvatovaśinī, Sarvarañjanī, Sarvon 
 

goddesses (kuleśvarī) headed by Sarvasiddhipradā,11 ten goddesses headed by Sarvajñā,12 and eight goddesses of speech, headed by Vaśinī.13 They are sta tioned in the four consecutive retinues of fourteen, ten, another ten, and eight triangles. All deities in a group (see verses 12–20) are visualised in the same way; for example, all mother-goddesses (mātṛ) have the same appearance.14 Verse 21 invokes and asks the deities of four weapons of the goddess for their permission. It is known from other sources that they are placed around the central triangle (cf., e.g., Vāmakeśvaratantra 1.179–180). The next three verses, 22–24, praise Kāmeśvarī, Vajreśvarī, and Bhagamālinī, and urge them to fulfill the reciter’s desires. Unlike previous ones, these verses also name the three cor ners of the central triangle as the homes of these goddesses. Verse 25 is in praise of Nityā Sundarī, the goddess in the centre. From here onward, until the second to last verse (45), the poet praises Nityā in various ways. He first invokes the god dess as Nityā (verse 25) and later as Śrīsundarī (verse 30), and describes her as “the felicitous banner of the Love-god.” Verses 25–28 describe the beauty of the goddess, and verses 29–45, with the exception of verse 33 (which describes the Śrīcakra made of 43 triangles as her abode), exalt her in various ways, identi fying her as the ultimate reality of the external as well as internal worlds. She is described as the primordial light (ādyamahas) and paramārthavidyā, which can be interpreted as the highest mantra, the mantra leading to the highest, or the ultimate gnosis. The last verse is a fine eulogy of the stuti itself, describing its reward and thus encouraging people to recite it. 

It has been already pointed out by Sanderson and also Golovkova that the mature cult of Tripurasundarī developed against the backdrop of the nityā cult, evidence for which is available in the Nityākaulatantra and the Siddhakhaṇḍa of the Manthānabhairavatantra. In those texts Tripurasundarī is accompa 

mādinī, Sarvārthasādhanī, Sarvasampattipūraṇī, Sarvamantramayī, and Sarvadvandva kṣayaṃkarī. 

11 Again, the list can be completed with the help of the Vāmakeśvaratantra, but these god desses are here simply called śaktis. The other nine following Sarvasiddhipradā are: Sar vasampatpradā, Sarvapriyaṃkarī, Sarvamaṅgalakāriṇī, Sarvakāmapradā, Sarvaduḥkha vimocinī, Sarvamṛtyupraśamanī, Sarvavighnanivāriṇī, Sarvāṅgasundarī, and Sarvasau bhāgyadāyinī (cf. 1.169–171). 

12 Sarvajñā is followed by Sarvaśakti, Sarvaiśvaryapradāyinī, Sarvajñānamayī, Sarvavyādhi vināśinī, Sarvādhārasvarūpā, Sarvapāpaharā, Sarvānandamayī, Sarvarakṣāsvarūpiṇī, and Sarvepsitaphalapradā (cf. Vāmakeśvaratantra 1.173–175). 

13 The names of these eight can be retrieved from the mantroddhāra section of the Vāma keśvaratantra (cf. 1.77–80). They are Vaśinī, Kāmeśvarī, Modinī, Vimalā, Aruṇā, Jayinī, Sarveśvarī, and Kaulinī. 

14 Neither the Vāmakeśvaratantra nor any of the paddhatis of that tradition give visualisa tions of these deities.

nied by a retinue of eleven and nine nityās, respectively, and worshipped with Kāmadeva.15 Our text identifies Kāmadeva as the husband of Rati and Prīti, places him on the base of the Śrīcakra (cf. verses 10–11), and installs Nityā Sun darī at the altar of worship in the centre of the maṇḍala without a consort, inde pendent and supreme. However, in verses 31–32 she is described as devamahiṣī, although it is said that their body is one and undifferentiated.In verse 2 the poet names the goddess Nityā and invokes her as the Śakti of Paramaśiva possessing all powers and carrying out the five tasks (pañcakṛtya) for him. In verse 34 the poet invokes her as Maheśvarī but states that some royal people in this world call her Lakṣmī and Parā Prakṛti. In verse 40 she is described as Atibhavā, high lighting her transcendent nature, and in verse 42 she is invoked again as Gaurī. It is thus clear that the poet of our text is a Śaiva devotee of goddess Nityā. It is important to note that in the system known to our poet there is only one Nityā, simply called Sundarī, and that the Śrīcakra is also already known. Our poet appears unaware of the sixteen nityās, who are worshipped in the tradi tion of the Vāmakeśvaratantra. It thus appears that the tradition this stuti text represents is different from both the cult of nityās and that of Tripurā. 

The inclusion of Śaṅkhanidhi and Padmanidhi (verse 6), Padmā (verse 7), and the Vaiṣṇava Durgā (verse 8) suggests that the goddess Nityā is somehow linked to the Vaiṣṇava tradition as well. In fact, in verse 34 the poet mentions that some people call her Lakṣmī and Parā Prakṛti, but we are not aware of sur vival of any Vaiṣṇava paddhati of Nityā. 

Now I come to the issue of the poet’s identity. The fact that he is a king and was perhaps somewhat distressed at the time of composition of the stuti can be known from the text itself (cf. verse 40). Furthermore, in the colophon the text is attributed to Mahārājādhirāja Vidyādharacakravarti Vatsarāja.16 Appar ently, the first epithet is royal—he is the king of great kings—while the second is mantric: he is sovereign among the vidyādharas, who are supposed to pos sess esoteric mantric knowledge and due to this have supernatural powers. Vatsarāja is his personal name. The most famous Vatsarāja, the mythical king of Ujjayinī, does not fit the context. Another is King Vatsarāja of the Gurjara Pratihāra dynasty (c. 775–805ce), the father of Mahārājādhirāja Nāgabhaṭa II (805–833ce). Vatsarāja is always called paramamāheśvara, but in the Pra tāpagaḍh Stone Inscription of Mahendrapāla II (dated Year 1003 = 946ce), 

15 cf. Sanderson 2009, 47–49; Golovkova 2012, 816–817. 

16 It is interesting to note that a fifteenth-century inscription from Vijayanagara remembers a king called Vatsarāja blessed by Tripurāmbā. As Sinopoli (2010, 22) cites, “ ‘As Vani blesses king Bhoka, Tripuramba king Vatsaraja, and Kali king Vikramarka, so does Pampa now bless Devaraya’ (trans. Rajasekhara 1992: 27).” 
 

the kāmasiddhistuti of king vatsarāja 369 

Nāgabhaṭa II is called paramabhagavatībhakta.17 It may be a coincidence, but the latter’s mother is named Sundarī. In any case, this Vatsarāja could be our poet.18 Our text represents an archaic tradition that does not even know the name Tripurasundarī, and thus this date in the early-ninth century ce fits it well.

I revere the Nityā Śakti of the Lord, i.e. Paramaśiva. She possesses all pow ers and carries out the five tasks [for him].21 She bestows grace upon all, is eternal, and is the motherly origin of all good. 

17 cf. Sircar 1983, 251. 

18 There is another poet of the same name who flourished in the second half of the twelfth and the first quarter of the thirteenth century ce (cf. Dalal 1918, vi–vii), but he is a minister, not a king. He served the Kālañjara King Paramardideva and wrote some dramatic pieces. Six of such pieces have been published in one volume under the title Rūpakaṣaṭkam (see Dalal 1918). He does not mention Nityā, Sundarī, or Tripurasundarī in his dramas. 

19 The manuscript begins with an invocation, ||oṃ namo gaṇapataye||, preceded by a siddhi sign. I do not think that this invocation is part of the text. 

20 The manuscript reads niḥśāmānanda- and I have emended it to niḥsīmānanda. I have found this compound used at least in one more text, the Adhikaraṇasārāvalī of Vedān tadeśika. 

21 The five tasks of Śiva include punishment (nigraha) and grace (anugraha), besides cre ation, maintenance, and destruction.

23 Finding the manuscript reading pāṇipādan tu nanditam problematic, I have conjectured pāṇipadmaṃ tu maṇḍitam. 

24 This description reveals that Kṣetreśa has the form of Bhairava. I assume that he is Baṭuka bhairava on the basis of his Bhairava-like appearance and companionship with Gaṇeśa.

You are the bride of the god [i.e., Śiva], and possess a body inseparable [from his]. You bestow worldly enjoyment and also liberation from [the world]. You are the stream [of consciousness or immortality] (dhārā),27 O ruler of worlds. Dwelling originally in the abode of Śiva, you multiply yourself sixfold and prepare the path of existence where you nurture wonderful and manifold creation with your own six forms. You shed moonlight on the path of Suṣumṇā that is charming due to the beautiful appearance of the six lotuses serving as [your] bases.

O goddess, though you are one and simple,28 you are [also] nine,29 you are ten, you are again ten, and again you are fourteen. Thus you, the benefac tor of poets, dwell in the sea of Śaktis marked with forty-three triangles. 

27 These two verses depict the goddess as the stream of consciousness or immortality in the human body, known widely as Kuṇḍalinī, originating from the brahmarandhra, the abode of Śiva, flowing through various channels and reaching to the six bases. It is in this light that these verses should be read. 

28 I have conjectured api in place of asi to provide a concessive tone. Perhaps this is not even necessary. In any case, on her own the goddess is singular and unembellished, but the poet appears to imply that all goddesses in different retinues of the Śrīcakra are her projections. 

29 The central triangle and the immediately following retinue of eight triangles are obviously counted together as nine.

However, according to a verse attributed to the Skandapurāṇa and cited in the Bhagavatsandarbha of Jīva Gosvāmin, Śrī is Parā Prakṛti, the consciousness associated with Viṣṇu (śrīḥ parā prakṛtiḥ proktā cetanā viṣṇusaṃśrayā |; Bhagavatsandarbha, p. 278). It is possible that our

poet is telling us about two different identifications: Nityā as Lakṣmī, the consort of Viṣṇu, and Nityā as Parā Prakṛti Vāsudeva, the supreme cause of both sentient and insentient beings. 

31 The underlying digit of the moon (antaścarī śaśikalā) in all likelihood is the sixteen inner most digit beyond the waning and waxing process. 

32 The late Pundit Vraja Vallabha Dwivedi (1985, 45) presents this verse in his preface (origi nally written in 1968) to the Nityāṣoḍaśikārṇava as cited in the Aruṇāmodinī commentary of the Saundaryalaharī and attributed to the Kāmasiddhistotra of Vatsarāja (cf. Śāstrī 1957, 221), and suggests that it should be located in the Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript of the text (the same manuscript I am editing now). However, in 1983 in the Luptāga masaṃgraha, a collection of citations from lost Āgamic texts he prepared, he writes that the verse is not found in the palm-leaf manuscript and so must come from a different text (cf. Dwivedi 1983, 25). I think Dwivedi arrived at this conclusion without reading the implied name of the stuti. The author of the Aruṇāmodinī writes that it is a verse from the Kāmasiddhistotra of Vatsarāja, and the same name is alluded to in the last verse of our text. I conclude that the verse therefore belongs to this text even though it is not found in the palm-leaf manuscript. I assume that it was dropped in the process of transmission. It is thus just possible that there are still a few more verses missing from the latter part of the stuti.

37 Thus, there are three deities in this tradition who can be called by this name: the chief goddess Nityā, one of the goddesses in the central triangle, and one of the goddesses of speech in the retinue of eight triangles.

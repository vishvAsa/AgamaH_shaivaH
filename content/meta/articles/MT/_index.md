> As per the shaiva tradition of the brahma-yAmala that expounds the lore
  of kAplIsha bhairava and raktachAmuNDA, the sixth srotas is that of the
  nR^isiMha tantra-s. Another tradition like that recorded by
  abhinavagupta and jayaratha state this srotas was that of hATakeshvara.
  Tradition holds that the homology of hATakeshvara with nR^isiMha was
  expounded by the now lost AnandAdhikAra tantra. Further evidence for
  this is suggested by the eka-pa\~nchAshan-nR^isiMha-nAmAni of the kAlI
  kula.

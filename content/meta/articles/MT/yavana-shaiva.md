We are well aware of the yavana vaiShNava from the Heliodorus inscription. But where there yavana shaiva? The case of lakulIsha points to this being the case. This unusual 1 foot head of rudra from Mathura might be take as evidence. It is unlike any other depiction of rudra from Mathura or elsewhere from 200BCE-200 ACE. If it represented a stand form as in some of the early images it must have been upto 6 feet. We posit that it was made by a yavana shaiva following the conventions of his own iconography.

This may be seen in light of the inscription found on this silver-gold bowl from gandhAra published by Falk with a yavana's inscription: kaliphONena meridarkhena praTishunita nirakaTe boasa “By KalliphOn, the MeridarchEs, after a promise, (this) was repaid for Boa.” Boa=bhava

## मन्त्रमार्गः
### सैद्धान्तिका। ऊर्ध्वस्रोतः। 
- वर्षाश्रमधर्मसमर्थकाः। 

### भैरवाः। दक्षिणस्रोतः।
- अभिवगुप्तः प्रसिद्धः।
- The bhairavasrotas, though doctrinally very deviant from varṇadharma, has in practice, been varṇa-concordant.
- One recalls the renowned AG of the bhairavasrotas defending against the attacks on use of surā in kriyā by citing the sautrāmaṇi.

### अन्ये
- वामाः। ऊर्ध्वस्रोतः।
- गारुडाः। पूर्वस्रोतः।
- भूतमार्गः। पश्चिमस्रोतः।

## अतिमार्गाः
- लोकम् अतिक्रामयतीत्य् अतिमार्गः।  The atimArga traditions happened to be largely ascetic-centered. Did not care much for bhukti.

### पाशुपताः
- पाशुपतव्रतम् अतिमार्गेषु प्राचीनम्।

#### लाकुलीशाः / कालामुखाः।

Kālāmukhas produced exemplary dvijottamas (See Lorenzen & Śrī MT’s brief writings on this) who were erudite in veda & mīmām̐sā.

#### पाञ्चार्थिकाः
- Excentric practices: Acting as an aggressive lunatic so that bad karma is transferred to the one who reviles him. This is found in TB 2.3.9.9

### कापालिकाः।
- वर्णाश्रमोल्लङ्घिनो बभूवुः।
- "Milder versions of Kāpālikamārga may have existed. As Lorenzen & others have put it, even Kāpālika/Somasiddhānta was V1-dominated & milder strands may not have gone beyond contemplative practices in a śmaśāna, which would have a vaidika prototype in Prātṛda-Bhalla of JB."


## व्यभिचारः
- केचन शैवसाधनमार्गा (अतिमार्गे, मन्त्रमार्गेऽपि) व्यभिचारप्रेरका आसन्। 

### विरोधः
- Saiddhāntika texts like Prāyaścittasamuccaya has Śuddhis for even seeing a Kāpālika.
- Ācāryas also speak of how anyone doing kriyās filled with him̐sa & maithuna will attain paiśāca-pada.

### Caricatures
- Would a smArta or siddhAntin consider it ok to actually (not just symbolically) use cemetery ash for vibhUti? No.
- Do shaivas run counter to victorious varNAshrama dharma of Arya-s? Only some. Others strongly defend it.

## तिरुमुरै
- pAshupata atimArgists contributed to part of tirumurai, as did saiddhAntikas. There are also non-saiddhāntika mantramārga influences (heterodox from vaidika perspective) in the tirumuRai such as the tirumantiram. Ārumukha Nāvalar notes that 1st 8 TirumuRais alone are Siddhānta-concordant.

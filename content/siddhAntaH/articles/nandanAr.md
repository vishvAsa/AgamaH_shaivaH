So what exactly is the Nandanar story. Unfortunately the Nandhanar Charititam written by Gopalakrishna Bharatiyar went too far from the original history as mentioned in Sekkizhar’s Periya Puranam, which is the authentic source as far as the 63 Saiva Saints are concerned. Why did Gopalakrishna deviate so much and added so much of ‘masala’ is anybody’s guess. What is more appalling is that the legendary SS Vasan made a movie straight out of this story line & popularised. Thus this one stayed as if it was the correct version.

The actual life history of Nandhanar goes like this.Periya puranam says Nandhanar was born in pulaiyar caste His profession was making announcements playing the drum (Parai).This was as per govt grants

ஊரில் விடும் பறைத்துடவை உணவு உரிமையாக் கொண்டு  
சார்பில்வரும் தொழில் செய்வார்

From birth, he was a staunch Siva Bhaktha. He made musical instruments like Beri, Veena. He donated them to Siva temples nearby.

வீணைக்கும் யாழுக்கும் நிலை வகையில்  
சேர் உற்ற தந்திரியும் தேவர் பிரான் அர்ச்சனை கட்கு  
ஆர்வத்தின் உடன் கோரோசனையும் இவை அளித்து உள்ளார்

He also went to various temples for Darshan. Once he went to Thirupunganur temple.When he was praying from outside, the Nandhi before Siva hindered his view. Lord asked it to move aside

புன்கூர்க் கண் நுதலார் திருமுன்பு போர் ஏற்றை விலங்க அருள் புரிந்து அருளிப் புலப்படுத்தார்

Nandhanar was quite happy with this and he dug a pond near the temple.

His major goal was to go to Chidambaram but kept postponing it as he was concerned about his caste. He gathered some courage & went to Thillai. There he saw many mutts and yagasalas outside the town. So he just went round & slept outside the town. Lord Siva appeared in his & Thillai AnDanars (Brahmins in charge of temple) dreams. Informed them to create a fire pit & told that Nandhanar will walk over the fire so that he don’t have to feel about his caste. Thillai Andhanars were not keen to do this but agreed as the lord himself ordered it

தம்பெருமான் பணி கேட்ட தவ மறையோர் எல்லாரும்  
அம்பலவர் திருவாயின் முன்பு அச்சமுடன் ஈண்டி   
எம்பெருமான் அருள் செய்த பணி செய்வோம் என்று ஏத்த

They made a fire pit & Nandhanar walked straight through it. He entered the temple & disappeared once he entered the sanctum.

The key message to note is that no one stopped him entering the temples. It was his own thinking which made him hesitant. Lord Siva ensured that he came out of this mindblock by making him walk through fire.

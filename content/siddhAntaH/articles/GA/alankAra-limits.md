It's something I have been wondering myself since there is no proper codified text as far as alaMkAra is concerned. As far as temples in TN are concerned, the Agama-s give very brief instructions and do not delve into details. For instance, one encyclopedia I have quotes the particular ratio in which flowers, cloth and jewels must cover the vigraha of deity. There are some basic guidelines that I have encountered. For instance, the kAmikAgama (attached photos of text with translation).

Now, in the case of viSNu or devI, alaMkAra plays a more significant role since, unlike shiva who is worshiped mainly as a liNGa, their vigraha-s are anthropomorphic, giving more opportunities for a creative mind. In any case, one ought to note that creativity has its bounds. 

Now, in some Agama temples in TN, some have made it very popular to do drawings of faces on the liNGa. Now, this may seem very appealing to the public or even the eyes of the learned who know better. Some go one step further, attaching artificial faces to the liNGa! Now, as per the principles of siddhAnta Agama-s, that is very wrong. liNGa represents form-formless aspect of shiva. Drawing faces on it is unacceptable in the siddhAnta & severely undermines significance of the doctrinal aspect. Every physical detail has a philosophical subtext.

I'm not criticizing this practice as done in some other temples. (ujjain, etc). If they don't follow the siddhAnta (as is the case for most shiva temples outside the south), that's fine. Attaching artificial heads, arms, legs to the mUla mUrti (in sanctum) or utsava mUrti, or covering the idol so excessively with garlands/jewels or rupee notes that there is no pUjAbhAga (worshipable part) unconcealed for proper arcana by the arcakas; these are all unhealthy practices which often go forgiven in the name of "alaMkAra".

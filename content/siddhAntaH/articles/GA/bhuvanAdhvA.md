There are 6 parallel paths which map all of material existence (i.e. Evolutes of Śuddhamāyā (Bindu) & Aśuddhamāyā). These 6 can be divided into 2 broad categories.

Vācya (Objects/Artha):

1. Kalā
2. Tattva
3. Bhuvana

Vācaka (Word/Śabda):

4. Varṇa
5. Mantra
6. Pada

In Śaiva Metaphysics, 227 Bhuvanas in Bhuvanādhvan are mapped to the 5 Kalās, 36 Tattvas, 50 Varṇas, 11 Mantras and 81 words of the Vyomavyāpī.

During Dīkṣā, the body of the Dīkṣita becomes a ritual site for all of these six paths to be mapped via a thread (sūtra), with the Dīkṣita’s potential births in the Bhuvanas being realized then & there through mantra so that he wouldn’t have to undergo actual births there. This is during standard nirvāṇadīkṣā. We have other Dīkṣās where Dīkṣita desires to take births in certain transcendental Bhuvanas & attain Sārūpya or Sāyujya with a chosen deity & remain in that state for Kalpas before getting initiated into highest state from that Bhuvana.

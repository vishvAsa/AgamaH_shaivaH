- In the Śaiva context, your Dharma is Śivatvam (Śiva-Ness). To be omniscient, omnipresent & omnipotent is your true nature & therefore your Dharma. Again, Dharma here is not something you do but something you are.
- Karmas get done through the bodies, instruments, world & objects (tanu-karaṇa-bhuvana-bhoga) supplied by Māyā. The fruits of Karma are also consumed by means of tanu-karaṇetyādi.
- As Karman is gradually burnt off by experience (whether happiness or suffering), your Karman attains pakvam (maturation) & that *individual Śakti of mala* acting on *your* particular soul, in conjunction with *your* Karman, will also get pakvatvam.
- When that individual power of mala, that is acting on *your* particular soul, has reached its maximum potential, it starts to ripen & gradually slows down in its functioning & approaches a halt. This is when Śaktipāta (Descent of Śiva’s power) starts taking place.
- In the Siddhānta understanding, Śiva’s anugraha is eternally present for all existent s, BOTH sentient & insentient. All this while, mala & karma have been jumping the queue & getting the anugraha ahead of you. But this is not a bad thing.
  - What is the definition of anugraha in Siddhānta? It is causing a Dharmī to manifest its Dharma, causing an existent to manifest its innate nature, whether sentient or insentient.
- When the insentients, Mala & Karman, beat the soul on the queue & get Śivānugraha, they work robustly at performing their functions which are respectively, to obscure your powers & make you go through experiences. This may sound bad. But it isn’t.
  - Why? Remember that as with all insentient things, there is a limited “lifespan” for their operation before it starts decaying. And that’s what the expedited operation of Mala & Karman does. They get worn out , making way for your soul to receive “unfiltered anugraha.”
- That direct reception of Śivaśakti is what we call anugraha (grace). When that happens, you start thinking about Śiva & start longing for an Ācārya to get the Śaiva initiation.

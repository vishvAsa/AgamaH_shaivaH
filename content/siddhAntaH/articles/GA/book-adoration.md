Regarding the worship of a book by the उष्णीषधारी-s, even this meme, as most would know, has roots in हिंदु-धर्म. Nothing original. We see an example of that from the उत्तरभागा of the कामिकागम, going back to at least 500 years prior to the birth of the शिक्षपान्थी-s’ founder.

There will be a centre for studies (विद्यापीठ) in any of the temple’s 4 cardinal & 4 intermediate directions of the temple, or its inner circuit or, best, in the comforting presence of images of शिवभक्त-s. What materials to use for the book or for the pen? All detailed here. Sacred शैव scriptural wisdom should never be written down by the uninitiated (पशुः, पशवः) or studied in their presence by the wise. 

One going to write should worship शिव & शक्ति with incenses, show his appreciation to his गुरु & venerate the leaves he is about to write on. The leaves are becoming conduits for transmission of precious knowledge. So, they too must be venerated (पत्रिकामपि पूजयेत्). Our धर्म breeds a culture of reverence, something those who are content with being cheap imitations of monotheists will never understand.

Textual criticism, or attempting to uncover the “most correct reading” to put it in lay terms, is no modern discipline. The expert writer assessed various copies (some of which were made by incompetent आचार्य-s), fix spelling, metrical & doctrinal errors & reconstruct the text. 

शिवज्ञानस्य कालेन प्रणष्टस्य प्रमादतः॥  
ऊनातिरिक्त-वर्णस्य लिखितस्य प्रमादिभिः।  
प्रमादीकृत पाठस्य नाशितस्याल्पबुद्धिभिः॥  
अल्पज्ञानसमोपेतैर् आचार्यैश् शोधितस्य च।  
व्यर्थैः पदैरुपेतस्य पुनरुक्तस्य चार्थतः॥  
पूर्वोत्तरविरुद्धस्य स्वसिद्धान्त-विरोधिनः।  
छन्दसातीव नष्टस्य शब्दार्थ-रहितस्य च॥  
इत्येवमादिभिर् दोषैर् उपेतस्य क्वचित् क्वचित्।  
यः करोति पुमान् सम्यक् संस्कारं देशिकः सुधीः॥ १७  
शिवतत्त्वार्थ विद्वान् यः स विद्याः पारमेश्वराः।  
अध्यापयेच् छनैश् शिष्यान् शिवभक्तान् प्रबोधयेत्॥ १८

The teaching of knowledge can be done in different languages, whether it be संस्कृत, द्रामिड (तमिऴ्) or other देशभाषाषा-s or प्राकृत. The teacher can employ worldly usage (लौकिक शब्दैश्च) if necessary or local works. There is great emphasis on audience-focused teaching. The blessings that reading, writing, contemplating, causing others to read & contemplate the आगम-s, bring to the person & the blessings their exposition bring to the king & the people. 

And the text goes back to the ritual of consecrating the seat where the scriptures will be kept. Note the last point that the middle of the leaf-bundle is to be visualized as शिव & the top/bottom sides as शक्ति. This symbolizes the idea that शिव‘s “body” is शक्ति & he’s the self.

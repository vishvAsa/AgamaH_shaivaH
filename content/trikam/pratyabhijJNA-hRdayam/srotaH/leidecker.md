PREFATORY NOTE 

THE present authorized translation of the Pratyabhi jñahrdayam with Notes by Dr. Kurt F. Leidecker, M.A., Ph.D., is based upon the translation of the work in German by Dr. Emil Baer, Ph.D. 

Going through the typescript sent by Dr. Leidecker, (for the extremely neat and beautiful way in which it had been prepared for the Press, one could not feel sufficiently grateful), I noticed that he had given only the English translation of each sūtra and not the original Saṁskệt text also. It occurred to me that the public may be served better if the original text of each sūtra was given along with its English translation; and I wrote to Mr. Leidecker enquiring if he was agreeable to the suggestion and offering, if he was agreeable, to undertake the work of incorpo rating the original Samskrt text. He agreed enthu siastically stating that it will materially enhance the usefulness and appeal of the volume." Thus it is that the Saṁskst text of each saira is now seen in this work alongside of its English translation. 

From the published catalogues of the various Libraries where Oriental Manuscripts and printed works are collected and preserved, it is gathered that the available MSS. of the Pratyabhijñahrdayan are as follows :

THE PRATYABHIJNĀ SYSTEM AND THE 

SAIVA SIDDHĀNTA 

BETWEEN the idealist non-dualist school of Saivism developed in Kashmir and the realist pluralist Saiva doctrine that has grown in South India, there is con siderable agreement in externals, but difference in fundamentals. Both systems recognize three cate gories-pati, pas'u and pās'a ; but while they are all equally ultimate for the Siddhānta (though not all equally independent), pati constitutes the sole reality for the Pratyabhijña school, this reality gradually through its own energy anfolding the world on itself as the screen, and dividing itself into corresponding and mutually related subjects and objects. The Lord is both the material and the ellicient cause for the idealist school, whereas, for the other, He is only the efficient cause ; He can be spoken of as the material cause, because what does develop into the Universe is a potency of His (not svarūpa-sakti, but parigraha-s'akti) which has to function in dependence on Him; if this mode of speech contents those who maintain an abhinna-nimittopādanakāraṇa, they are welcome to it; but not in any normally intelligible sense can the Lord

be the material cause. The idealist school would take literally the scriptural promise of the knowledge of all on the knowledge of the One and consequently seek to derive the many from the One; the realist school would see no more in this promise than in the possibility of knowing a person's dependents as a consequence of knowing that person ; if you know the king you cannot but know his ministers too. 

Though not under the name of 'pratyabhijñā ', re cognition plays quite an important part in the Sid dhānta scheme of salvation ; it is recognition of the soul's natural state as essential intelligence, not, however as identical with the Lord, but as dependent on and informed by His intelligence; the parable of the king's son who had been captured and brought up by gipsies finds as important a place in this as in the allied Sānkhya system, a release is realization of the alienness of the present habits and habitat, and of the true nature of oneself as essentially free of these ; the freedom is never complete, though, since there still is and always will be dependence on the Lord; “perfect freedom” for the Siddhānta as for the Christian Prayer-Book is service of the Lord. 

For the idealist school the sole reality is neither cognizer nor cognized but essential intelligence that differentiates itself into these two forms; in release there is merger into cit again. For the Siddhānta,

however, the soul always is and will be a cognizer; the light of its own intelligence is weak; it has always to function in and through another ; in the state of bond age, it is through the worlds, organs, enjoyments, etc., provided by māyā, that the soul cognizes and functions ; when it has been weaned away from these, what the soul does is neither to be merged in the supreme intelli gence nor to become a tool of that intelligence, but to know and function with the help of and in dependence on that intelligence; pās'a-jñāna gives place to pati-jñāna, knowledge in dependence on the intelligence that is the Lord; throughout, both in bondage and release, the soul continues to be a knower and enjoyer. This is the Siddhāntin's great objection to ekātmavāda; if in release I am not enjoyer, who else is there to enjoy ?! It is no answer to suggest that the Lord enjoys through me; how can His enjoyment constitute satisfaction for me who thirst for it? 

The insistence on the centrality of the jīva is the distinctive feature of the Siddhānta school. Non dualism too is accepted; it is a non-dualism, however, not of substance, but of essence. God and the soul are different entities, but are non-different in nature. This is the purport of the Upanişadic declaration of unity, “ekam eva advitīyam"; it is not that "there are not two", but that "they are not two." ? 

Bondage, says the Pratyabhijñā, is due to one's own s'aktis. This is true in a very limited and 

* Cf. Vitavenba, vv. 6, 7, ? Mapadiyanı, p. 121. 3 Pratyabhijñahrdaya, sūtra 12. 

modified sense for the Siddhānta too. It is the nature of the soul to take on the colour of its associates. Be cause of the connate defilement of āņava it fails to realize its own essential intelligence; it moves in close association with māyā, which is non-intelligent and itself behaves as if non-intelligent. When by good conduct, purification and concentrated contemplation it has turned from matter to spirit and abides in constant association with spirit, it finally and for ever realizes itself too to be spirit; no longer does it confound its own self with matter. Bondage and release thus derive from the innate character of the soul; but this innate character has to be manisested only in dependence on the grace of the Lord. It will always be a difficulty for the non-dualist to conceive duality of substance along with non-dualism in essence; but whether it can be made intelligible or not, that is the Siddhāntin's doctrine. 

As already indicated, final release comes through enlightenment, jñāna, in both schools, though the content of this jñāna is different in the two. Virtuous conduct, the performance of ritual, the observance of austerities, yogic discipline, all these are but prelimina ries to jñāna. There is no reason why jñāna should not arise even in this life, even while the body persists. He for whom it has arisen will be a jīvanmukta. But about the status and characteristics of the jīvanmukta there are differences due to basic differences in their view of matter. In the Advaita Vedānta, māyā is destroyed on release; according to the Pratyabhijñā 

'Sivajñanabodhan, sútra 8, adhikarana 1, and the Mapadiyam thereon.school, the duality of subject and object is a growth which is characteristic of bondage and is resolved with release, in which state there is no non-spirit that can exist over against spirit to act on or be cognized by the latter; for the Siddhānta, however, matter is real; what is destroyed at release is neither matter, nor āņava which causes the soul to cognize itself as if it were finite, but only the conjunction of soul with āņava ; according to one variety of Siddhanta teaching, it is only one of the numerous potencies of āņava that is destroyed at the release of each soul. In view of the Siddhānta position that substance is nothing other than the quali ties, considered as an aggregate, it is highly question able how far the persistence of āņava is intelligible despite the destruction of its potencies, one by one; and even on the view that what is destroyed is the conjunction, the same difficulty arises, since conjunc tion is not an independent category but has to be treated as a quality. Be this as it may, matter, that is to say, pāsa, in a general way, does survive release, though it has ceased to bind; but the fear of its binding again cannot for ever be dispelled, so long as its existence is conceded. Hence it is that in this school the jīvanmukta does not appear as enjoying unrestrain ed freedom. In the Paramarthasara, a text of the Pratyabhijñā school, it is said of the jīvanmukta : " Feeding on whatso may come, wearing raiment of anything, still of spirit, dwelling wherever he chance to come, he finds redemption, being the self of all beings. 

See Sivagrabhaşya (Madras grantha edition). pp. 461-463. "Pauşkarabhaşya, pp. 455-460.

Though he causes hundreds of thousands of asva. medhas to be offered, or hundreds of thousands of brahmins to be slain, he that knows the Supreme Verity is not affected by merit or by guilt but remains stainless.... Conceit, joy and the rest of these passions arises from the illusion of differentiation; how should he be affected thereby who has the vision of the Self in unity? There is naught distinct from himself to which he should offer praise or oblation; will he rejoice in praise and the like, who is said to have passed beyond worship and hallelujah ? His temple is his, own body and that which is other, built of the thirty six elements, and fully set with windows consisting of the bodily organism, or composed of jars, etc.” ! In explaining the latter half of the last verse the com mentator, Yoga Muni, says : " The whole phenomenal world is to the thinker a temple of His own indwelling consciousness." In marked contrast to this is the final sūtra of the Sivajñanabodha : " muktyai prāpya satas teşām bhajed vesam s'ivālayam." This would seem to mean that for the sake of release one is to resort to the company of the saintly and offer adoration both to their external appearance as well as to temples of S'iva ; and the commentator on the Sanskrit text, Sivāgra Yogin, takes it to relate to one who belongs to the lowest grade of eligibles, who is competent only for the dāsa-mārga, the path of service, as contrasted with the paths of jñāna and antaranga-bhakti. The Tamil version, however, says: “Having got rid of the defile. 

Paramarthasara, vv. 69, 70, 72, 73, 74 (English translation by Dr. L. D. Barnett, Journal of the Royal Asiastic Society, 1910).

ment that prevents attainment of the feet of the Lord, he consorts with devotees and worships as S'iva the vestments of these devotees as well as temples of (Siva)." Though the mood used is the present indicative, the commentator, Sivajñānamuni, holds that, in the light of words used by Meykaņdār, the Tamil redactor, in his elaboration of the verse, the sūtra is prescriptive of the duties of the jivanmukta and not merely descriptive of his acts. In spite of external conformity, then, in the admission of jīvanmukti, the Siddhānta is far removed from the teaching of the idealist school of Saivism. The external trappings are the same, whether in the enunciation of the padārthas and tattvas or the naming of the causes of bondage and the means to release. But in the conception of the essential character and inter-relations of these, there is profound divergence, a divergence which cannot but have been due to the outlook on life and the tempera mental make-up of the individuals or groups among whom the different schools developed. Either hypo thesis is possible--that one of the schools is fundmental and that the other (or others) grew by gradual stages of moving away from the initial emphases, or that both kinds of thought existed from the earliest stages fostered by and influencing different sets of disciples. An inquiry into the ultimate superiority of either hypo thesis is fascinating, but hardly within the limits of this supplement

ON THE SPELLING AND PRONOUNCIA 

TION OF SANSKRIT WORDS 

Except in titles and quotations----where, on the whole, the spelling of the original is kept, the system of transliteration which has been used here is that adopted by the American Oriental Society in its publications. 

For the general reader we append the following remarks on the current western pronounciation of the Transliterated Sanskrit words which, it must be, is only approximate. 

1. The Vowels. 

a like the u in but. ā like the a in card, i like the i in it. 1 like the ee in meet. u like the u in cushion. 

like the u in lute, ļ like the re in Freneh chambre, * 

ļ like an l of the quality of r, 2. The Diphthongs.* 

e like the a in tale. āi like an a and i following quickly. o like the o in mode, äu like the ou in loud.

3. The Consonants.

house, top-heavy, Mob-house * etc. ii, vi, n, ñ, ņ are indiscriminately pronounced like the 

nasal in French sans. 

s' and ş like the ski in shine. For the accent of Sanskrit words the Latin rules may suffice in general. If the last but one syllable is long-be it in virtue of a long vowel (a, i, u, e, o, ai, au) or a double consonant following a short vowel -- then it takes the accent ; otherwise the accent moves to the preceding syllable, 

The plural of Sanskrit nouns is formed here simply by an s without regard to the real plural formation of the Sanskrit.

1. EDITING RELIGIOUS-PHILOSOPHIC TEXTS SYMP 

TOMATIC OF AN INDIAN RENAISSANCE 

The ancient cultures of the East are in a state of ferment. The West has acted the part of a leaven among the stagnating masses. Political and social movements are, for the Occidental observer, in the foreground. But accompanying them there are spirit ual movements of no less importance. 

In the latter we notice two tendencies of which one or the other at different times becomes more prominent. The watchword of the one is assimilation to Western culture by surrendering ancient heritage, that of the other the rejuvenation of the highest values of one's own past. Both these tendencies seem to be incompatible, though in reality they enter into a variety of combinations, 

What we have said holds true for the Islamic world and the Far East, but probably most of all with respect to India. And here, it seems, the second of the tendencies just mentioned is especially marked. India of old experiences a kind of renaissance. Stirred by Western culture, encouraged by the interest wide 

PRATYABHIJÑAHŞDAYAM 

circles of the Occident show in India, challenged, on the other hand, by the growing successes of Christian ity in India, the Indian is reminded of his past and spiritual powers rise from a millennial sleep. 

It is not solely the zeal of European scholars that brings to light the literary treasures of India which their guardians once attempted to withhold. The Indians themselves edit them and thus try to mobilize the powers of the past against the growing influence of the West. 

In this connection must be mentioned the edition of Texts and Studies prepared since 1911 in Srinagar by the Archaeological and Research Department of Kashmir State, under the auspices of the Mahārā ja of Kashmir. It appears that one branch of the great tree of Shivaism wakens to new life. It flowered in Kashmir from the 9th until about the 14th century of our era. In the first half of that period Shivaism produced, in respect of content and volume, a not insignificant religious-philosophical literature. How ever, losing power it vegetated side by side with Islam in the mountain valley of Srinagar until a short time ago. If there were, up to that time, only a few Kashmirian Brahmans who still read the old manuscripts (most of them were satisfied with two single small compendiums)', we have today already a considerable series of texts, beautifully printed, edited and collated with the best available codices by Indians, and, in part, by men trained in Europe.

INTRODUCTION 

II. IMPORTANCE OF THE TEXTS FOR THE SCIENCE 

OF MISSIONS AND INDOLOGY 

From two points of view these texts appear to be noteworthy, that is, from the missionary point of view on the one hand, and that of the Indologist on the other. 

The Christian missionary ought to acquaint him self with this form of Shivaism ; but not he alone. 'For,' as Schomerus' rightly remarks, 'if the mission in India is to solve its task, it needs the help of scienti fic theology. Just as Christianity had to discuss in a scientific manner views of the Greek and Roman world in order to establish itself in the Old World, so it has to discuss scientifically the Indian world view, if it is to rule in India. Na 

Such a discussion will be the more necessary the higher and more dignified the forms are in which the Ilindu religious spirit expresses itself. But exactly with such, indeed, we have to do in Kashmir Shivaism. Closely related to the Southern Shivaism of the Tamuls it represents, together with the latter, the noblest development of the otherwise rather frequently repelling Shivaitic Hinduism. 

On the other hand, the Kashmir texts demand to a high degree the interest of Indologists as sources for the history of Indian religion and philosophy. Barnett, who is one of the few Europeans who know Kashmir Shivaism, says in the Introduction to the 

Schomerus, Sh. S., Preface, page vi. 

PRATYABHIJNAHRDAYAM 

Lalla-vakyani which appeared in 1920': Very little is yet known in Europe concerning the tenets of this form of Hinduism.' But again, in his preface he points to the strong influence which this system at one time exercised over the whole peninsula from that far-off corner of Northwestern India. In a letter to me of the 23rd of October, 1922, he writes: 'I am convinced that it is immensely important for the literary history of India.' 

Thus, the present work may be of use to the Christian mission in Iodia as well as to research workers in the Occident. In this lies its justification. But because the work addresses itself also to non indologists, many an explanation is made necessary which may appear superfluous to the specialist. 

III. THE FRATYABHIJNĀ HIRDAYA-VALUE OF THE TEXT IN THE OPINION ON THE SHIVAITIC 

COMMUNITY AND THE EDITOR 

1 

That out of the numerous texts of the series I selected just this one was due to the fact that, along with the two already translated texts it appeared to me to be one of the most iinportant. The two above mentioned points of view also influenced my selection. 

In the first place, the Pratyabhijñahşdaya is one of those two compendiums which are used to this very day as religious text-books and catechisms among the believing in Kashmir. And that it enjoys a great

INTRODUCTION 

practical reputation also among the Shivaites of the South is clear from the fact that, as Barnett writes me, it had been edited in 1918 at Madras by V. R. Subrahmanya Aiyar with a Tamil translation and in 1920 at Amalapuram by M. Lakshminarasinham together with an interpretation in Telugu.' 

Again, the great scientific importance of the text could be surmised after the comparatively detailed discussion by M. S. Kaula, A Short Review of the Research Publications (Kashmir State), as well as from the words of the meditor, J. C. Chatterji, who says of it in the preface : t bears the same relation to the Adväita Shaivä System of Kashmir as the Vedanta-sära of Sadananda does to the Vedānta System. That is to say, it is intended to be an easy introduction to, and a summary of the doctrines of, the System.' Whether the text really deserves the epithet 'easy,' the reader may judge for himself. But the surmise as to the importance of the text has been confirmed in the course of translating; indeed, it presents an introduction into the system and a com pendium of its most important doctrinal material. Only later did I become aware, through a footnote in Winternitz, G.I.L., 313, p. 445, that also V. S. Ghate, Ind. Ant. 42 (1913), p. 217f., in his discussion of the Sivasūtravimarś'inī and the Pratyabhijñahraya re conimends the latter as a handbook for the introduction to Kashmir Shivaism. 

'In passing, it should be noted that, according to Barnett, these are the only translations, or commentaries on our text which liave been published. 

Because of their language they were not taken into account here!

IV. TRANSMISSION OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND 

THE EDITION OF THE TEXT 

The Pratyabhijñahsdayı appears in Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum under the full name of Isvara pratyabhijñahşdaya. As manuscript it is noted in : 

1. Notices of Sanskrit Manuscripts, by Räjendra lāla Mitra, Calcutta, 1871-1890. 

2. Detailed Report of a Tour in Search of Skt VSS made in Kashmir, Rajputāna and Central India, by G. Bühler, Bombay, 1877-8. 

3. Lists of Skt MSS discovered in Oudh during the year 1879, prepared by Pundit Devïprasāda, Allahabad, 1879. 

4. Catalogue of Skt MSS in the Library of the India Office. Part IV. Philosophy and Tantra. London, 1894. 

5. Catalogue of the Ski MSS in the Raghunatha Temple Library of liis Haghness the Mahāräja of Jamnu and Kashinir. Prepared by M. A. Stein, Bombay, 1894. 

The text was edited, as Chatterji says in the preface, on the basis of a collation of four manuscripts (designated ka, kha, ga and 11), of which ka is written in Devanāgari, kha, ga and ñ in Sarada. Kha is said to be badly time-worn, ga to be a paper manu script and in a birchbark manuscript. Ga belongs to a Pandit of the Department, iż comes from Lahore. More precise data about these manuscripts are not

given by Chatterji. Neither do the rather numerous variations which are printed in the text allow of any certain conclusions as to the character of the manu scripts. Nevertheless, in translation and explanation I have been thankful for readings that differ from Chatterji's text. These I have occasionally referred to in the notes. 

V. LITERARY VALUE OF THE TEXT 

In all great religions, but especially in the Indian religions, there may be distinguished three types of textbooks, according to Rudolf Otto :' 

1. The popular devotional textbooks. Imbedded as poems of instruction in Fpos and Purānas, they come down from times in which religion had not yet split into strict, orthodox, dogmatic systems and schools. 

2. Textbooks of a definite, rigid, dogmatic type. They represent and propose to set forth a certain church doctrine. But they do it in a popular form and on that account are comparable, perhaps, to catechisms. 

3. Textbooks in the strictest sense. 

The Pratyabhijñahsdaya corresponds exactly to the definition of the second kind. As the author himself says in the introduction and in the final paragraph, in composing it he had in mind readers who, lacking any special training in logic, are incapable of comprehending the real textbooks (those mentioned 

'Otto, Vişnu-Narayana. 

PRATYABHIJÑĀHĶDAYAM 

Cill 

under No. 3). However, when I reflect on the diffi culties which certain sections of the text have caused me, I should have to remind myself shamefacedly and with secret envy of those simple people in Kashmir of old with whom I could hardly compete in in tellectual sagacity, if I did not know of other cases in which such remarks of Indian philosophers about the purpose of their works are not to be taken too seriously. 

Besides this, the Pratyabhijñahrdaya belongs to those textbooks that wish to be commentaries to sutras. The sūtras are aphorisms in briefest form which contain the whole doctrine by implication and are intended to serve as aids to memory. Such sutras are supplement ed by commentaries which develop the doctrine by reaching often far beyond the suggestions of the sūtra. In older works of this kind sntras, as a rule, are by some authority of the past, while the commentary is by a student, or one who keeps up the tradition, or a later authority. In the later literary products of this kind, the author of the sūtras also frequently composed the commentary to them. 

The Pratyabhijñahrdayıı represents this older type ; it is made up of twenty sītras by an unknown author and Kșemarāja's commentary. 

"The Tarkasangraha is said to represent an elementary textbook of Indian Logic for the instruction of boys. 

Thus, c.g., Kallata himself commenteel in the so-called? Vrtti his Spunder karikas. The Spandakarika is in sõitro form and constitutes an important work for Kashmir Shivaism. 

: The name designates primarily the commentator and not, as Winternitz, G.L.L., 33, p. 445 n. 2, thinks, the sütros. 

INTRODUCTION 

VI. AUTHORSHIP AND TIME OF COMPOSITION 

In the colophon the author calls himself Rājānaka Ksemarāja, student of Abhinavagupta. Kșemarāja ought not to be confused with other writers of the same or a similar name, as, e.g., the medical student Ksemarāja, alias Kșemas'arman,' or his contemporary in Kashmir, the prolific writer Kșemendra. The latter, in his earlier years also zealously worshipped Shiva, but was later converted to Visnuism." 

As to the chronology we are extremely fortunate in view of the conditionis in India. The basis for dating events at that time is the historical work of the Kashmirian Kalhana, tie Rajatarangiņi (Kalhana, R.). This work, unparalleled in the whole of Sanskrit literature, was completed by the author in 1148 and throws much light on just those centuries of the history of Kashmir in which our Shivaite philosophers were living. Thus, we are able to date at least two of the philosophers, Kallața and Abhinavagupta. The former, according to the Rajataraiigini, belongs in the second half of the 9th century when his own dates are checked with the Rajataranyinī. His pupil, Ksemarāja, must therefore also have lived and written in the first half of the 11th century of our era. 

Kșemarāja belongs in point of time to the last of a long succession of Kashmirian Shivaitic teachers and writers. But he seems to have been the most successful

VII. BRIEF SKETCH OF THE DOCTRINE OF RECOG NITION ACCORDING TO THE PRATYABHIJÑĀHRDAYA 

The main topics of the doctrine are God, world, soul and salvation. This brief sketch may serve as an introduction to the study of the text. For all details, the notes are to be consulted. 

The basic idea is the identity of God (Shiva), soul and world. The world is no illusion as in the Vedānta. It is absolutely real. Instead of being separated from God and the soul-as in the later Sankhya-the world is identical with them. 

The actual process of the world is enacted in four phases (the system, however, has five) which correspond to the four main phases of psychical life. They are regarded as the cternally enduring spiritual experi ence of God. This expression is not to be taken 

12 

PRATYABHIJÑAHRDAYAM 

lei 

metaphorically. We have here an experience of God in the fullest sense of the word. For the world is in reality nothing else than the psychical life of the All-soul projected outwardly. Shiva awakens: the world of phenomena potentially latent within himself blazes up. He is awake : the world exists. He goes to sleep: the world is drawn back into himself and disappears. He is asleep: the world rests within himself as a potential magnitude till the new day of the world. (The fifth 

phase will be mentioned later in the treatment of soteriology). Thus, the world is nothing other than the objectified content of the consciousness of the divine soul, and as such identical with it. God is cause as well as effect and is the causa efficiens and causa materialis of the world at one and the same time. In answer to the question as to what imparts the impetus to the process of the world, the doctrine of svatantrya, i.e., the sovereignty of God's will, says : it is the will of God which is a pripnum datum, 

The development of the world is, rightly under stood, the work of citi, world-reason, or parāvāc, the eternal word, or parās'akti the highest power, all of which are considered identical with each other and with Shiva. Here we have to do with different points of view which run side by side and whose harmoniza tion cannot be said to be wholly successful. 

In connection with citi appears tattva, meaning suchness,' principle, elementma concept known from the Sānkhya. Citi allows the All to divide itself into thirty-six (or thirty-five) tattvas which represent a

ome 

scale from the highest and purest to the lowest and grossest principle. The totality of the phenomena of the universe are, in some way or other, reducible to them. 

Parāvūc, which in the development of the world goes through several phases of growing sensualization, is differentiated into the 50 letters of the Sanskrit alphabet. These represent and, in agreement with ancient Indian speculation, are, in fact, the elements out of which the universe is built. 

More important, however, is the rôle played in our system by parasakit. It is sakti which, in the later parts of the text comes to the foreground more and more and dominates the entire thought to such an extent that Shiva is surprisingiy neglected. Sakti reigns throughout the universe by means of the innumerable subordinate s'aktis which, arranged in circles, become just as many manifestations of the highest s'akti. 

If it is more particularly the idea of matter which is inherent in the concept tattva, in the case of sakti it is the idea of power. The phenomenal universe is thought of as a varied play of forces, good and evil, friendly and hostile to man, and towering behind them all in mysterious, terrifying grandeur is parās'akti. 

With this we have already indicated another more important difference between tattva and s'akti. The mental attitudes out of which both these concepts originate are totally distinct. With tattva it is the 

14 

PRATYABHI NAHRDAYAM 

cold abstraction of philosophic thinking ; with sakti it is constructive imagination born of religious feeling. In s'akti-worship especially there is manifested most clearly that passionate religious movement of Hinduism which inclines towards the female deity. In contrast with this, the mythological concepts which, in the carlier sections of the text, appear occasionally in conjunction with the tattva speculation, are predominantly masculine (Sadasiva, Isvara, Siva Bhattāraka). 

Again, the psychology of the system is linked with citi also. In the process of the world development citi becomes through progressive limitations citta, the organ of thought for the individual soul. As to the souls themselves, they are nothing other than Shiva who, in virtue of his sovereign will, suffers limitation. Descend ing through seven stages (including the highest) he is narrowed down more and more. Of course, the limitation of a knowing subject corresponds exactly to that of the object, because the world is always the objectified content of the soul's consciousness. More over, the doctrine of the three malas (mala means dirt, soiled garment) becomes prominent here also. These three malas gradually obscure the individual souls and hinder their salvation. 

· The aim of all Indian philosophy is salvation, that is, liberation from the compulsion of sansara, the cycle of rebirths, transmigration of soul. Now, soteriology corresponds here as in other systems exactly to cosmology, or rather, cosmogony, only with reversed 

INTRODUCTION 

15 sequence of the particular processes. The soul is liberated by reversing the limitations acquired in the course of world development. Citta has to become citi again, while the individual, freeing himself from the malas, must again become Shiva. 

Otherwise, the ideas in soteriology are just as divers and heterogeneous as they are in cosmology. Indeed, they even appear to be less reconciled and more contradictory than in cosmology. There corres ponds to each of the above-mentioned three kinds of cosmogonic developments a particular way of salvation. 

The first is that of philosophic insight. It is called pratyabhijña, 'recognition, from which the whole system receives its name, He who discovers again within himself Shiva, i.es, he who, according to the propounded doctrine recognizes that his true self is identical with Shiva and the world, is liberated. Requisites for this knowledge are interpretation of the truth by a good teacher and devotion and firmness on the part of the student in the pursuit of truth. 

The second method, which, to be sure, is rather subordinate in our text, being hinted at only in occasional suggestions, is that of the mantras. He who learns to use the magic formulae through a teacher and acquires thereby mantravīrya, mantra power-because the formulas are composed of the syllables representing the cosmic elements, i.e., the 

'In the Sivasūtravimarś'ini, ic, Ksemaraja's commentary to the fundamental work on Kashmir Shivaism, this problem is treated inuch more in detail. 

16 

PRATYABHIJNĀHRDAYAM 

products of the differentiation of paravac--gains lord ship over those elements and, hence, salvation. 

The third and, to judge from the extent of the discussion devoted to it, by far the most important method of salvation is connected very intimately with the sakti doctrine. We mean Yoga, more particularly a form of it which may be said to be a preliminary to the later Hathayoga. By means of breath constraint and fixation of citta on certain parts of the human body that represent the microcosm, the Yogin acquires mastery over the saktes. Thus, from being dangerous deceivers, the s'aktis become serviceable to salvation. 

However, these three methods are not clearly separated, but coalesce in various ways. They all are agreed on the fact that man himself effects his own salvation. Now, as is from another world, there projects into the system the idea of grace, yes, even a kind of predestination, thus altogether complicating soteriology and leading the system into contradictions which remain unsolved. 

Similar to erratic rocks, two concepts are imbedded in the system : anugraha, the dispensation of grace, and s'aktipata, the descent of s'akti. Anugraha is called the fifth phase in the cosmo-psychological process. through which the soul finally overcomes the four other phases of sainsära and reaps salvation. In s'aktipata Shiva intervenes as saviour (in virtue of the sovereignty of his will) in the life of the individual soul which could not partiake of salvation through its own power.

VIII. RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT 

The present study is limited to the Pratyabhi jñahsdaya. Only those problems and materials have found recognition which are immediately connected with and treated by the text. A final appreciation of the system of Kashmir Shivaism from the metaphysical, theological, religious-philosophical and epistemological point of view will be possible only after an investi gation of the other texts, above all the works of the dogmatists proper, Somananda, Utpalācārya and Abhinavagupta. Then only will it be possible to solve further problems which have so far been answered in a rather contradictory fashion. We mean the question as to the relation of Kashmin Shivaism to the Saiva siddhānta of the South and to other Shivaitic systems as well as the connection with the other philosophical and religious systems, especially the Vedānta and Sankhya. The present study cannot and does not wish to be more than a contribution towards research into the still dark and mysterious field of Indic literature, philosophy and religion. 

Where these problems have been dealt with however inadequately till now—the bibliography tells by an asterisk (*) affixed to the works in question.

There are some who, still undeveloped of thought, do not take the trouble imposed by a textbook based on acute reflection, but who, nevertheless, long after the samăves'a' with the highest Lord which fowers forth with the descent of sakti. If devoted, they will receive here some explanation of the truth that serves to instruct in recognizing the Lord [within]. 

To prove on this occasion that, in consequence of the divinity of its own self (citi)? operates as cause in all things, that in it may be found access to happiness and great reward, he said : 8 

Sutra 1 : The absolute' citi is the cause when the universe is in the process of becoming perfected." 

When the universe is in the process of becoming perfected means as much as when [all suchnesses] from Sadasiva to the earth" emerge. When [thus21

"चितिरेव हेतुः । न त्वसौ कश्चित् । अत एव देशकाला the universe is] shining forth, which really is to become existent, as well as when being re-absorbed, which really is quiescences of the pramatr, citi is the cause. [Citi] is identical with the highest s'akti,l is exalted, absolute, consists of the highest reason [and] is not distinct from Sivabhattaraka. (Cause] is that which effects. 

For, when [citi] emerges, the world awakens and becomes existent, falling asleep when [citi's] emer gence is reversed. One's own experience even gives testimony to that fact. 

The other, however, that starts with māya 18 and prakrti l' and is distinct from the light of cit, is nowhere a cause. Inasmuch as [the other] does not emerge, it is not real. But in the state of emerging, the luminous citi alone is, indeed, the cause, since light is its only essence. 

The other one, however, does not exist [yet].

Hence, place, time and form, [all of which have been] created and vitalized by (citi), are incapable of differentiating (citi's) real mature ; because (citi) is all pervading, eternal and of unlimited fulness. 

Thus formulated, this [commentary] agrees with the meaning [of the sutra). 

Then, is not also the worid nothing insofar as it is scvered from cit? And how could there be a causally conditioned existence in that state of unity ?—thus one 

might object.20 

Only cit it is, the exalted one, qualified by its luminous absoluteness, which flashes in the real essence of the unlimited world then in existence. These words convey that this highest comprehensive reality is effect and cause [at one and the same time). 

(Cit) alone is the cause when the world, which consists of pramāts, pramària“ and prameya, is in the process of becoming perfected, i.e., shines forth.

This being so, there is, consequently, a poor demonstra tion in proof of the existence (of cit), which is absolute and possesses its own unlimited light, neither necessary nor appropriate," being such as would have to supply continually new reasons (for it). 

This is declared in the Trikasara24 as follows: 

As one might try to jump with one's own foot over the shadow 

___of one's own head, And yet the head will never be at the place of one's foot-just 

so it is with this baindavī kala." 

Furthermore, (citi) being the cause when the universe is in the process of becoming perfected no less than when it is re-absorbed, is, therefore, absolute. [In the re-absorption], the palatable as is reduced to identity with the highest duallessness. Should (citi's) absoluteness be recognized, it causes all [supernatural] powers ?? which consist essentially in enjoyment and liberation.

In this manner one should explain [the doctrine] by repetition. 

____From another point of view,s the universe is blue, pleasure, 30 the body, life and so forth." Its process of becoming perfected is the aves'a 33 of the reasoning pramat; as it folloivs from the evolutionary series of pramaņas. As such it is the cause, in the sense of a means (of citi) in the knowledge process. 

Thereby it is asserted that [here we have] a way to happiness. As is stated in the excellent Vijñana bhattaraka: 

Common to all souls is the (naïvel consciousness (of the 

existence) of objects and subjects; The Yogins, however, have the distinction of being mindful 

of their relation. 34 Citi, the singular, denoting the unlimitedness of place, time and so forth, 36 shows that all followers of the

doctrine of non-identity labor under an error. The word absolute indicates that great splendor is the essence of cit, thus marking the difference [from the concept] of the Brahman cloctrine. The word begin ning (in the original of the sutra] with universe cleclares that (cit) possessos unlimited power, that it is able to effect everything and that in it may be found a way to happiness and great reward. 

Even though {admitting that] citi is the cause of the universe, could one, nevertheless, cling to the doctrine of non-identity insofar as citi would pre suppose a causa materialis” together with its effects ? Fearing this, he said : 

Sutra 2 : By the power of its own will (citi) unfolds the universe upon its own screen." 

___By the power of its own will, not, to be sure, by the will of another, as the Brahman [coctrine) and

Moreover, only (by the power of its own will), and not on the presupposi tion of a causa materialis together with its effects. For, in this case, the possibility of an [absolute] cit would be untenable because the aforesaid absoluteness would vanish. 

___Upon its own screen, but nowhere else, (cit) unfolds the above defined universe, which, though [appearing] different [from cit] yet is identical with it, like a city (seen) in a mirror.99 Furthermore, unfolding means manifestation of a mode of existence. Because of the fact that the light (of cit) is the sole essence of the world, one speaks of a state (avasthana). 

Now, in order to make the real nature of the universe intelligible through analysis, he said: 

Sutra 3 : This (universe) is manifold in conse quence of the separation of mutually related objects and subjects.41

This, that is to say, the universe, is manifold, in other words, of many forms. Why? In consequence of the separation, that is, in consequence of the multi formity of objects and subjects which are mutually related, that is, are in a state of reciprocal adaptation." 

So, (on the one hand], in the suchness of Sada sira." Corresponding to the entirety of the object which includes antitheses and consists of a 'this' (idantä) veiled and [hence] obscured by a self (ahanta),*3 is, at this stage], the group of pramatars, called mantramahes'varas, who are governed by the blessed Lord Sadasiva and whose state of existence, as it appears, has been brought about by the will of the highest Lord. 

In the suchness of Isvara," [on the other hand], the entirety of the object consists essentially in a co-ordination of a distinct 'this' (idantů) and a self (ahanti)." To it there corresponds exactly the group of mantresvaras " governed by the Lord Isvara.

The three-headed Bhairava is present in person and extends 

to the ends of the universe, Therein the following is implied. Because light is its only true nature, and as an application of the [just] mentioned Agamas " evinces, this [cetana as] subject too consists merely of Shiva who forms the body of the universe. It appears as if it were contracted because--due to its māya-s'akti—its true nature is not displayed. Because it unfolds itself as cit in accord with its only nature, the contraction, likewise, proves upon closer examination to be entirely of the nature of cit and nothing else. Hence every subject is identical with Sivabhattāraka who forms the body of the universe.

This has been formulated by myself as follows:

remains; If it does appear in virtue of its being of the nature of the 

appearance, then appearance remains (also]." With this in view, the identity of Shiva with jīva"? is proclaimed in the excellent Spanda-textbooks * where, after the introductory words : 

Because jiva consists of the universe ... we read :

Sutra 5 : Citta is only cit descended from the stage of cetana and passed into a condition of limitation due to the object of perception. 

___In reality, citta is nothing else. [To say it once more], it is the exalted (citi). Now, if (citi), preserv ing secretly its own real nature, subjects itself to limitation, then the process is twofold. Sometimes it flashes with cit prevailing, subordinating (to itself] the

____In the event cit prevails, that is, when, in the nature of the case the [divine) light is predominant, then vijnanakala is pramatr. But when the [divine] light is being impaired, then vidya" is pramāt. Even here where, step by step. [cit) has reached corporeality by limitation, the independent nature of the Lord Sadasiva is apparent. 

But, wherever cit holds the supremacy won by ardent endeavor to reach samadhi, there the pramatr ship of the pure path "' has reached by stages the highest degree. Where, however, limitation is domi nant, pramatr-ship of the void, etc.i" is present. 

This being so, citta is nothing else than citi in the form of the limited subject [and] descended from the stage of cetana, that is, bent on comprehending objects. [Furthermore, citta is only citi which], due to the object of perception, in other words, in virtue of the

In entities which manifest themselves in their own bodies, 

sattva, rajas and tamasanshi Bear the same relation to pas'u as to jñāna, kriyā and māyā 

as third * to pati, 

Thus, beginning with this (sloka, the following] is stated in the excellent Pratyabhijna. Citi-saktis is of an absolute nature and appears as jñana, kriya and maya s'akti. In consequence of the excessive limitation it flashes in the pas'u state as citta whose nature consists in sattva, rajas and tamas. 

Hence, for the sake of tracing (citta) even in the state of vikalpa because [it] is of the nature of the real, the excellent Tattvagarbhastotra says: 

प्रत्यभिज्ञाहृदयम्

Thinking, however, that citta especially constitutes the real nature of the indyapramatr, he said : 

Sutra 6 : The mayapramatr *consists of it. 

First of all, the sphere of body and life forms the matter ** for citta; but also the sphere of the void, because it is furnished with the sanskaras to that cling to citta. Otherwise the one who follows the common walk of life would not by his own initiative pursue these things. Accordingly, mayapramat, ** consists of citta indeed.

To this end, in the Sivasutras 39 where the matter is discussed, the word is coined: 

Ātman is caitanya. And, further, incidentally when defining mayapramatr: 

Ātman is citta. Since, then, salvation is the result of correct knowl edge of the true nature of (atman), and sainsara that of incorrect [knowledge], he continued in order to analyze this true nature : 

___Sutra 7 : And he is one, of twofold appearance, threefold build, fourfold constitution and a nature divided into seven pentads." 

Reflecting upon these words, it follows that Siva bhattaraka whose essence consists in cit, is but one atman and no other ; because it is impossible that the [divine] light differentiate itself through place, time 

39

and so forth, and because, on the other hand, com prehending subjectivity does not belong to the soulless." 

Inasmuch as the [divine] light-through the sovereignty of its [own] will "--subjects itself to the limitation of life and co-ordinate phenomena and thereby accomplishes that the subject pursues limited aims, it is, therefore, of twofold appearance due to the dual nature made up of the light-form on the one hand and the limited manifestation on the other. 

Owing to his being covered by the mala of anava, māya and karma [Sivabhattaraka] is of threefold 

build. 

Because essentially composed of the void, life, puryaştaka and body, he is of a fourfold constitution. 

The seven pentads, that is, the thirty-five 95 such nesses from Shiva to the earth make up (S'iva bhattaraka's] nature. This expression corresponds also to the fact that he consists of a heptad of pramatars beginning with Shiva and ending with the

When this one is being recognized thus—we mean [when it is realized] that Shiva is one only, that he consists of thirty-five suchnesses, that his nature appears in a heptad of knowledge subjects and his character in a pentad of powers, i.e., spirit (cit) and the rest--then he bestows salvation ; otherwise, however, he leads to samsāra.99 

And hence Sutra 8 : The sthitis ive of all darsanas are his 

roles.101प्रत्यभिज्ञाहदयम्

The followers of the Nyāya "*and those close to them regard the atman almost identical with the suchness of buddhi,'' that is to say, with the substratum of the group of qualities beginning with jnana 198_-but only as long as (atman) is involved in samsara.

The Sankhyas, however, and those having simi lar views cling to the sphere which is characterized in the main by the vijñanakalas.123 

Other knowers of the S'rutyanta o accept as basis the sphere of the Isvara suchness by asserting : ‘In the beginning this (universe) was being.' 125

'Therefore, those who continually occupy themselves with it are saved during lifetime 155 when they realize that the universe consists in the unfolding of their own real nature'--so says the [sacred] tradition concerning them. Those, however, who do not likewise behold the totality of the object differentiated every where. With them the atman remains bound. 

Moreover, the procedure in the authorship of the

There, in the stage thus created he takes delight for a time during which the process of] folding up remains at rest. In the meantime, the goddess of stabilitating imparts existence (to the creation].'59 However, if meditation is added--for which we have as an alternative concept camatkara—then it becomes re-absorbed.160 As the magnificent Rama says : 

Even with the thunderbolt of meditation others are not able 

to split the mountain of manifoldness; 161 But those who are full of power by devotion to you 162 over 

come (parāmxs) and destroy it.

However, if this {creation] generates internally a variform samskara ** of fear and similar [factors) although it is being re-absorbed--then it becomes a samsara seed destined to spring into existence once more and, [as such), is transported 143 into the sphere of 

vilaya.' 

Again, [let there be] this [thing] that has this-wise been steadied internally; or, [let us say], something else that has to be expiated by suffering : if, during hatha paka, it comes to be burned in the fire of the spirit through alangrasa, then he 164 reaches perfection and enters the state of grace.165 

Although the authorship of the fivefold process thus constituted is ever latent in everyone it, neverthe less, does not shine forth without the instruction of a good teacher. Hence, one ought to approach a teacher respectfully so that it may manifest itself.

But he who lacking instruction by a good teacher has no complete knowledge of the authorship of this fivefold process) stays deluded. He is led astray by his own s'aktis " since the true reality of everyone [of these s'aktis) is hid from him. Thus teflecting he said : 

Sutra 12: To be a samsarin means being led astray by one's own saktis when ignorant of that [authorship of the fivefold process]. 

Being led astray by one's own saktis refers to being wedged in between the pointed spikes of the manifold doctrinal opinions of the world. When ignorant means when there is no shining forth because the display of one's own power which becomes effective through the descent of sakti *, 133 is wanting. Of that has reference to this authorship of the fivefold process

What (presents itself] in this fashion is equivalent to being a samsarin. 

In the excellent Sarvavīrabhattaraka this is ex pressed as follows:

The essence of all mantras are the sounds; the essence of 

all sounds is Shiva.*** Now, here we are concerned with the paravak s'akti!? This one is not different from the light of cit, (appcars] in the form of great inantras that sound continually," consists in the perfect consciousness of the I'llis and is pregnant with the whole circle of saktis formed by the sounds from a to kşa." First of all, (this paravak-sakti) brings into apparition the sphere of the [limited] subject through the successive appearances of pasyanti,'*"madhyama * and the other [forms of manifestation].

In (this sphere paravak-saktı), concealing its true form by assuming the form of another (sakti), produces the vikalpa-activity of the maya-subject.** [The latter)-novel and original in every instant--consists in the indistinct appearance of specific objects. Like wise, however, (paravak-sakt)) manifests also the pure sphere of avikalpa im which is yeiled by that (vikalpa activity). Under these circumstances [and] deceived by the manifold s'aktis in the form of ka and the other [consonants] 11 which are presided over by brahini and the rest of the deities, the perplexed human being imagines that the independent atman is limited and consists merely of the body, of life and other [physical constituents]. 

In the pasu stage, brahmi and the other goddesses manifest : 

[1] in the sphere of separation, emanation and stabilitating;

In the pati stage, however, [these goddesses] disclose [in reversed order): 

[1] in separation, re-absorption, and 

[2] in unity, emanation and stabilitating, where by--through a gradual diminution of vikalpa-they unfold 17 the great sphere of avikalpa 10 which consists in the ingress into the blissful bhairavamudra." 

"All these riches are mine"-he who realizes this fully Possesses mähes varya '' even when the vikalpas appear, 

because his self is identical with the all. 

As is stated here, [the above-mentioned goddesses] cause the sakti of pure vikalpans to appear, that is, (the s'akti] of primal shape, deeply sunk in spirit and bliss. Hence, being a samsarin consists, as explained, in being led astray by one's own s'aktis,

Further, [there is another explanation of this sūtra.]?

Now, all these circles ensnare the heart of the pas'u in delusion. 

[B] In the pati stage, however, [citis'ıktij mani fests itself 

[1] as cidgaganacari, whose essence consists in universal doership and the other s'aktis ;

But all these open up the core of pati. 

Damodara, the scholar, who enjoys unfeigned respect in virtue of his innate camatkara, expresses himself in the Vimuktakas likewise : 

With their seat in the knowledge subject, in the inner and 

outer organs and in (objective] existence, the perfect as 

well as the limited, Vāmes'a (Vāmes'varı) and the other [goddesses] are able 

to bring about both, liberation and bondage : through thorough knowledge the one, through lack of knowledge 

the other.143 Thus, being a sarisarin consists in being led astray by one's own s'aktis.

In respect of its knowledge content this siitra has, in the main, been explained already in detail in con nection with the explanation of the previous sütra ; with reference to the wording, however, it will now be explained. 

Full knowledge of it--i.e., of the authorship of the fivefold process that is almau's--we have where the delusion produced by one's own s'aktis has ceased because the source out of which grew the marks of lack of knowledge vanishes [and] absoluteness is being attained. [Thus, wherever we have such knowledge, there] the above explained citta relinquishes being directed outward, which leads to limitation, and becomes citi, that is to say, enters into its most own highest state that consists in cit. [This citta accomplishes] by ascending to the stage of cetana in virtue of its being directed inward."' In other words, [it does it] by arriving slowly, step by step, at the stage of the

Sutra 14: If the fire of citi descends to the [lower] stage, it burns to a certain degree, despite the covering, the fuel of the knowledge-object. 

Citi, truly, is a fire, because it is able to devour the (phenomenal] universe. If it descends to the

The intention [in the choice) of the expression to a certain degree is [to convey] that when (citi) devours [the matter of the universe] it does not consume [it] altogether but makes [it] to rise [anew] through the part made up of the sainskaras. And that all knowledge-subjects do possess (such power of] devouring [objects] is proven by one's own experi ence.

___Sutra 15: In seizing the power, it makes the universe its own. 

Citi is power—[citi] which causes the covering of body, life and the other [physical constituents] to immerge and, [by so doing], itself emerges and, 

[further], manifests its true nature. As is said : 

After the mantras have taken possession of this power.194

And thus, it makes the universe from the earth to Sadasiva its own. That is to say, [citi] displays (the universe) in virtue of its identity with its own nature. In seizing the power means by relying upon its true emerged nature. This the old masters uttered in the Kramasutras which are composed of their own words : 

As a fire set ablaze burns the fuel-thus one should consume 

the fetters of the objects of sense. 

True, here it looks as if (citi) appeared temporarily only, due to the emerging and immerging of the body and the other Iphysical constituents]. Nevertheless, one ought not to say, there fore : How is this (citi)-if it does appear only temporarily-to be understood as one whose essence consists in appropriating the universe and is derived froni samāves'a ? 

In reality, (matters are like this): Inasmuch as the body and the other (physical constituents) emerge, being brought into appari. tion by the sovereign will of citi, there is, we must adinit, only a temporary appearance. However, (citi) shines forth always and otherwise [than through it] the body and the other [physical consti. tuents] do not shine forth.प्रत्यभिज्ञाहृदयम्

[The oneness with cit] constitutes salvation in one's life-time, which is, salvation of a living person who still retains his vital breaths.

How now does the attainment of spirit and bliss come to pass ? Reflecting on this problem he said: 

Sutra 17 : By opening the centre !*2.4x there comes to pass the attainment of spirit and bliss. 

The centre is nothing else than the exalted sainvid "" because it is present as that which is inner most in the universe and because no (entity] possesses a true nature except when attached to its screen.** However, in the maya stage, (sainvid) has, in spite of this its character, concealed its true nature and has taken possession of the stage of pranasakti "Xin support of which we may cite the saying : 

At first satiivid, it has transformed itself into princ. [And lastly], resting while descending in the stage of buddhi, the body and the other (spheres of manifesta tion,'' samvid] has followed the course of the thousands of nadis.

Although so constituted, the real nature of (samvid) remains, nevertheless, hid from the pass. But if, during the Yoga procedure alluded to there bursts open the exalted sainvid which, as the innermost of the universe, forms the centre, then there comes to pass the attainment, that is to say, the getting, of spirit and bliss the nature of which has been described. Hence the above-mentionell salvation in one's lifetime. [The same takes place) if, in the course of [the method referred to above] which will be dealt with [below],

Herein, that is, when the central s'akti is opening, are disappearance of vikalpa and the other [expedi ents] the means. The opening of sainvid, which forms the centre of the universe, is accomplished by following the authorship of the fivefold process, etc. [as] taught above. This is the substance of what has [already] been expounded.

However, there is still another means mentioned. Shattering the foundation of all fetters by means of breath-control, bondage by the mudras it and the other [methods], one gains access to happiness. Within a short time (the Yoginį reaches the state of samāvesa which unfolds itself and becomes accessible, being conditioned by turya and turyatita.186 [He succeeds in doing so] when, 

. [1] by means of the Yoga method alluded to, he is keeping citta directed on the heart; 

[2] by becoming liberated from all sorrow what soever, he is banishing vikalpa which impedes cheer fulness; 

[3] in virtue of seizing avikalpa," he is absorbed in contemplating his own citpramaty-ship untarnished by the body and the other Iphysical constituents). 

Thus it is said in the excellent Pratyabhijña : 

In giving up vikalpa and concentrating on one [only], one 

reaches gradually the stage of is'vara-ship.

Contraction of sakti is concentration, through pro gressive drawing in, of the [sakti) that rushes through the gate of the senses. As is said in the Atharva Upanishads, in the kathavalli, in the first mantra of the fourth creeper* :

repose in the eternal. 

The unfolding of sakti, 24 that is to say, of the one hidden within, [results] from sudden bursting of all the circles of the organs." To quote: 

[This unfolding] is perceptible within [and is characterized] 

as looking outward without closing or opening of the

From opening of the centre results attainment of spirit and bliss, and this is nothing else but the samadhi of the highest Yogin, for which we have as alternative terms besides others samavesia and samapatti. With reference to the Yoga-method for producing the permanency (of samadhi), he said : 

Sutra 19 : In vyutthanasr which shows the after-effects of samadhi one approaches more and more permanent samadhi through meditating on one's 

identity with cit. 

Just like one intoxicated, staggering from joy under the impression of the savor of samadhi, the true Yogin who has attained samaves'a will, even in vyutthana, behold the [whole] mass of entities dissolve in the

[He will, further), devote himself more and more to introspection, will-during nimilanasamadhi 8-meditate on his identity with cit and thus come to find pleasure on samadhi alone even in the [otherwise) agreeable span of vyutthana. Thus, it is said in the Kramasūtras : 

Having attained samāves'a he becomes an accomplisher by 

means of the kraniamudrā "19 that is characterized by 

inwardness, in spite of his outward gaze. In virtue of ūves'a"" there takes place in this (mudrā) first 

a penetration from the external into the internal, (then) a penetration from the internal into the real nature of the external. Thus, this mudrākrama is connected with the external and the internal at one and the same time. 

The meaning of this quotation is as follows. In mudra the Yogin concentrates successively on the spheres * of consciousness relative to emanation, 

* Really, 'circles.'

stabilitating and re-absorption. That is to say, 'by means of kramamudra' he makes that which dwells within himself [really] his own (by knowing it). That is nothing other than cita-s'arti which manifests itself in turiya (Kramamudra has the character] ' of inward ness,' that is, its nature is characterized as a perfect self (ahanta).*3 Thus, he attains samaves'a'' in spite of his outward gaze **in other words, although he is busying himself with the sense-objects, the unfolding of the highest s'akti becomes for him an immediate reality and he [himself) becomes 'an accomplisher,' i.e., a Yogin of the highest type. 

In this process, moreover, there occurs through progressive devouring 'the penetration', i.e., sarnīves'a 'from the external' 'into the internal' which is, inter preted, from out of the totality of sense-objects that is being devoured into the stage of the highest citi. 

Furthermore, through avesa,' i.e., by dint of samaves'a [and] due to vamana the penetration' is

[2] because it puts the fetters to fight (dra); and 

[3] because it locks (mudray) the universe within, that is, in the reality of turiya. But krama it is called

It is presupposed that lasting samadhi has been attained. Here now we are concerned with the self (ahanta), that is, the genuine camatkara'' of (one's] own nature.

Furthermore, the sadasiva-isvara-ship in which the self-conceit 11 of limitation--which conditions the body and the other physical constituents—has faded away and whose body is the universe, is the essence of these (subjects of consciousness). And, finally, the highest reality of that (sadasiva-isvara-ship) is the blissful great Lord himself consisting as he does of the camatkara of the entire universe which becomes manifested through the [divine] light, the only reality [in existence]. For, nothing may become manifest except it enter into the real [divine] light. 

And the highest Lord * lets bliss Aow without bounds because, due to his perfection, he is free from all desire after having brought it to pass that in what ever is alive there is bliss. [All living things, to be sure), are made up of nothing else but the objects and subjects of the [eternal] word. 167 Since sovereignty of the will constitutes his inmost nature, that (highest

[To wit, the uni verse becomes tranquil when, by the Yogin, it has really] been appropriated at heart in the manner of pratyahara 226 by forming a cup 227 of both sounds, a and ha, after it has flashed as the bindu 25 that sub sists in the consciousness of unity. Such is the true meditation made up of the throng of sounds. As is 

written :

universe is impeded (thereby). (Likewise they speak of it as) sovereignty of the will, primary 

doership and isvara-ship. 

Again, this self (ahanta) represents the stage of the great power because all mantras proceed from and come to rest in it and because it calls forth, by means of these (mantras), activity with any object whatever [as aim]. This has been said in the excellent Spanda in the passage beginning : 

After the mantras have taken possession of this power .... and closing by saying : 

... those who walk in the law of Shiva.

In the Sivasūtras also we read : 

Being intent on mahalırado *one becomes conscious of 

mantra-power-Ureşa 1, sitra 22. 

Here, then, penetrating into the perfect self (ahanta) which, in essence, is the great mantra-power, is nothing else than the process by which one becomes this (perfect self). [It takes place] in virtue of the immersion of the body, life and the other [physical constituents] by being confident that one will reach the stage (of the perfect self) and thus immersing in its savor 67 the body and the other [physical constituents), indeed, even the blue with its co-ordinate factors. For, whatever extends, is known for certain, is stored in 

memory or is desired-[whether it be] the body, pleasure, the blue and so forth--throughout it all the manifestation that consists in the exalted citi s'akti shows itself represented as a screen.36 Is it not said :

True, (citi-sakti) becomes manifested only in this way [i.e., as a screen]. But, due to self-conceit-which, conditioned [logically] by its maya-s'akti, is being effected [empirically] through that obscuration which is a result of the appearance of the body, the blue and the other [physical constituents)-it seems as if (citi s'akti) were of a differentiated nature altogether. 

For that reason also (citi-s'akti) is being looked upon as [differentiated] by the maya-subjects just because these latter are made up of knowledge, will, resolution and the other (psychical functions of limited subjects]. In reality, however, citi-s'akti is one only. As is said : 

And this reflection, strewn with the (eternally) alternating 

individual concepts, is nothing other than The great Lord, the [highest] knowledge-subject that consists 

of changeless, infinite spirit.

arguments, And, hence, incapable of understanding the _____doctrine of recognizing the Lord [within]. For these has been given this instruction in the 

truth. 

Concluded is the Pratyabhijñahrdaya. 

The Composition is the work of the blissful teaches Rājānaka kşemarāja who has depended on the lotus-feet ** of the blissful Abhinavagupta, the best among the venerable great Shivaite teachers.NOTES 

1. Pratyabhijñā (i.e., ' recognition ') is the doctrine which leads a person to become aware again of the fact that the individual soul (pas'u or jiva) is identical with the universal Soul (pati, Shiva, Isvara, etc.). The word is employed to designate the Kashmirian form of Shivaism, particularly the religious philosophical system for which Kashmir Shivaism is noted. The system appears under this name in Madhava's Sarvadars'anasangraha as the eighth among the sixteen systems mentioned. In this work it is distinguish ed from the rest of Shivaite systems, viz., Nakulis'apās'upata dars'ana, Shaivadarslana and Rases'varadars'ana. 

Other designations of the same system are Trika and Spanda (erroneously distinguished from Pratyabhijñā by Bühler in Detailed Report of a Tour 21 Search of Skt. MSS., 1877, and still so by Winternitz, Geschichte der Indischen Literatur, 3 B. p. 445. Cf. Chatterji, K. Sh, p. 7 and Iyengar, Sh$V., 36). For further designations of the system consult Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 1 f. 

2. Shiva's five kriyas (t.e, transactions, functions, deeds) are characteristic of a doctrine propounded also by the Shivaism of the Tamil South (cf., eg. Schomerus, H. M., notes 16 and 20). The doctrine is met with likewise in the Shaiva-section of the Sarvadars'anasangraha (cf. Deussen, G. Phi”, 1, III, p. 317), The krtyas are the following: 

(a) Srști = ejection, emanation. Creation is the usual 

but inexact translation. (6) Sthiti = stabilitating, maintenance. 

102 

THE PRATYABHIJNAHRDAYA 

(c) Samhāra or samhrti - drawing back in, reabsorption. 

Usually rendered by destruction, which is incorrect. (d) Vilaya=disappearance, concealment. (e) Anugraha=dispensation of grace. 

The first four krtyas constitute the cosmic process, lasting and repeating itself as it does from eternity to eternity. Shiva sends forth the universe out of himself, imparts existence to it, and draws it back again into himself so as to have it appear once more after a period of concealment (i.e., universal rest). Such a cycle is called kalpa. 

On a different plane lies the fifth krtya. It is the act of grace by which Shiva works the salvation in the human being. The discrepancy between this kriya and the first four krtyas appears less great if we bear in mind that the soteriological accom panies also the four other conceptions which are more of a cosmolo gical kind. Of this later on. 

3. Sarikara Upanishad does not refer to a work of the Upanishadic literature, bat signifies secret doctrine (cf. Deussen, G. Ph. 1, II, p. 11 ff.). A footnote to Kşemarāja, ShSV., 6, 3 explains 'siva-upanişad by 'siva rahasya-āgama-s'āstra,' i.e., 'the doctrine that is contained in the Shivaite secret tradition' (cf. ib., 50, 12). Sarkara, meaning propitious, is a surname of Shiva. Consequently, sarkara-upanişad and s'iva-upanişad are synonyms. 

4. In kşemena, that is, securely, luckily, we recognize a play on the word. Kșemarāja thereby alludes to himself as the author of the work. Or should we, perhaps, regard the expression as an ab breviation of Kşemarāja ? Then we would have to translate:'... The best is brought forth by Kșemarāja.' The readings of the codices ka, kha and ga would harmonize with this interpretation because they employ the active form : 'From out of the ocean . . I bring forth.' 

5. Samāves a means coalescence or unification with some thing. Here it is the coalescence or, rather, the knowledge of the identity of the universal Soul and the individual soul (see note 1), 

ic 

30. 

NOTES 

103 

and of subject and object at the same time. The soul becomes aware that it is nothing else than Shiva himself and that the universe is his, or, its body. Such knowledge constitutes the salvation of the soul. On p. 45b samāves'a is interpreted by samāpatti, i.e., coincidence, and samādhi. Here, as in other Indian systems, the latter expression denotes retreat, the highest stage of Yoga. 

6. In s'aktipāta or s'aktinipāta (both meaning fall or descent of the power), Shiva's s'akti descends-his power', i.e., his creative energy which, in reality, is not different from himself. It is thought of as female and represents his immanent aspect. With it he permeates the universe, actuates the cosmic processes and, in s'aktipāta, descends upon the soul, taking possession of it. All said and done, s'aktipāta is the same as anugraha (see note 2); cf. Barnett, P. Abh., commentary to stanza where the commentator, Yogamuni, furnishes also a valuable description of the effects of s'aktipāta. 

7. Citi (i.e., intelligence, spirit) is Shiva in the form of absolute intelligence, absolute comprehending reason. Synonyms are cit and caitanya. In our text, the former is promiscuously used for citi; the latter, however, appears only in citations. 

8. The 3rd person seems to permit the conclusion that Ksemarāja is only the author of the commentary, but not of the sītras. In the Catalogus Catalogorum 2 (1896) Aufrecht mentions our text under the title of Isvarapratyabhijñāhrdaya, ' a Commen. tary on 20 sätras of an unknown author by Kșemarāja.' The editors of the text credit Kşemarāja also with the sūtras (cf. Short Review, 6, and Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 39). Nevertheless, the 3rd person of the verb alone does not constitute a sufficient proof. It is possible that, originally, the author of the commentary may have been a different person from the one who wrote the săītras. But after the sūtra stile had become predominant in philosophic litera ture it frequently happened that the philosophic author himself explained inore in detail the doctrine which he had formulated in condensed aphorisms. Thus it may have been the case that our author retained this time-honored form of the verb employed as an 

104 

THE PRATYABHIJÑÄHRDAYA 

introduction to the sutras, be it as a stereotyped formula or be it for the sake of a fiction. 

With respect to the situation here one might see an indi cation of sūtras and commentaries being by different authors in that several sūtras contain not one but two or three explanations. The same holds true in some of the Shivasutras by Vasugupta which Kșemarāja has commented. Different explanations presuppose doubts in regard to the original sense of the sūtra which would be superfluous had the commentator composed them himself. Cf. note 28. 

9. Svatantra, really 'that which has itself as foundation.' Thus it comes to mean not-presupposing-anything, absolute and, finally, free, of sovereign will. 

10. The term siddhi (ie, reaching the destination, being accomplished, perfected here includes both systi and sarhāra. Cf. note 2. 

11. The tattvas (singular : tattva; meaning 'suchness' or principle), thirty-six in number, are the entities into which Shiva, as the universe, differentiates himself in systi. The concept has been taken over frorn the Sätikhya. The latter recognizes twenty-five tattvas which have been transferred unchanged by the Trika system, but have then been supplemented by eleven more. Ascending from the prakrti and from puruşa as the highest principles of the Sārkhya, to Shivatattva, the highest of the Trika, the tattvas are the following: 

(a) Five principles connected with the limitations of the subject. They are called kañcukas because they cover like 

sheaths' the knowing subject, hirider and limit it in its activity and thus allow Shiva to become puruşa. They are : 

i. Kāla, i.e., time, the limitation in respect of duration 

(tattva No. 26). ii. Niyati, i.e., restraint, restriction, the limitation in 

respect of spacial expansion (tattva No. 27). iii. Rāga, i.e., inclination, the limitation in respect 

of interest (tattva No. 28). 

NOTES 

105 

iv. Vidyā, i.e., knowledge, the limitation in respect 

of knowing tattva No. 29). 1. Kalā, i.e., art, the linitation in respect of author. 

ship or efficacy Itattva No. 30). 

(6) Māyā, as the universally limiting principle superior to the five kañcukas (tattva No. 31]. (Māyā is also understood as the sixth kañcuka ; so Abhinavagupta, P. Y., 17, 24; Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 75). 

(c) Five principles of the all comprehending unlimited subject-object. They are : 

i. Vidyā, i.e., knowledge, in contradistinction to 

the kancıka of like name, called usually also s'uddhavidya, ie, pure knowledge (tattva 

No. 321. ii. Isvara, i.e. Lord (trativa No. 33). iii. Sadāsiva, .e., ever benevolent' (tattva No. 34). 

(The last tied terms testify to the fact that popular names for Shiya have found their way 

into the philosophic mainenclature). iv. Sakti (see note 6) [rattun No. 35). 

v. Shiva (tattri No. 361 

On the meaning of these five highest principles and their mutual demarcation Chatterji, K. Sh., pp. 51-53 and 61.75 gives astute information, 

True, there are only 34 principles from sadāsiva to the earth (bhiimi or kşiti, the first and lowest principle which represents the solid bodies and, being farthest removed from Shiva, the greatest materialization). In this passage the author has the development of the universe begin with the 34th principle, since he deems the two highest tattvas, sakti and Shiva, too far removed from the process of the world. Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 65, n. 1 adduces some more passages from other texts in support of this contention. 

12. The universe is not created, but emerges from where it has been potentially. Cf. note 2. 

106 

THE PRATYABHIJNAHRDAYA 

13. The world-rest between samhāra and srsti (cf. note 2) is meant. 

14. The term pramāts, i.e., the measuring one, signifies the subject of knowledge. The highest pramāt, is Paramasiva, 'the highest Shiva.' 

15. Here, the sakti defined in note 6 is called parās akti, ' the highest sakti, to distinguish it from its innumerable subsidiary saktis by means of which it permeates the universe and causes everything, salvation and bondage, good and evil. 

16. 'Bhațțāraka' is an honorable surname of gods and eminent human personages. As we see on p. 8a, Sivabhattāraka is distinguished from Paramasiva. 

17. Meant is the enchained Sout. In the same sense the S'vetās'vatara Upanishad 4, 9 speaks of the other.' 

18. Māyā (cf. note 11, ativa No. 31) or māyā-sakti is the power which, like all other principles, emanates from the sakti of Shiva. It brings the subject of knowledge under limitation through the five kañcukas (cf. note 11, tattva Nos. 26-30) and substitutes for the luminous consciousness of identity the dark illusion of separation. 

19. The term prakrti, otherwise of no importance in our text (the word appears only here in reference to the Trika) refers, according to Chatterji, K. Sh., pp. 50 and 87 ff., to the limited object. Together with the limited subject, puru:a, it becomes manifested under the influence of māyā and its kañcukas. 

20. The objection is raised from the point of view of the Vedānta. 

21. Pramāna, i.e., measure, denotes the means of knowledge. 

22. Prameya, i.e., that which is to be measured, signifies the object of knowledge. Cf. note 14. 

23. The editors of the present text comment in a footnote very pointedly on this passage, making use of the following simile : 'When the sun shines forth there is no need of another light.' Consciousness is the ultimate, that which cannot be proven further, It requires no higher evidence since it encompasses all proof. 

NOTES 

.107 

24. This work appears in Ksemarāja, ShSV. under the name of Trikahrdaya. 

25. The word kalā has many meanings. In this place it does not possess the common meaning (cf. note 11, tattva No. 30). With the adjunct baindavı (derived from bindu, i.c., the spark situated in the mystic central cavity of the human microcosm and identical with Shiva) it must signify as much as Sivatattva. Kșemarāja, ShSV., 78, 5, employs kalā (i.e., particle) in the sense of tattva. In the fourth appendix to our text baindavi-kalā is defined as svātantryas'akti (i.e., sakti of absoluteness). This is fundamentally in harmony with our interpretation. Iyengar, ShSV., 247, translates in the citation given in this work also the two words by 'ray of the moon.' In a footnote he says by way of explana tion: The ray of the moon, de consciousness, asserts itself in the very attempt to disprove it, it is an ultimate fact.' Cf. note 32. 

26. The term rasya, 1.8, the savory or palatable, stands for the whole phenomenal world. One sensation represents all. 

27. The siddhis (singular siddhi, meaning achievement, success, perfection, magic power) are the powers and boons that are being lavished upon the Yogin who is on the road to the highest goal which consists in salvation, a passage from the Svacchanda belonging to the Āgama literature (cf. note 128) and cited by Kşemarāja, ShSV., 125, 1-3 may illustrate this point: 'He strikes terror into Brahman, Vişņu and Indra, the gods who rule over the perfect ones, over demons and serpents—and he liberates them therefrom. He blesses and curses them. The pride of death he lays low, even the mountains he causes to tumble.' However, in the passage of our text, the idea of salvation is included in the concept siddhis. In the narrower sense of the term, the latter are designated by bhoga, that is, enjoyment. 

28. Introduced by 'api ca' we face another explanation of the first sõitra. The author employs other conjunctions besides this one, as 'atha ca' and 'kini ca', for the same purpose ; cf. p. 19b and Kșemarāja, ShSV., 7, 2 and 8, 7. 

108 

THE PRATYABHIJÑAHRDAYA 

29. Nila (i.e., blue, the blue color) is representative of all external sensations. Cf. rasya in note 26. 

30. Of all inner sensations sukha, pleasure, is representative. Cf. notes 26 and 29. 

31. Prāņa (i.., breath, breath of life, life) indicates animal soul life. 

32. Different from the first explanation, the universe here is thought of merely as the object which is composed of the consti tuents just mentioned. 

33. Āvesa is the same as samāves'a ; cf. note 5. 

34. Kşemarāja, ShSV., 37, 10 f. also cites the verse and adds the significant words : From being attentive to the vanishing of the difference between subject and objecr he derives bliss which consists in divine wonder. That is tijc beatitude of his samādhi.' Cf. note 5. 

35. 'And so forth ' (Sanskrit ain) must refer to form ; consult P. 3a. 

36. Here and in the following satra we have a polemic against the Bhedavāda or the Dyaitadars'ana. This is the doctrine of two principles, the Indian dualism, which asserts the non-identity of subject and object, or of the universal and the individual souls. For the genesis of the philosophic movement in Kashmir as well as for the development of the system the opposition to the Dvaita was of determining significance." 

Vasugupta, the founder of the Kashmirian Shivaism, received a revelation from Shiva. Legend has it (cf. Iyengar, ShSV., 243-4) that in this act of grace Shiva was led by his resolve not to have the tradition of the secret knowledge cut off in the world that had fallen prey to the doctrine of Dvaita. 

In this connection we mnight make mention of the tradition according to which Sankara in his travels came near Kashmir. The activity of this greatest of India's monists falls into the first half of the ninth century and comes, therefore, at the same time as the appearance of Vasugupta (cf. Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 23). Hence it is not improbable that he imparted the impetus to the monistic movement in Kashmir (cf. Farquhar, O.R.L.I., p. 198). 

NOTES

However, it is difficult to determine which rival system our author may have had particularly in mind--whether the Sārkhya proper or the Vis'istādvaita or other Shivaite systems professing a stricter dualism. According to Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 8 ff., the Saivāgamas taught in reality a dualism and the Sivasūtras were revealed exactly for the purpose of dispelling the error of dualism and establishing the truth of monism. The Saivāgamas are Shivaite works which the followers of the Trika uphold as authoritative and interpret monistically. 

37. There is a distinction between upādāna, i.e., causa materialis and nimitta, i.e., causa efficiens. Cf. Garbe, S., p. 293, 

38. In the Indian silhouette play, bhitti is the screen upon which the silhouettes of the figures appear being set in motion by one single player behind the screen. The light is thrown on to the screen from the stage. Shiva is compared with the player, the world process with the play of the figures which he handles. The Sārkhya also knows this simile; cf. Deussen, G. Ph.', p. 449 and 460 (Sātikhyakārikā 42: natavat: 59: nartakı). For further elaborations of this simile cf. Ksemarāja, ShSV., 89, 5 ff. and in connection with it the footnote on p. 377 of Iyengar, ShSV. It is easy to understand that one chose images and comparisons from the field of theatricals in connection with a God who appears in the sacred legend mainly as the great dancer ; consult also Schomerus. H. M., note 20 : Shiva as dancer ; Yogamuni on Paramārthasāra, 1 and 5: Shiva as actor. Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 45 paraphrases 'svabhittau' (i.e., 'on its own wall ') with 'in Himself as the basis of the universe.' 

39. This is another simile in vogue among these philosophers because it supports the point of view of Advaita (monism). Cf. Barnett, P. Abh., pp. 721 and 723, and Bhandarkar, V. S., p. 129. 

40. The term avasthita denotes that which is in a certain avasthā or avasthāna, that is, condition. What appears as the universe is nothing but an avasthā of Shiva. See Barnett, P. Abh., p. 728, stanza 26 : 'As syrup, molasses, jaggery, sugarballs, candy, 

110 

THE PRATYABHIJÑĀHRDAYA 

etc. are all alike juice of the sugar cane so the divers conditions (avasthā) are all of s'ambhu, the Supreme Self.' 

Consult also note 7 on p. 6 of our text: 'From the Agama literature we know seven primātars as subjects (grāhaka). They are: (1) Shiva ; (2) the mantramahesvaras ; (3) the inan tresvaras ; (4) the mantras ; (5) the Vijñānākalas ; (6) the pralayākalas ; (7) the sakalas,' Cf. notes 44, 46, 47, 50, 52-7. 

41. The manifoldness of the universe comes about in the following way. When, in the evolutionary process, Shiva as pramāty descends stage by stage—here seven or eight-he suffers greater and greater limitation. There corresponds in each stage to the more or less limited primair belonging to it a just as limited prameya. The world is, as wide or as narrow as the mind that contemplates it. To this we must add that not merely in the highest, but also in every other stage pramāts, and prameya, are in reality regarded as identical, 

42. The terrn aucitya pieans being accustomed, or habit. The thinkers who chose this tern for the relation of subject and object must have had an inkling of our present knowledge that the organs develop in their contact with and adjustment to the peculiarities of external stimuli, k 

43. If, viewing one's own psychological existence as a whole, one says: 'I am this,' one identifies the self (ahantā) and the 'this' (idantā), but at the same time differentiates them also. For, now it is the 'I' that is predominant in consciousness, and then it is the 'this. The same holds true with Shiva and the universe, with pramāty and prameya, in the various stages. Consult Chatterji's lucid explanations in K. Sh., p. 61 ff. 

In the stage of Sadāsiva the 'this' becomes subordinated to the self in the consciousness of the pramāts. See Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 67 and Barnett, P. Abh., p. 724, the commentary to stanza 14. 

44. Already in this stage, Shiva does no longer appear as one pramātę, but as many pramātars. They are under the leadership of Sadãs'iva and are called mantramahesvaras (i.e., great LordsNOTES 

of the mantras), superhuman beings like the Rishis. They are, presumably, a product of popular Shivaism in which the magic formula (mantra) plays an important rôle. 

45. Here, self and 'this' are perfectly balanced, one against the other (cf. note 43). The 'this ', according to Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 69 ff., is dominating over the self in this stage, while in the following only the balance is observed. We grant that syntactically the 'this 'precedes the self in our passage. 

46. Confer note 44. That they belong to a lower stage is indicated by the omission of the epithet mahat, meaning great. 

47. Confer notes 44 and 46. They are also called vidyesva ras (Barnett, P. Abh., p. 724). 

48. Presumably, the same is applicable to Anantabhattāraka (i.e., 'the infinitely great Lord') as we remarked already in note 11 in the case of Sadāsiva. 

49. The term sākhë (e. branch) applies to a school of phi. losophers or to the followers of a guru (1.., teacher). The latter whispers the mantra of his säkha into the ear of the student when he is being initiated. The mantra constitutes the initiation formula. 

50. The phases of mantras, mantresvaras and matramahes. varas designate so many stations which the Yogin on his path to salvation has to go through. Confer Kşemarāja, ShSV., 124, 9 f.: 'When, by stages, the worth (and power) of the mantras, mantres'. varas and mantramahesvaras is attained, there springs up the capacity for another creation, that is to say, one becomes the architect of (a universe) to be modelled according to one's own wishes.' 

51. The concept sāra (i.e., nucleus) corresponds to our potentiality in this case. The nucleus of a being is its potentiality, or, what may become of it. 

52. He who rid himself of the organs (kalā) by means of knowledge is called vijñānākala. Kalā here is used in a third meaning to be kept distinct from the two other meanings (cf. notes 11 and 25). The term refers to the organs by which the soul is 

112 

THE PRATYABHIJNĀHRDAYA 

fettered to the world or by which it clings to the world. Whether our system, like that of the Pas'upata sect (cf. Bhandarkar, V. Sh., 122), understands by it all tattvas from 1 to 23 remains obscure though it seems probable. 

There is no unanimity among the texts as to the classifi cation of the Vijñānākalas in the hierarchy of the different pramātars. On the authority of Barnett, P. Abl., p. 724 (com mentary to stanza 14) the concept vijñānākala comprises all of the three classes named above, viz., inantramahes varas, mantres varas and mantras. Though it seems as if our passage in question separates the vijñānūkalas from these classes it may be due merely to the somewhat obscure way of stating it. That Kșemarāja shares the view of Abhinavaguptas his teacher, which was just stated, is plain from the passage on p. 12a. 

53. This qualification is due to the doctrine of the three malas. Mala ineans dirt, soiled garment. This mala dulls the individual soul and keeps it from recognizing its identity with Shiva. One distinguishes the following malas : 

(a) Ānavamala is the primary mala (mülamala) on which depend the following two kinds. This āņavamala is that species of malu which transforing the soul into an anu (i.e., atom, a small, limited and, hence, individual entity). It is the evil of individuation. 

(6) Māyāmala (i.e., the mala of māyā) is the mala that gives to the soul its bodily form. 

(c) Kārmaniala (i.e., the mala of action) is the mala which enchains the soul by good and evil action. In one word, kūrmamala is karma (cf. Bhandarkar, V. S., 130). 

In our passage the vijñānākalas are said to be such as are free from the third mala, at least in as far as they do not accuinulate any new karma. But in this matter also there is no unanimity. See Barnett, P. Abh., p. 724, where the vijñānākalas appear as entirely free from mala 2 and 3, corresponding to their equation with the higher pramātars (cf. note 52). 

NOTES 

113 

54. Our author is of opinion that they still have a connection with the karmia of former existence. The verb pari-ci, i.e., to heap up, is intelligible thus only. 

55. Subordinated to the pralayākalas (see note 56) are the sakalas. Sakala is one who still retains his organs; he is subject to all three malas. 

56. Subordinated to the vijñānākalas are the pralayakalas or pralayakevalins. Pralayākala is one whose organs have been destroyed in the dissolution of the world (pralaya is the same as sarılāra; cf. note 2). We are forced to conclude, however, that these organs have not been destroyed altogether, because they appear again in a new systi. The pralayākalas are pramātars of the void (sünya) because their world is in a state of dissolution. According to Bhandarkar, V. Sh., 125, they are free from mala 2, but bound by mala 1 and 3. 

57. After having discussed previously the evolutionary stages from the mantramahesvaras down to the sakalas, the author now returns to the beginning, concluding this section with an account of the two stages lying above the mantraualesvaras, taking them in their reversed order. Immediately, such an arrangement of the material might seem perplexing. Yot, it may be justified on the ground that these two uppermost stages are to be represented as fundamentally different from all the rest. In fact, they are really no stages of manifestation at all, being eternal in virtue of their remoteness from srsti and sarithāru (cf. note 11). With them, the plurality of pramātars has ceased to exist. Shiva appears as one only, in harmony with his true nature. 

On the lower of the two 'stages' he is called Sivabhattā rakı. But this 'stage' corresponds to what is otherwise known as saktitattva (cf. note 11). See also p. 2b where sakti and Sivabhattāraka are designated as 'not distinct.' 

58. After all, the two eternal principles, Sivatattva and s'aktitattva, are included here, thus bringing the number up to 36. 

59. The verb sphur means to palpitate, be agitated, but also to sparkle, flash. Because of this double meaning the verb is 

15 

114 

THE PRATYABHIJÑĀHRDAYA 

especially adapted to the simile of waking from sleep, illustrating the fundamental cosmological idea of this system. In this respect sphur resembles ud.mil and ud-miş, both of which verbs mean to open one's eyes. Unmil occurs on pp. 1b, 56, 6a, etc.; unmiş on pp. lb, 2b, 40a, etc. When Shiva opens his eyes, the universe unfolds itself. Should he close his eyes, the universe is drawn back in again. Indeed, this is more than a mere simile. The process of the world is nothing else but such an experience of the infinite universal spirit. Cf. the first stanza of Kallața's Spandakārikäs : 'He who causes the world to rise when opening his eyes and causes it to set when closing his eyes--him ... we praise.' 

These psychological analogies to metaphysical doctrines have their immediate foundation in the analysis of sensory ex perience as we find it in connection with the Sārkhya. Consult Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 04. ff, and what he says about buddhi on p. 103. 

60. The highest Shiva, barinosiva, is the more popular designation of the absolute. A 

61. Transcendency and immanency. Paramasiva unfolds himself by the power of his sakli as the universe (immanency). But this is only one aspect of himself in reality, he reaches tar beyond into infinity. 

2 62. The noun cetana is derived from the same root as cit and citi (cf. note 7) and means consciousness, spirit. Elsewhere (cf. Garbe, S., p. 229) it is used synonymously with the two other ternis. Here, however, it is distinct from either and stands for cit when in the condition of limitation. 

63. The process of manifestation sets in with the rise of a polarity between subject and object in that sole reality which had been, up to that time, completely at rest. Subject and object separate and, for the present, the object becomes repressed by negating it. The universe disappears before the eye of the highest praināty (cf. Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 62 ff.). Hence, the void, the absolutely void' (sünyātisinya) which, however, has nothing to do with the 'void' discussed in note 36. 

NOTES 

115 

64. Cit is isolated in as far as during this phase it lacks any object. It is to this situation that the two terms akhyāti (i.e., non consideration) and anāsritasiva (ie., 'Shiva who is attached to nothing ') have reference. 

65. There are 240 worlds (bhuvana) according to Barnett, P. Abh., p. 741. On p. 721 he describes these worlds as 'of various shapes, being round, square, triangular and of the form of crescents and umbrellas.' 

66. According to Barnett, P. Abh., p. 729, bhāva (i.e., entities) are the subjects and objects which go to make up the finite universe. 

67. The word rasa means both, taste and juice, and the passage therefore really reads: 

they distinguish them. selves in that their cit-juice is not dried up.' In this connection we might point to the fact that the gustatory nerve reacts only towards solutions. 

68. In citations taken from Agaunts and Tantras there often appear fenzinine vocatives. This is due to the fact that the doc trines expounded in these works are frequently cast in the form of a dialogue between Shiva and his wife. On Agama cf. note 128, on Tantra note 130. d 

69. The word bhairava, a derivative from bhïru, means horrifying. Generally it refers to Shiva, being a popular name of his. As such it reminds one strongly of his original character as that of the terrible Rudra of the Vedas. The 'three heads' (trisiras)---from which this Agamic work received its namemare in all likelihood an outcome of the religious imagination of the people. (Compare the idea of Shiva's having three eyes). Specula tively, however, these three heads may have been brought in connection with the three fundamental principles of this and other Shivaite systems, viz., pati, pas'u and püs'a. 

70. The two works mentioned above are thus designated as parts of the Āgamic literature. On Āgama see note 128. 

71. This siloka obviously is meant to illustrate the pure nature of cit in symbolizing (khyā) it by light. Light constitutes cit; the negation of light, therefore, amounts to a negation of cit also. 

116 

THE PRATYABHIJÑAHRDAYA 

72. The term jīva (i.e., living being, the individual soul) is synonymous with pasu. 

73. Meant are the works of the Kashmir school in contradis tinction to the Āgamas. On Spanda cf. note 1. 

74. As it stands, this quotation is unintelligible, cut loose as it is from its context. A footnote of the editor may throw some light on it. 'Reflecting on the meaning of non-sensical phrases like “ The embankment wants to tumble down" (one must ask oneself] : how can there be a wish in (such) a soulless embankment ?' Speaking figuratively we attribute will and desire even to lifeless objects. Similarly we ascribe wrongly to jiva what really applies to Paramasiva only. 

75. The concept vikalpa tie, change, diversity, doubt, hesi tating reflection) originated with the Yoga ; cf. Yogasūtra 1, 6, 9, 42 in Deussen, G. Ph., p. 511 ff. According to Barnett, P. Abh., p. 723 (commentary to stanza 11) vikalpa is ' cognition of an object as characterized by differentiation from another (anyāpoha).' To express it more in the phraseology of Yogamuni (cf. Abhinavagupta, P. Y.), the object proper of vikalpa comes to be displaced by another one for its sake. A 

To further clear up this concept it is said in the commen tary to stanza 68 (Barnett, P. Abk., p. 738): The Yogi ... renounces such “ imaginations” (vikalpāḥ) as “ I am a fettered soul, embodied and bound by karma, these children and wife are mine, by this work I shall obtain paradise or hell." Being inspired by the absolute consciousness, he casts such ideas away into the “radiance of the Self” ... and renders himself one with the transcen dental subject .. 

Hence, vikalpa is every thought of the individual soul which draws distinctions, contrary to truth, between the individual objects by bringing some in relation to oneself and excluding others, thus limiting the self. 

76. The term citta (i.e., thought, consciousness, spirit) refers to the organ of thought of the individual soul. Of the same root as cit and cetana (cf. notes 7 and 62) the expression is rather aptly 

NOTES 

117 

chosen in that the common root already suggests an affinity between the principles which these three termini represent. 

According to Kşemarāja, ShSV., 73, 8, the concept citta includes the three inner senses of buddhi, ahamkāra and manas and thus becomes a synonym for antahkarana (inner organ). Of this later on. But according to Schomerus, Sh. S., 138, citta ranks with these three inner senses, being fourth and lowest. This is the theory of the Tamul Shivaism which is thus seen to be in contradiction to the Kashmir system. 

77. By vidyā here is meant the fourth of the five kañcukas (see note 11), the impure knowledge (as'uddhavidyā), in contrast to the s'uddhavidyā mentioned in pote 11. Vidyā is the principle of limitation which compels the individual soul to exclude (cf. note 75) all other objects from vision in order to become thoroughly conscious of one. Therefore, vulvt underlies vikalpa. 

78. For the meaning of saiadhi consult note 5. 

79. The term s'uddha adhvan (1.8., the pure, or, perfect path) designates the sphere of the five highest principles from s'uddhavidyā to Shiva. The pramair-ship of the pure path with its two highest principles extends beyond the pramātı-ship of the vijñānākalas. The concluding words, highest degree ', would indicate this. 

80. For pralayākalas and sakalas consult notes 55 and 56. 

81. These are the three guņas, really, 'strands twisted into a rope.' The conception originated with the Sānkhya. The three gunas represent the three constituents of primary matter ( prakrti): 

(a) Sattva (i.e., goodness) is by nature that quality of things which rouses contentment within us. It is light, not heavy or oppressing, and clarifying. Its purpose is to enlighten. 

. (b) Rajas (i.e., passion) is that quality in things which stirs dissatisfaction within us. It is stimulating and, hence, agile. Its purpose is to urge on. 

(c) Tamas (i.e., darkness) is that quality in things which leaves us in a state of indolence. It is heavy and oppressing, paralyzing our emotions, and generally impeding. To hinder, thus, 

118 

THE PRATYABHIJNĀHRDAYA 

is its purpose. (Thus according to Deussen, G. Ph.', 1, III, p. 428, explanation of Sātkhykārika 13). 

The triad of guņas corresponds to the triad of sukha (i.e., pleasure), duḥkha (i.e., sorrow) and noha (i.e., confusion, delusion). Indeed, they are interchangeable (cf. Abhinavagupta, P. Y., 51, 2). The guņas, or their corresponding psychical elements combine to make up the experience of the pas'u, the individual soul. 

82. Since, as was said before, pati and pas'u are in reality identical, our system has, therefore, to find a corresponding triad for the pati state. Consequently, the system establishes for pati the triad jñāna (i.e., knowledge), kriyā (i.e., activity) and māyā to which little importance is attached elsewhere. 

We are not surprised when māyā is included in the pure sphere of Shiva, because we know that our system reckons besides the ordinary māyā (as'uddhamūra, ie, impure māyā), also with a s'uddhamāyā (ie., a pure maya) which is identical with the highest s'akti of Shiva. 

83. Citi-sakti is a synonym for Shiva-s'akti or, preferably, simply sakti. Cf. notes 6 and 11. 

84. The māyāpramatr is the subject of knowledge of the impure path, in the sphere of limitation. It consists of pralayā kalas and sakalas ; see notes 55-6. 

85. The term pradhāna (ie., basic element) does not in this passage refer to the Sānkhyan much-liked pradhāna, meaning pri mary matter, a synonym for prakyti and avyakta. Rather, it is the material which especially the organ of thought of the individual soul, citta, busies itself about, fashioning its creation—which is the empirical world-out of it. 

86. In the world rest, citta cannot avail itself of the body and of life as a pradhāna for its activities. However, the sains. kāras (i.e., impressions, after-effects) are at its disposal. These are the imprints received in a former existence (in the sakala state ; cf. note 55) due to contact with the world of bodies. Being a part of puryaştaka (cf. note 94), the vehicle of the sainskāras, citta wanders with it from existence to existence. See Kșemarāja, 

NOTES 

119 

ShSV., 73, 8 (commentary to sūtra 1 of the 3rd unmeşa): 'Citta migrates-i.e., goes from womb to womb--being attached to the functions of sattva and the other gunas (cf. note 81), because it is ignorant of the fact that its true nature consists in cit.' 

87. That he should do thus is due to citta. By vyutthita (i.e., really, one who has turned away from something, is distracted) these texts characterize a person who enjoys the ordinary, everyday affairs of the world, has, therefore, an antithetical character to that of a Yogin. The verbal noun, vyutthāna, designates the activity of such a person, which is opposed to samādhi. On this point consult Yogasūtra, 3, 9, 37, in Deussen, G. Ph., pp. 529 and 533. 

88. The text reads mayiyal pramäta.' 

89. These are the 77 stras ascribed to Vasugupta which constitute the foundation of Kasimir Shivaism. 

90. The inherited intellectualism of the Indian doctrines of salvation is rather prominent here. He who does not attain this knowledge of the ātman with all its finally ramified details will not partake of salvation. On the different means of salvation to be found within our system consult note 133. 

91. By their predilection for enumerations our philosophers prove their relation to the followers of the Sārkhya. However, we believe that just this passage shows better than any other that it is by no means a mere passe-temps. If salvation does depend on the correct knowledge of all these details of which none must be for gotten or overlooked, then it is natural, in the interest of the catechumen, to make use of this aid to memory. 

92. Jada (i.e., cold, rigid, soulless) characterizes the purely material, the object of which another may be conscious but which is not conscious itself (cf. Garbe, S., p. 374). 

93. The term svätantrya (nomen abstractum of svatantra, cf. note 9) designates this resolve of Sivabhattāraka to become limited as an act of spontaneity. It is not merely a link in the causal chain : it is a creative act, a primum datum. 

94. The body is frequently compared to a city with nine gates. Here, puryaştaka (i.e., the eightfold in the city) refers, as in the 

120 

THE PRATYABHIJNĀHRDAYA 

other Shivaite systems, to the subtle body, elsewhere called sukṣma. sarira or liviga, the vehicle of the sanskäras (cf. note 86). The puryaştakı is that part of an individual which--unlike the gross body (sthīlusurira)--is not cast uff at death, but migrates from existence to existence, thus guaranteeing the continuity of personal identity throughout the cycle of birtlıs (sarnsära), 

As to what the eight parts of the body are, opinions differ greatly. The fourth Appendix to our text edition gives on p. 69 as an explanation of the term the five tanmātris (ie., elements, or, fine elements) and the three inner senses of manas, charkari and buddhi (cf. note 76). Different explanations offer Mādhava in the Sarvaders'unaSaugraha (cf. Deussen, G. Ph.', 1, III, p. 320 f.) and Iyengar, ShSV, Introduction, p. 42. But they agree with reference to the thres inner senses. 

95. Only 35 principles ate nained here. We could hardly be said to be amiss if we see in this departure a concession to mne motechny. Moreover, it was natural to add to the five times five principles of the Sānkhya two umes five more, instead of eleven. The reduction to 35 principles is easily accomplished by taking māyā not as a separate principle, but as a general concept including 

the five kasicukas. 

96. The expression saptapancakasvabhāva means 'consist ing by nature of seven pentads.' Or, if we force the interpretation of the compound a little we may translate 'consisting by nature of a heptad and a pentad.' Above all, this term has reference to the seven pentads of principles ani' is meant to indicate at the same time that Shiva becomes the seven pramätars on the one hand and, on the other, assumes five aspects. However, these seven classes of prumuturs (cf. note 40) have nothing to do with the seven groups of principles, while the five aspects (cf. note 97) may but loosely be brouglit into relation with the five principles of the pure path; they could never be identified with them. 

97. The following are the five main aspects of the sakti of Shiva and, hence, ultimately of Shiva himself :NOTES 

121 

(a) Citi-sakti (i.e., the power of the spirit); (6) ānanda-s'akti (i.e., the power of bliss) ; (c) icchā-sakti (i.e., the power of will) ; (d) jñāna sakti (i.e., the power of knowledge); (e) kriya-sakti (i.e., the power of action). 

Of these the first manifests itself especially in the principle of Shiva (tattva No. 36), the second in that of S'akti (tattva No. 35) etc. Chatterji, K. Sh., pp. 62-75 endeavors to prove that these relations between the five highest suchnesses and the five main aspects of sakti are founded on fact. But the impression 

remains that they represent two trains of thought that have devel. oped independent of each other and have only later on been brought together, not without arbitrariness and artificialities. 

98. The term akkyäti (ie, non-consideration) is to be distin guished from akhyāti discussed in note 64. In the present passage it is the failure to recognize the true nature of the atman; cf. Barnett, P. Abh., pp. 723, 725, 741, etc. 

99. Shiva causes both, salvation and bondage. The decision rests with man and depends on his knowledge. 

100. Different from its use dealt with in note 2, sthiti (i.e., the standing ') here marks the point at which the philosophic speculation on its way to greater and greater abstractness must ' halt'. Therefore, it is the primary or the principle. 

101. Again a simile borrowed from theatricals ; cf. note 38. This shrewd comparison enables the author to vindicate the relative truth of all systems, even down to materialism, no matter how much they may differ from his own conceptions. Everyone of them has beheld the ātman in one of its impersonations and everyone, there fore, knows part of the truth. True, in order to realize the highest truth one must look behind these masks. It is the conviction of the author that only his school and those likeminded have accom plished that. 

This passage is typical of the characteristic Indian bend towards inclusiveness—sit venia verbo-of the willingness of the 

16 

122 

THE PRATYABHIJNAHRDAYA 

THE PR 

Indians to see and acknowledge behind the different forms of expression the common, basic idea. Keyserling, perhaps, goes too far in his Schöpferische Erkenntnis when he says that the Hindus are always conscious of their philosophemes being but symbols of their meanings, but words for what cannot be expressed in language. Nevertheless, he thereby calls our attention to an essential difference in philosoplıy between the point of view of the Indians and our own. The Indian does not take the philosophical system as such as serious as we do. What he regards as essential is not the system but the fact that its originator or adherent endeavors to find by it the absolute and, hence, salvation. Consequently, the Indian is enabled to hold two logically exclusive points of view ( durs gris ') at one and the same time. Cf. the combination of Sankhya and Vedānta in Bhagavad Gitā and elsewhere, but above all, the recognition of Vais'eșika, Nyāya, Sānkhya, Yoga, Mimämsā and Vedānta as six orthodox systems, despite their rather diverging forms and tendencies. 

102. In what follows the author attempts to demonstrate the correctness of the sūtrais on the systems known to him. As is the usual practice (cf. Mādhaya's Sarvudursanasariigraha), in enu merating them he starts with that doctrine which has the least affilia tions with his own. Then, I ascending higher and higher, he gradually approaches truth, which is attained in his own systein. Remarkable is the unprejudiced way in which our author places the two orthodox systems of Nyāya and Mimäṁsā right after the despised Cārvākas and before the heretic Buddhists and the Mādhyamikas, a variety of the latter. However, we grant, that, generally speaking, the tattva series of the Trika was for him decisive. That is to say, his classification of doctrines depended on the problem as to whether the fundamental principle of any particular system could be identified with a lower or higher tattvar. 

103. On the Cārvākas or materialists--so-called after Cārvāka who was one of the founders of the doctrine---cf. Deussen, G. Ph.', 1, III, p. 194 ff. Whole textbooks have not come down to us. Their literary fragments have been gathered froin quotations by

Hillebrandt, Zur Kenntnis der Indischen Materialisten (Fest. schrift for E. Kuhn). There we can find also this very citation with which Kșemarāja presents us; the characteristic satra is supported by Sankara, Haribhadra and the commentary to the Kusumāñjali. 

104. On the Nyāya, the system of Indian logic and dialectics, cf. the section in Garbe, S. , p. 174 ff. which, though short, gives the essential points. 

105. In regard to the termini technici buddhi, jñāna, etc., we have to bear in mind here and in the following that our author takes them in the sense that fits his system. He does so without concerning himself with what the followers of other systems under stand by them. Thus, budhi is the highest of the three inner senses (cf. note 76), and appears in the series of tattvas as the 23rd principle. It is the power of judgment, a reminiscence from the sphere of pure knowledge. Thus, an organ of the individual soul and a vehicle of universal and abstract ideas, buddhi judges and regulates the concrete objects of experience by measuring them on those normative and universal Idens (cf. Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 106 f). 

106. The term jñānitt here is, of course, to be discriminated from the aspect of sakti (cf. note 97) bearing the same name. In our passage it refers to that kind of knowledge which is common to all living beings, namely, the knowledge that is mediated by the senses (and, hence, is false). Cf. Kşemarāja, ShSV., 11, where the second siitra reads in the form Kşemarāja approves : 'Jñāna is bondage' (see ib., 24, 9 and 125, 12). For the double meaning of jñāna cf. Garbe, s.', p. 371, note 4: his first definition of jñāna paraphrases exactly what our author understands by it: The mechanical functions of knowledge belonging to the inner organs and originating under the influence of the objects.' 

107. This statement concerning the identification of atman with the void as maintained by the Naiyāyikas has its reason in that these philosophers hope to find salvation from savisāra in a state of absolute unconsciousness (cf. Garbe, S.", p. 175). 

124 

THE PRATYABHIJNĀHRDAYA 

108. On the Mimārsū, more correctly Karmamımāmsā, the doctrine which teaches salvation by ritualistic works, cf. Deussen, G. Ph.', 1, III, p. 389 ff. 

109. Upādhi (i.e., appositio) is everything that is related to a thing without really belonging to it or without ever entering any close connection with it (Garbe, s.*, p. 231). 

110. The soul (ātman) is capable of being apprehended directly in the experience of the 'I'. 

111. Saugatas (i.e., followers of Sugata) is an appellation of the Buddhists. Sugata (i.e., one who fared well) is, like Tathāgata, an honoring surname of Siddhārtha Gotama. 

112. Of the various metaphysical systems which-contrary to the master's will--soon sprang up within Buddhism our author may have in view the Kșanikarkida, lue, the doctrine of momentary destruction. The expression inanasamtāna (i.e., continuity of con sciousness) would indicate it. This term is used by the Kṣaṇika vādins to denote a continuous series of conscious experiences. These they think of as points, each of which is connected causally neither with the preceding nor the following one. Only the event of the moment possesses reality. 

113. Srutyanta (ie, end of the sruti) is synonymous with Vedānta (i.e., the end of the Veda), because s'ruti (i.e., hearing)-- as a collective name for all revealed texts—coincides with Veda in the widest sense of the word. Yet, our author does not mean the Vedāntins when he speaks of knowers of the Srutyanta. Rather, he thinks of knowers of the Upanishads in general in accordance with the original meaning of Vedānta. 

114. The term prāņa (i.c., wind, breath, life) appears re peatedly in the Upanishads as the fundamental principle (cf. Deussen, G. Ph.', 1, II, Index). 

115. By Brahmavādins (i.e., advocates of the Brahma doctrine) we have to understand likewise philosophers who base their teachings on the Veda. 

116. The specification of non-being' (abhāva) shows that we have to do with those Brahınavādins who hold that the world 

NOTES 

125 

sprang up from non-being (asat). For the Vedic speculations concerning being and non-being, sat and asat, as the world-ground, consult Deussen, G, Ph.', 1, II, p. 117 ff, and Geldner, Der Rigveda in Auswahl, Kommentar, p. 207 ff. These Brahmavādins, our author remarks rightfully, recognize the primary principle in the void (sünya), that is to say, in what the empiricist, but not the metaphysician, regards as void. 

117. On the Mādhyamikas, the followers of Madhyamaka (i.e., the system of the middle path) who represent a philosophic movement within Northern Buddhism, cf. the article by L. de la Vallée Poussin in the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics. According to this authority, these philosophers deny not only the reality of the individual (pudgalm), as do the textbooks of the Päli canon, but also that of mental phenoménia (dharmas). Moreover, they negate not only the existence of suffering beings, but also that of the inflicted pain. Al is void. To eliminate the dharmas associated with the 'thirst" is, in their opinion, possible for him only who has realized their radica) irreality. 

118. On the Pāñcarätias or Bhāgavatas cf, Deussen, G. Ph.', 1, I, p. 62; G. Phi', 1, Ill, pp. 36, 259. ff.; Bhandarkar, V. Sh., p. 38 ff.; Garbe, S.", pp. 63 and 165. The derivation of the name Pāñcarātras is doubtful. It means of five nights and may have originally referred to a festival lasting five nights, or, five days. 

119. Here we have to do with the three padārthas (i.e., main concepts, categories) of the system. Consult Mādhava, S.D.S., p. 45, where praksti appears as acit (i.e., 'absence of spirit ') or drsya (i.e., the visible), Vāsudeva as Îs'vara (i.e., Lord) and the individual souls (jivas) as citas (i.e., spirits). 

The designation of the individual souls as sparks of the Exalted One must be compared with the ancient simile of the wheel of fire (alātacakra); cf. Deussen, G. Ph.', 1, II, p. 212. 

120. In spite of the proximity of the terminus praksti, pariņāma cannot be taken in the technical sense of the Sānkhya, i.e., as meaning 'constant change, but, rather, 'finally,' 'lastly.' The latter is the common signification when at the beginning of a 

126 

THE PRATYABHIJNAHRDAYA 

compound. There is no reason why the author should use the technical concept in this connection. On the other hand, our translation here is well adapted to the context. For, the Pāñcarā tras themselves and the common interpretation of the system as well tell us that the fundamental principle is not prakrti, but Vasudeva. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how our author would fortify his contention of the primacy of praksti. 

121. The term avyakta (i.e., the unmanifest) is a name for praksti, primary matter, having been taken over from the Sānkhya. 

122. On the Sārkhyas consult Garbe, S.”; Oldenberg, U. B., pp. 206-258; Deussen, G. Ph., 1, III, pp. 408-506. 

123. See note 52 with reference to the Vijñānākalas. Our author identifies them here with the puruşas of the Sāňkhya. The latter are the souls who have freed themselves by means of viveka. jñāna (i.e., discriminating knowledge) froin prakṣti and are, there fore, liberated. 

124. Cf. note 113. 125. Cf. note 116. For 7s vara consult note 11. 

126. The Vaiyākaranas are the advocates of vyäkarana, linguistic analysis or grammar. Their doctrine, likewise, makes for salvation and is esteemed highly by Madhava and our author as well. Judging by the position, which the Vaiyākaranas occupy here in Kșemarāja's enumeration (cf. note 102), they must, in the latter's opinion, come very near the truth. For the doctrine of the Vaiyākarañas consult Deussen, G. Phi, 1, III, p. 398 ff.; also Abegg, Sphoța and E. W. K. 

127. The Sabdabrahman, the Brahman of the word, is that phase of the revelation of the deity in which it appears as the eternal word (of the Veda). Being a fundamental conception of the Vyākarana (cf. Deussen and Abegg, I. c.), our author rightly brings it in connection with pasyanti, the Trika concept. For, Vyakarana distinguishes two forms of manifestation in the one, eternal Brahman. These are the sun and substance of all objects on the one hand, and the totality of the words that have reference to these objects (sabdabrahman) on the other. The Trika, 

NOTES 

127 

similarly, differentiates two forms in paramasiva : from all time the universe of objects has been in him potentially and, likewise, the universe of the thoughts and words yet unuttered. This last one is called purā vāc), the highest (word). It appears as pasyanti {vāc), the 'seeing' [word] when the universe is still in the first stages of its development. Being the divine view of the whole universe in its undifferentiated form, pusyanti must yet lie beyond all experience. But, by means of madhyımä (vūc), the middle (word). it becomes veikhari (vāc), empirical speech (see Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 3 ff.). According to Chatterji, ib., p. 4, note 2, in a commentary to the Alaskära-Kaustubha, vaikhuri is derived from khra or khru, i.e., nose, or, rather, vocal organ. Though untenable philologically, this speculation, nevertheless, throws light on the Indian conception of vaikhari. 

For sadāsiva sec notes 13 and 14. A passage in Pūrņa ānanda's Şat-cakra-uiridana (eiteil lig Barnett in Grierson and Barnett, L. V., p. 14) bears on the relation of sudiisiva to vāc. Sudāsiver is said to live in akasů, that is, in the ether or empty space. On the close relation of ukusa and s'abda or vāc consult Chatterji, K. Sh., pp. 131.4 

128. The Saivāganas, or, Agamus, kat' efoxvv represent a group of literature that still remains little known. The name Äguma signifies a doctrine which has been transmitted uninter ruptedly from one generation to the other (cf. Bühler, ZDAG, 36, p. 653). Buddhists and Jains also employ the nanie for certain portions of their sacred literature. Winternitz, G.I.L., 3, does not make mention of the Āgamas. 

That much is certain, that they are writings which have been placed by some Shivaite sects beside or, in practice, above the Vedas even as their authoritative religious texts. Farquhar, O.R.L.I., p. 191, names as such the Sanskrit School of Sairn Siddhanta, the Tamul Shivaites, the Kashmir Shivaites and the Virasaivas. This group must be distinguished from the following one which rejects the Āgamus: the Pās'upatas, the Lakulislapās'upatas, the Kāpālikas, Nāthas, Goraksanāthis and Rases'varas. 

128 

THE PRATYABHIJNAHRDAYA 

They enumerate 28 Āgamas. According to Schomerus, Sh.S., p. 14, they are divided into two groups: ten Āgamas of a higher and eighteen of a lower origin. To these must be added a great number of so-called Upāgamas, i.e., auxiliary texts. 

Schomerus, Sh. S., p. 15 says : 'Every Āgama is said to consist of four parts, called kāņda : vidyäkānda, or jñārakānda, yogakānda, kriyūkāņda and caryākānda. They say, the jñāna. kāņda leads to the knowledge of God and yogakānda to the concen tration of the mind upon an object. The kriyäkānda supplies informa tion concerning all functions necessary for consecrating an image of the deity, beginning with the digging preliminary to laying of the foundation. The caryākāıda teaches the method of worshipping.' 

Of immediate value to us here is one of the statements by Iyengar, Outlines, p. 156 ff. concerning the contents of the Āgamas : 'Shivashakti ... is the cause of the bondage of all beings and also of their release. She is the eternal Word, the subtle link between concept and utterance. To this is attached the whole doctrine of mantras. The theory of the existence of a system of Yogic nerves and circles in the body is taught' (cited according to Farquhar, O.R.L.I., p. 195). With this is to be compared the discussion in note 201. V 

lez According to Chatterji, K. Sh., pp. 8 and 10, the Āgamas contain a dualistic doctrine or at least have been interpreted in a dualistic or pluralistic sense before Vasugupta established the Kashmir School of Shivaism. 

Opinions differ widely as to the age of the Saivāgamas. Farquhar, O. R. L. I., p. 194, thir:ks they are of recent origin and places them, however very provisionally, into the seventh or eighth century A.D. Schomerus, Sh. S., p. 12, on the other hand, believes he is justified in saying that at least the beginnings of the Agama literature reach back to pre-Christian times. And, from the archaic meters, words and forms, V. V. Ramanan (according to Schomerus, 1.c.) draws the conclusion that the Saivägamas are not later than the first Buddhist council. Confer besides Farquhar, O.R.L.I., Index, also v. Glasenapp, H., p. 201 ff. 

NOTES 

129 

129. By ärhatas (i.c., the dignified) our author means the Jains. For information about them the article by Hermann Jacobi in the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics may be consulted. In metaphysics the Jains maintain the eternal existence of matter which consists of atoms. All things are made up of the manifold combinations which these atoms enter. The atoms are not constant by nature, but are subject to change or development which consists in that the atoms assume different qualities (gunas). 

130. The Tantrikas profess the doctrines laid down in the Tantras. Since the Tantras are the textbooks of the Sāktas, Tantrikas and S'āktas must, therefore, be identical. Originally, tantra means weaving-loom, then warp and, finally, foundation, norm, rule. Only very recently has the Tantra literature become better known through the publications of othur Avalon (pseudonym for J. C. Woodroffe). The Pretras are very closely allied to the Āgamic literature discussed above. That the limits between the two are not sharply drawn may be seen already from the fact that the names of both are often huised promiscuously. Indeed, at times their identity is asserted {cl. Schomerus, Sh. S., p. 16, and Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 7 ff.). 

Like in the Agimas, in the Tantras also four kandas (see note 128) are differentiatest What is given by Farquhar, (. R. L. I., p. 200, as the contents of the Tantras coincides strikingly with the contents of those parts of our text which deal mainly with the concepts of sakti, mantrus, rüdis and cakrus. See note 201 and Introduction, Section VII. 

According to the passage of our text, the Tāntrikas believe in a transcendent ātman. For the Sāktas, consult Alacnicol, 1. Thu, p. 180 f. 

131. Only the Saiviigamas can be meant here by texts teaching the immanency of the ūtman, as our author says. They are called ümnāya here, which is a synonym for Āgama. 

132. Differing from both, Tântrikas and the followers of Shivaism, the Trika teaches the transcendency as well as immanency of the atman. Cf. note 61.

THE PRATYABHIJNĀHRDAYA 

133. Should knowledge—as a means to salvation—not have been granted, there remains still the possibility of becoming liberated by the grace of Shiva (see note 6) who, from his own free choice (svātantrya), grants it to whomever he may choose. Though, according to Barnett, P. Abh., pp. 719 and 746, grace is a mere factor within salvation by knowledge, in our passage it is a way of salvation independent of and side by side with it. The way of grace, we grant, is like a foreign element in a system otherwise thoroughly philosophically oriented, being mentioned occasionally and in passing only. It is one of those outspoken theistic elements which come to the foreground more in the Shivaism of the Tamul South than in the Shivaism of Kashmir. Confer the central importance of the dispensation of grace in the hynins of Mānikka Vāsāga (Schomerus, H. 1). 

134. Cf. Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 146. 

135. The three following quotations are meant to merely sub. stantiate the last sentence. They have nothing to do with the enumeration of the systems as such, 

136. Desire always causes bondage. Salvation presupposes freedom from all desire, even the wish to be liberated. 

137. A second explanation with a totally different aim is added to the first interpretation of the sätra (cf. note 28). First, the interpreter enlarged upon the principles of the various philosophical systems, and now he is concerned with the psychological conditions of the Yogin. This bifurcation in the interpretation of one and the same sutra is conditioned by dars'ana and sthiti, which terms allow of a variety of explanations. 

In the beginning, dars'ana was taken in the sense of * system' which, though secondary, inay however be thought of first in a philosophical treatise. But here, darsana is understood in its original meaning of 'seeing' which, however, is further developed into that of ' perception' in general. 

Here as in the first explanation, sthiti is used in a sense that comes close to the original meaning of 'coming-to-a-stop.' Yet, here it does not mean the stop put to any philosophical speculationNOTES 

131 

(cf. note 100), but coming-to-a-standstill’and, hence,' cessation' (visrānti), in particular the cessation of the external perception in the consciousness within when it has achieved the identity of the perceived object with the perceiving subject. 

138. For this translation which, of necessity, is more of the nature of a paraphrase see Barnett, P. Abh., p. 722 verse 10 with commentary. 

139. In everyone of these sthitis Shiva reveals himself to the Yogin. The simile of the impersonations or rôles would, however, fit better the first interpretation of the sūtra-a supposition borne out by the fact that the first explanation rather than the second one portrays the thought of the author of the sutra (cf. note 8). 

140. The 'fourth' (turiya or turya) condition of the soul, as the highest condition of püre spirituality, follows the three condi. tions of waking (jāgrat), dreamsleep (svapna) and dreamless deep sleep (suşupti). In our system, however, turiya appears personified in female form as the high Ladyan aspect of the manifestation of parās'akti. But what is more significant, turīya occurs in closest relation with the following three krtyas (cf. note 2): emanation, stabilitating and re-absorption. This is in harmony with the commentary on ShSV., siitra 38 of the third unmeşa where turīya is said to be the source of all these three krtyas. Having become one with the world-spirit in turiya, the Yogin accomplishes the creation of the universe no less than its stabilita ting and destruction (cf. note 50). The concept turīya which, originally, was purely psychological, is here psychological and cosmological at one and the same time. Moreover, in this place clearer than elsewhere, there comes to the foreground the idea that knowledge and existence are identical-an idea which is fundamental not solely to our system but to others as well. 

141. Cf. sūtra 7. 

142. Instead of avaleha (i.e., ‘licking ') which our text has and which is meaningless we prefer the reading of kha : avahela, from the root hid (middle), meaning ' being careless, reckless.' 

132 

THE PRATYABHIJNAHRDAYA 

143. A final remark, no less deep than beautiful : what we care for moves and takes possession of us. 

144. A saisarin is one who is subject to samsára. 

145. Cf. note 76. The concept is taken over from the Sankhya and coincides in general in regard to its meaning with the terininus as the Sankhya uses it. On buddhi, aharkära and manas confer the copious and shrewd observations of Chatterji in 

K. Sh., pp. 93-117. 

146. Also this concept has been taken over by the Trika from the Sārklıya. There are five senses of perception, called buddhindriyas or jñānendriyas. In proper sequence they are : 

(a) The sense of hearing (staranendriya); (6) The sense of touching (sparsendriya); (c) The sense of seeing (larsanendriya); (d) The sense of lasting trasanendriya); 

(e) The sense of smelling (hranendriya). Cf. Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 117 

147. This concept too originates from the Sārkhya. There are, likewise, five senses of action, called karmendriyas. In proper order they are : 

(a) The ability to speak (vac, really' voice '); (b) The ability to grasp (hasta, really' hand '); (c) The ability to move about (pada, really 'foot '); (d) The ability to evacuate (payu, really 'anus '); 

(e) The ability to enjoy sexually (upastha, really ‘lap '). 

Cf. Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 117 ff. 

148. The good no less than the evil deed is karmamala (see note 53). Anil, vice versa, there springs as little disadvantage for the perfect soul from an evil deed als from a good one. Essentially like all Indian religious philosophies our system is ethically neutral. Everything depends on kr.owledge alone. Very character. istic in this respect is the 70th stanza in Abhinavagupta's P. Y., which reads : 

NOTES 

133 

A hundred thousand horse-sacrifices he offers up, Brahman murder he commits a hundred thousand times. With thought on highest truth, untouched by merit or blame, he 

remains unstained. 

The horse-sacrifice is the most meritorious deed, the murder of a Brahman the most heinous one, according to the old Brahınanic view. 

149. The exact correspondence between these five s'aktis and the five kañcukas starting with kalıi, etc., ought to be noted. One will then be enabled to make the latter (cf. note 11) more precise in their meaning. 

150. 'The monism of the Lord' is the author's designation of his own system. Confer note 36. 

151. The term suddhetaradhiyat means the path that is different from the pure one, called also as'uddhādhiva, i.e., the impure path. To distinguish it from the pure path (see note 79), it characterizes the sphere of tlie 31 lower suchnesses from mīyā to the earth which are the principles of the limited subject-object. 

152. The author attempts to discover the five cosmic processes (see note 2) in five psychological ones, however not without force and scholastic artificialities. The fourth point which he makes remains entirely obscure, and none of the three readings supplies a satisfactory meaning. The one we selected is the reading of codex ka. 

153. This work by our author has been preserved and has likewise been edited in the Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies. 

154. The term Māhes varya means ' being a great Lord' and is a nomen abstractum of mahesvara, the great Lord,' i.e., Shiva. It denotes the state of the perfected soul in which the latter is conscious of its identity with Shiva. 

155. The concept jivanmukta, i.e., liberated during lifetime, is met with elsewhere also 

156. This sentence defies adequate interpretation. Perhaps, we are to bring it in relation with a remark in the concluding section of the commentary on the last sūtra which is to the effect that one should always busy oneself with the ātman, being firmly 

134 

THE PRATYABHIJNAHRDAYA 

determined and thus excluding every activity that may have a different aim. 

157. The psychological interpretation of the five processes begun in the commentary to the last sūtra is continued here. 

158. The macrocosmic emanation is identical with the micro cosmic process by which the world of sense appears due to the perceptual processes of seeing, hearing, etc. The forces (s'aktis, cf. note 15) which are at work in perception are called goddesses - a concession to the popular polytheism. 

159. To the macrocosmic phase of 'stabilitating' there corresponds the psychological state of a natural delight in the phenomenal world. The cause of the existence of this world is the pleasure which we find in it, 

The change of the subject here is necessitated by the context, though it is not expressed formally in the text. 

160. To the macrocosmic re absorption there corresponds the psychological experience of the Yogin when, in his meditation, the empirical universe is vanishing. The word vimarś'ıı means really 'touching ', then investigating, scrutinizing, reflecting. We have rendered it by 'meditation, Iccording to Kșemarāja, ShSV., 116, 14, it is the experience of the Yogin by which he acquires knowledge of the true nature of his own self ; ib, 120, 4 we read that it consists in turya (see note 140) and camatkāra. This latter expression is peculiar and offers an opportunity for studying the inner experience of the Yogin. It means 'to cry “camat", that is, to exclaim with astonishment. Thus, the word describes the moment of ecstasy when the Yogin is becoming enlightened. 

161. 'The mountain of manifoldness' is the error which makes us differentiate between subject and object, between the all-soul and the individual soul. 

162. This quotation whose origin the editors of our text consider uncertain breathes a different spirit from our system. Loving devotion (bhakti) in this stanza contrasts with samādhi ('retreat ') which elsewhere (see note 5) is regarded as a means of salvation. The 'you' sounds altogether too theistic for our 

NOTES 

135 

system; for here we ultimately have to transcend the 'you' in order to reach the pure I'. The stanza might come from a text of the Shivaite Bhakti movement, if not from a Vishņuite text. Presumably, it was quoted by Kişemarāja just on account of the verb paramars (from the same root as vimarśa) which is used in it. About the Shivabhakti consult Macnicol, 1. Th., p. 160 ff. 

163. To the macrocosinic concealment (vilaya) which takes place in the phase of the world rest there corresponds the state of the individual soul which-though experiencing re-absorption in virtue of vimarś'a-has, nevertheless, not yet reached ultimate liberation. The sasirskāras keep the soul in sasisāra by producing a germ or seed (bija) for a future existence. Although the sariis. kūras may have been neutralized wyliya for a time.-take it as a cosmic or a psychic event - they resuine their activity at once in a new sưsti and create new sunsard. The Yoga (listinguishes between two kinds of samadhi. First, the sablja-samādhi (i.e., the samādhi that is still burdaned with hijas), so-called because the dispositions (sarıskaras) still continue to have an influence in it; secondly, the nirbija-samadhi (1.2, the samādhi that is free from bijas), so-called because all dispositions have disappeared therein. On this doctrine which corresponds exactly to and probably is the foundation of the Trika doctrine developed here, consult Garbe, S. Y., p. 44. 

164. For the change of the subject see note 159. 

165. The fifth krtya, that is, anugrahu or the dispensation of grace (cf. note 2), is strangely referred to in the sūtra by a term which elsewhere applies to the fourth krtya. It is, therefore, natural to assume a corruption of the text of the sõitra. However, anugraha is purely psychological and has really nothing that would correspond to it in the cosmological scheme. Especially at this point one is impressed by the scholastic way of thinking constructively. With the idea of the number five in mind one added a psychological conception, the dispensation of grace, to the four original conceptions of a purely cosmological character, to wit, emanation, stabilitating, reabsorption and concealment which 

1.36 

THE PRATYABHIJNĀHRDAYA 

were only subsequently interpreted psychologically also. Dispen sation of grace can, of course, not be interpreted cosmologically and, hence, it has in the cosmological series really the function of a mere hanger-on. For psychology and soteriology, however, anugraha is most important, for it signifies the final triumph over those four processes of sasisāra which is accomplished in salvation (cf. note 2). 

The following is meant to explain the expressions of hathapāka and alargräsı. Both terms have reference to the ultimate disappearance of all factors leading to further sannsāra. 

The term hathapiika means 'violent cooking' or 'bring ing to maturity persistently, unswervingly.' Perhaps it corresponds to the malaparipäka of the Sarvasiddhanta which Schomerus, Sh. S., p. 282, defines as follows : Jalapuripäka means ... that the influence of anananala upon the soul is suppressed, that it is but loosely connected with the soul like a ripe fruit with the tree ... Liberation through einigrahı or s'aktinipäta immediately follows malaparipaka as it would hathapāka. More over, hatha, the first part of our compound, reminds one strikingly of hathayoga, the designation of the later and more intense and complicated form of Yoga (cf. note 182). 

The term alatigrasa, la devouring plenty', is explained in sūtra 14 and the commentary thereto. 

Both, hathapūka and alanigrāsa, belong to those forma. tions of concepts which indicate a connection between Yoga and the age-old fire-penance (cf. the earliest word for asceticisnı : tapas, i.e., heat, glow). 

166. In this place a bit of ancient, real magic is protruding into our system. The author is conscious of its inferiority. He mentions it, therefore, only by the way and where he dwells at greater length on this part of the old traditional teaching, as in the ShŞV., he places this magic conception as sāktopāya (i.e., that particular means lof salvation) which employs s'akti) after or below sambha. vopāya (i.e., that particular means (of salvation) which has Shiva as norm). The latter, being a philosophic discipline founded on 

NOTES 

137 

knowledge, corresponds to what has thus far been developed in our text. Nevertheless Kşemarāja did not quite want to relinquish any reference to the mantras : tradition had too great an influence. On the other hand, these magic conceptions and practices are very intimately connected with those profound ideas which turn around the eternal word (parāvāc or parāvāks akti) and which we discussed in note 127. 

167. The basis of this form of magic is furnished by the as sumption of a secret correspondence between the saktis of the universe and the sounds of the (Sanskrit) language, or, rather, the letters of the [Sanskrit) alphabet. We may even speak of an identity of s'aktis and sounds and not merely of a correspondence between them. The philosophical reason for this identity is as follows. There are the two highest fornis of Shiva's manifestation (see note 127), parāsakti as the sun total of all objects and parāvāc as the sum total of the corresponding words. As these two are ultimately identical, so also the different saktis which have their origin in parāsakti and forin the world of objects and the individual sounds which have their origin in parāvāc and constitute the world of speech. He who masters all sounds by rightly making use of the mantras (ie, the magic formulas) which are made up of them, is master also of the whole circle of s'aktis and conse quently of the highest sakti as well. In the end, such mastery amounts to the same as having knowledge and leads, therefore, to s'aktipāta and, hence, to salvation. But the mantras as such represent merely a linkage of sounds which are totally ineffective. How they become effective is shown by our author in the ShSV. (cf. Iyengar, ShSV., p. 358 with note and p. 359). 

168. 'Perfect consciousness of the “I” (pīrra-ahan vimarś'a) is the consciousness of the identity of self and universe. The real meaning of vimarś'a is scrutiny, deliberation; cf. the vimarś'ana of p. 246 which we have translated by meditation. The term is rendered by Barnett sometimes reflection', other times “intelligence'; Iyengar translates meditation,' 'discriminative inquiry,'' consciousness.'

THE PRATYABHIJNĀHĶDAYA 

169. The Devanāgari and the other Indian alphabets that are modelled on the same principle really end with the lingual ! and comprise 48 letters. Of these 14 are vowels, 5 gutturals, 5 palatals, 5 linguals, 5 dentals and 5 labials; to these must be added 4 semivowels, 3 sibilants, h and l. Viraņācārya, the author of the Sivajñānapradipikä, Bhojadeva, the author of the Tattva. prakās'ikā, as well as other writers of Agamic literature (cf. Barnett, P. Abh., p. 719, note 1) who develop the same theory mention the sounds or letters from a to !. Our author, however, who is much interested in the number five adds to these letters of the alphabet proper some consonant combinations so as to bring the number of sounds up to 2 times 5 times 5. He adds kşa because it has a sign of its own but what are the others he may be thinking of ? 

In the Shsv. 14, 12 Ksemarāja further mentions 50 entities in which the universe differentiates itself. He then enlarges upon the correspondence between sounds and s'aktis in 60 ff., in the commentary on the seventh sntre, in the second part treating of s'āktopāya (see note 166). The vowels le calls the representatives, of the inner universe, che conson-ints those of the outer, ha the sound of immortality, kşü the germ of life, etc. Furthermore, he constructs mysterious relations between the five original vowels, a, i, 1l, ļ and !, and the five groups of consonants, the gutturals etc.-queer speculations in the spirit of the old Brāhmaṇas. 

170. The opposite of vikalpa; cf. note 75. 

171. In the Indian alphabets the consonant series starts with ka. Consult note 169 for the correspondence between the conso. nants and the outer universe conveyed by the senses. 

172. Brāhmi-otherwise the wife of Brahmā in the Hindu Pantheon--is here one of the powers which depend on parāsakti. She pervades the sensual universe and misleads mankind. Every one of these hierarchically arranged powers again governs a certain class (varga) of s'aktis. On their deification cf. note 158. 

173. At first, this whole passage with its complicated concep tions seems nothing but a mere pastime. However, the meanin". 

NOTES 

139 

is as follows. When, in a state of complete subversion of all relations, the individual soul is succumbing to the illusion of separation then the universal soul experiences most powerfully its identity with the individual soul, because it realizes that all objects that appear in virtue of enianation and 'stabilitating' are one only and that the one is identical with itself (cf. the quotation that follows). Contrariwise, the stage of re-absorption which, for the individual soul, is relatively higher is felt by the universal soul as being relatively lower, just because the object vanishes. 

174. The concept mudrä appears here for the first time in our text. In the main, the preceding discussions are of a philosophical nature. In Yoga-practice nila is an extraordinarily important concept. It means originally a signet-ring, seal, lock. Then it came to be a terminus technicus of the Yoga for postures and gymnastics in connection with and for the furtherance of breathing exercises. The latter are supposed to effect cures of all kinds of bodily ills and, above all, to bring about salvation. 

The Gherandasavitkitu (ed. Bombay, 1895, with an English translation by Sris Chandra Vasu) is an important work on the Yogins. Schmidt, E., p. 193 ff., cites from it 25 different kinds of mudrās which are accurately described and for the most part illustrated. Schmidt reproduces these originals of the Gherandasarhitā which are done in water color by a Yogin and had been acquired by Garbe in 1886 in Benares. For the difficult definition of mudrā the fact may not prove unimportant that in the Gherandasarhitā as well as in the Hathayogapradipikā the terms bandha and bandhana (i.e., bondage : fetters : checking, restraining) appear as alternatives. 

In all probability, the meaning of mudrā which it has in Yoga is connected with the last phase of the above-mentioned semantic development of the term. Thus, mudrā is the 'lock' or protection against the attacks by and influence of the external world. It is accomplished by certain postures and by breath control. Consequently, mudri furthers the ability to master the organ of thought (citta) as well as the attainment of samüdhi. 

140 

THE PRATYABHIJNÄHRDAYA 

On the bhairavamudrā referred to here, cf. note 205 below. 

175. The pure vikalpa' is the psychic function of the un limited subject which corresponds to the vikalpa of the limited subject (see note 75). 

176. The 'outer organ' comprises the five senses of percep tion (cf. note 146) and the five senses of action (cf. note 147). 

177. The four forms of manifestation of the highest sakti are: 

(a) khecari, i.e., 'the one who moves in the sky [khal'; 

(6) gocart, i.e., 'the one who moves in the light-rays.' 

The word go means, besides kine, also star, light-rays. To translate the expression, as is usual, by 'grazed over (by cows)' or similarly is not proper here in view of the fact that gocari appears as a parallel to the three other termisi 

(c) dikcart, iet, the one who moves in space (dis}'; (d) bhūcari, i.e. the one who moves on earth'. 

These names have a touch of mythology. Each one of these four powers, in turn, manifests itself in a hierarchical series of lower s'aktis. As the passage show's, we have to do, of course, with the four spheres of development, viz., the subject of know). edge, the inner organ, the external organ and objective existence, The last mentioned, to be sure, is not something that, as an in dependent object, opposes the knowing subject. Rather, it is but the last phase of the objectification of the knowing process in which the limited subject first becomes conscious of the differentiation by means of the inner organ, next perceives the reality thus conceived by means of the external organs, and, finally, objectifies the per ceived reality or, in other word, attributes existence to the material 

world. 

178. The following detailed description is a little masterpiece which, in its symmetrical construction and minutely worked out parallels is characteristic of this type of thought. Note also the artistic change of the verbs ! 

179. Cf. the commentary on sūtra 9.NOTES 

141 

180. The term cidgaganacari, i.e., 'the one who moves in cit heaven', is an alternative to khecari. With the exception of gocart which in this place creates difficulties in the way of interpretation, these names describe ingeniously the four psychological deities and their sphere of influence. 

181. Certainty of separation (bhedaniscaya), self-conceit (abhimāna) and vikalpana (i.e., vikalpa) are the main functions of the three parts of the inner organ (cf. note 145), that is, of buddhi, ahamkāra and manas respectively. 

182. As the consciousness of the perfected soul is identical with the universal spirit, so is its body identical with the universe which is the manifestation of the universal spirit. For, is not the inner and the outer, spirit and body, in reality one and the same ? The doctrine of Yoga treats this conviction seriously, even to the extent of postula ting a correspondence in detail between macrocosm and microcosm and tracing all essential parts of the world of the Hindus-Ganges and Kailasa, sun, moon, etc. included in the human body. 

The basis of this comparison or equation is not the empirical, but an imaginary anatomy. Furthermore, in following out this idea it has not been the correlations just mentioned which have assumed a practical significance to the Yogin. Rather, it is the complicated system of channels (nace) and cycles (cakra) which are supposed to exist in the human body. A knowledge of these nādis and cakras is indispensable for an understanding of what follows in our text. We explain these things here in their essen tials, because our text does not supply any information concerning them, but presupposes acquaintance with them.

We should add that with the exception of Kșemarāja's work the above quoted texts are all Hathayoga texts. The earliest of them has presumably been composed about two centuries after the Pratyabhijnahrdayı. For, Ksemarāja taught in the first half of the eleventh century, while Goraksanātha is placed by Farquhar, O.R.L.I., § 302 in the beginning of the thirteenth century. The rise of Hathayoga, according to Farquhar, if connected with the name of this Shivaite founder of sects and all later texts on Hathayoga are dependent on him and his works mentioned above. The work bearing the title of 'Hathayoga' seems to have been lost or not found yet (Farquhar, op. cit., p. 254, n. 1), while Gorakşasataka is cited in Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum. 

According to Farquhar, ib., § 423, Svātmārāma Yogindra was a pupil of S'rinātha. The latter he places about 1420 A.D., while the Gheranda-samhitā and the Sivasarihitä he attributes to later times yet; the Șat.cakra-lirūpana (i.e., the treatise on the six cakrus) he does not mention. The Hathayogapradipikä only was directly accessible to me; the Gherandasainhitā I know indirectly through Schmidt, F., the Sivasamhitū and the Șat-cakra. nirupaņa are known to me through Barnett. 

NOTES 

143 

In explaining the doctrine of the nașts and cakras we have to encounter the following difficulty. Nowhere-as far as they have been accessible to me-do the texts of Kashmir Shi vaism discuss these problems in any coherent way. They contain but occasional suggestions. The texts of the Hathayoga, however, contain the doctrine in a form which--though allied to the Kashmirian version of Yoga--deviates not inconsiderably from it; partly it uses a different terminology and has a more complicated system, and partly it assumes even totally different points of view. Perhaps, a deeper insight into this speculative region and a clearer concep tion of the connections between earlier and later forms may be possible after a perusal of the Taníric texts which Arthur Avalon (cf. note 130) has published of recent years. However, this would reach far beyond the scope of the present work. 

Our task, therefore, will be to give only a brief general sketch of the doctrine as it was taught later on in the Hathayoga and afterwards to note the variations which are apparent in the doctrine as taught by Kșemarāja. Such a procedure may, perhaps, lead to a few results not unimportant for the evelutionary history of ideas. 

1. THE DOCTRINE OF NADIS AND CAKRAS 

IN THE TEXTS OF THE HATHAYOGA 

The views of the authors of the above named works on Hathayoga are greatly at variance concerning important parts of the doctrine. Moreover, none of the European interpreters referred to agree with the other. Therefore, we offer here an interpretation which, for reasons of logic, seems to be correct. We cannot, how. ever, discuss at length the reasons which we have for holding different positions or criticise the views of other writers. 

That the function of breath is very intimately connected with that of mind, that voluntary breath-control furthers the develop ment of mysterious powers in man, that, above all, checking of the breath is one of the surest means of checking the organ of thought as it moves restlessly from object to object and thus prolongs forever samsāra--these are ideas which in India reach back to 

144 

THE PRATYABHIJÑAHRDAYA 

hoary antiquity. On such a basis and buttressed by some how ever very inadequate observations on the vascular system in the human body, the Hindus developed the doctrine of the nādis, that is, the ducts and channels through which the breath circulates. 

(a) of the 72,000 nādis which are supposed to penetrate the body in all directions only three are really named and possess a practical significance. There are the two auxiliary nādis, ida and pirigalā, and the central nādi, suşumnā. The auxiliary nādis start in the nasal cavities (iņā in the left one and pingala in the right one) and run parallel to each other through the body. They end in the first cakra, called mīlādhāra (i.e., the place of the root or basis) which is situated between the sexual organ and the anus. However, not the auxiliary dadis alone end in the mülādhāra, but also the suşumnā. The latter leads from the mūlādhāra in or alongside the spinal column (inore than that we are not able to say) to the last and highest çakra through a number of other cakras which are arranged in certain intervals, one above the other. 

The highest cakra, usually called sahasrāra, (i.e., (the wheel) of a thousand spokes), is situated between the eyebrows in the middle of the forehead. According to some it is located in the anterior fontanel. Some texts count six, others seven cakras, mülādhāra and sahasrāra included. They all have a name of their own while their form and color is described with accuracy (although the descriptions vary) and brought in a mysterious relation to the entities of the universe and the world of the gods (sun, moon, ether, Brahmā, Vişnu, Rudra, etc.). 

All cakrus have the form of lotus flowers of which each has a certain number of petals. Mīlādhāra has four, others have six, twelve, etc., sahasrāra a thousand. Of greatest importance are mīlādhāra and sahasrara as the terminations of the suşumnā. The latter enters into the sahasrära through the brahmarandhra (i.e., the opening of brahman), into mūlädhāra through adhovaktra (i.e., the lower mouth). That much for the 'anatomical' part of the doctrine. 

NOTES 

145 

(6) We discuss now the physiology of the doctrine. The ordinary breathing process of inhalation (pūraka) and exhala tion (recaka) travels along the path of the two auxiliary nādīs and allows the organ of thought to remain in its changeableness and fickleness, thus keeping up samsāra. Should we desire to become liberated we must, through breath restraint (prāņāyāma), calm this activity. 

This is being done in the following way. The air which has been introduced into the mīlādhāra by way of the auxiliary nādīs must be retained (kumbhaka) in the mīlādhāra. Then, by means of certain other operations, physical as well as mental-such as pressure on the very spot in question, or fixation of the organ of thought thereon-the air must be forced into the suşumnā. This is no easy matter inasmuch as the adhovaktra, the entrance to the suşumnā, is barred by the kundalini tee, the coiled one, the snake. In later developments of the doctrine of kundalinī, this mysterious being comes to be of greater and greater importance. Coiled up three or eight times, like a snakes it rests over the mīlādhāra. In ordinary human beings it is sleeping. Consequently, when the breath is to reach the stesknina, the busidalini must be awakened. This one may be accomplished by the operations mentioned above. The snake jerks, from its original coiled position it becomes erect and darts into the suşumnā whereby the passage is opened for the breath. It now passes along the suşumnā and arrives, through brahmarandhra, at the sahasrāra. Thereby samādhi is attained. For, sahasrāra stands for the absolute in the microcosm. 

(c) As far as the breathing process is concerned, our description of it doubtless presents a rather unique picture. How ever, when considering the rôle which the kundalini plays in it, we become at once aware of a discrepancy. If, in ordinary human beings, its function consists merely in barring the suşumnā and obstructing the process of salvation, then it seems not plausible why it should not be satisfied with giving free access to breath when Yoga is applied. Instead, it enters into the suşumnā whereby really a new kind of hindrance is created for breath. 

19 

146 

THE PRATYABHIJNĀHRDAYA 

We may, therefore, infer with certainty that we are here again confronted by one of the frequent amalgamations of originally distinct conceptions. Thus we actually find that in other passages of the texts the process of salvation just outlined is superseded by another one. The issue there is not-or, at least not primarily the passing of the breath into the sahasrāra, but the waking of the sleeping kundalini so that it may become united through the suşumnā, with the sahasrāra. For, the kundalini is nothing else but the microcosmic representative of the sakti which creates and permeates the world and which has to be reduced to and united with the absolute, paramasiva. Cf. Schmitz, Psychoanalyse und Yoga, p. 27 ff., whose explanations of kundalini and sahasrāru as symbols of Eros and Logos, their union in consciousness as the sacred nuptials of the niysties, are keen, though perhaps too en thusiastic and, in details, without textual support. 

2. THE VARIATIONS IN THE TYPE OF DOCTRINE AS TAUGHT 

BY KșEMARĀJA IN THE PRAT YABHIJ ÑĀHRDAYA 

(a) Variations in the Terminology. 

In the place of the usual Hathayoga terms we find others in our text. Thus, eda end pingalā are simply called 'the two auxiliary nādīs.' The name suşumna also is unknown. Instead we read about a brahmanādi or madhyaınınādi (i.e., central nādi) or madhyadhāman (i.e., middle seat, place of the centre) or, simply madhya (i.e., centre). Sahasrāra appears, if at all, under the name of agrabhiimi (i.e., place of the apex, or, highest place), mülādlära under that of mīlabhūmi (i.e., place of the root, or, basis). 

(6) Variations in Matters of Fact. 

As far as the doctrine of nūdis is concerned, the most important variation seems to be that the suşuninā is not a duct be it for breath or for the kundalini--leading to sahasrāra, but the microcosmic dwelling place of sarvid or citisakti, the universal consciousness; it is not a passage to a destination, but the destina tion itself. True, the opening of the suşumnā is referred to and 

NOTES 

147 : 

figures also as a means to salvation (' attainment of spirit and bliss '). But the kundalinž does not seem to play any or only a very subordinate rôle. At any rate, no indication nay yet be seen of the commanding significance which it has later on. 

(c) The Doctrine of Cakras (is Taught by Ksemarāja. 

The cakrus require special notice. Though appearing in our text, the term has a meaning quite apart from the later concept, a fact that does not seem unimportant for the historical development of the idea. For, cakra here signifies those four cycles or groups of suktis (explained already in note 177) which represent just as many spheres in which citisakti manifests itself : subject of knowledge, inner organ, outer organ and objective existence. Each of these cycles is subordinated to one of the four forms of the manifestation of the highest sakti which are thought of as more or less independ ent of each other and personitedt 18 goddesses. Thus, the impetus is given to the mythological projection into the macrocosin. On the other hand, one is enabled to project these entities back into the microcosm and localize then in the human body. Of decisive significance, however, is the fact that the cakras are still essentially psychological concepts. 

The genesis of the cakra theory now seems very plain. For the later development of the doctrine other attempts at explanation are more or less justified. H. v. Glasenapp, H., p. 294 ff., discusses Walter's anatomical explanation, Herbert Silberer's psychoanalytical interpretation, Rudolf Steiner's occultistic explanation and Wilhelm Haas' theory of the objectification of sensations. But we can no longer entertain any doubt in regard to the origin of the cakra theory. 

Yet, the objection might be raised that those four cakras mentioned in note 177 need not at all be causally connected with the six or seven cycles of the same nanie, as taught in the later doctrine. Is not the word cakra used for a good many things in Sanskrit ?--On the contrary, we believe that we are able to prove a connection with certainty. As far as the number of cakras is con cerned, we have to admit that an increase of them from four to six 

148 

THE PRATYABHIJNAHRDAYA 

is quite possible for a searching speculation inasmuch as also later on—even in the texts of the Hathayoga--their number Aluctuates still between six and seven. 

The Șat-cakra-nirūpana remarks in 5 ff. (cf. Barnett, Preliminary Note on Yoga, p. 12) that mūlādhära represents the earth (ohti). This is a reminiscence of the fact that mīlūdhura has its origin in bhricaricakra, the lowest of the psychological cycles. The identity of sahasrara and khecaricakra likewise, we believe, is proven by the following circumstances. 

The name khecara (i.e., 'the one who moves in the sky') appears in the later texts only as a designation of one of the most famous mudrās, namely the khecarimudri. Such an ex pression is quite intelligible trithun the conceptual structure of our text. it becomes unintelligibile to the same extent when applied in Hathayoga. Here, theil, we have a proof that khecari originated with the Shivaism of Kashmir. A last trace of the connection may be seen in that khecarimudrü (cf. Walter, H., p. 26, verse 32) requires to bring the rolled up tongue back into the pliaryngeal cašity and to fix the eye on the place between the eyebrows, that is, just the place which the followers of the carry theory recornize as that of sahasriiru. This, we think, demonstrates the identity in the case of the two most important cakras. "* 

More difficult, however, it is to discover gocaricakra and dikcaricakra in later intermediate cakras. Yet, here again we may point to a remark of the Şat-cakra-nirūpana 29 ff. (cf. Barnett, Preliminary Note, p. 14) where visuddha, the third highest cakra, with its 16 petals (the same number of points as the wind rose) represents ūkäsa (i.e., space, air, ether). This reminds one of dikcaricakra of which the element dik or dis means direction, space, quarter of heaven. Perhapis, it is not chance inerely that this relationship should come out most clearly in just this text of the Yoga literature. Is it possible that the Șnt-cakra-nirūpana is older than the three other texts and represents a link between our and the remaining texts ? 

NOTES 

149 

But the most valuable support for our contention we find in a passage from a work entitled Timirodghāta which is cited by Kşemarāja in the ShSV., commentary on the fourth sõitra : 'The ladies of the stations (pithās, i.e., chairs, seats), very grew some, lying in wait between the brahmarandra and the pile of wood holding on to the rope of brahman, deceive again and again.' Shrinivas Iyengar, ShSV., remarks in a footnote : The rope of Brahma, also the rod of Brahma, is the spinal cord, or rather what corresponds to it in the subtle body. It extends from the Brahma randhra, the hole of Brahma, anterior fontanelle, to the citi. Citi, lit. pile of wood for burning, is perhaps the mälädhāra, the sacral plexus (?) where the fire called kendalini is first kindled by processes of Yoga. Between these two extremities of the rod of Brahma there are several stations here called pithas, but more usually cakras. Each is presided over by a goddess, a s'akti ...' 

It is quite obvious that the pithās that lie between brahmarandhra and the pile of wood alongside the rope of brahman (suşumnā, of course) are the same as the later cakras. The pile of wood is a poetic expression for the hre which the later doctrine ascribes to the mūlādhāra, bur which Iyengar-probably incorrect ly-identifies with the kiendalink. The identity of the female powers ruling the cakras with the fout anythological figures which our text mentions is, however, not less perspicuous. Both, indeed, are to deceive the pasu, a function which has its basis in their psychological character. 

. Here we conclude this general excursus. Some of the following notes will supply yet details of the doctrine of nādīs and cakras. 

183. A profound and at the same time illuminating remark. These psychic powers liberate and bind also. He who gains insight into them by acquiring right knowledge of the truth, him they liberate. He who stands face to face with them without having knowledge succumbs to their charm. A more detailed discuss ion of this, their double aspect, follows in the third explanation of the stitra. 

150 

THE PRATYABHIJNĀHĶDAYA 

15t. The term aisvaryasakti is a synonym for parās akti; cf. note 15. 

185. The doctrine of the five priņas (i.e., breaths) reaches back to the time of the Upanishad:s. The pränas are the vehicles of the functions of vegetative life of breathing, blood-circulation, nutrition, secretion and the departure of the soul from the body at death. However, great differences in opinion prevail in regard to details and the functions are variously assigned to the different prāņus. It is quite understandable that while the Sārkhya dropped the prūņas as philosophical concepts, the Yoga retained them in view of the great significance which it imputes to breathing. How. ever, no unanimous opinion is reached. Nevertheless, it is evident that the prūņas, in our texts, la vo reference exclusively to breath ing; they are the different bréatis jassing through the nädis. 

Though genetically connected with each other, prūna meaning 'breath' must not be confused with prāņa meaning ' physical life' which is so often referred to here. On p. 44a prāņa and apāna are called the tivo cabas (it., the moving or flowing ones). They are the two species of breath which in the respiration of ordinary human beings pass through the auxiliary nādis after entering into the nasal cavities. To be specific, prāva belongs to the idä, apāna to the pirigald. 

Nothing is said about samün (i.c., the fused breath). But from the commentary on this passage we gather that it belongs to man while in the pas'u statt. We do not think that we are wholly amiss if we take samün as the fusion of präna and apāna in mülūdhāra. 

About udāna (i.e., the up-going breath) kşemarāja in. forms us in ShSi'., 80, 8 ff., where he says that breath-control brings about the disintegration of prina and cipāna in the fire of udūna which is located in the central wūdi. This is absolutely in harmony with the passage of our text. 

The diffuse or dispersing breath is vyāna. On the authority of the Sivasalita and Gherandasainhita Barnett, (Preliminary Note, p. 13, nole) says vyāna is the breath thatNOTES

circulates through the body. Our passage sees in vyāna and udāna a property of the perfected soul. Its value is considered to lie in that it permeates the universe, the body of the perfected soul. Hence, the conjecture seems justified that vyāna is the breath which, starting from the s14$uinnā which is open to the udāna-in the words of our text, from the centre-permeates the body by way of the 72,000 nāļis. 

186. Cf. note 140. Our system distinguishes five conditions by adding to the four already mentioned turyātītā (i.e., the one that reaches beyond turya). A note appended to our passage by the editor informs very well about the five conditions : The ātman combines with manas, 1ings with the organ of sense, the organ of sense with the object : this relationship between these four (factors) represents the condition of waking. The ātman combines with manas, manas with the object this relationship between the three (factors) represents the state of sleep. The ātman together with the object: this relationship between the two is said to be deep sleep. The ätinatii relation alone is “the fourth " (turya). The condition, however, which is like the ocean with out ruffles is the condition which dies“ beyond the fourth " (turyātīta).' 

187. This sentence gives the neaning of sätra 9, although it is at variance with it as far as the words are concerned. 

188. This might be the lost Vivrti on the Pratyabhijñā kārikās by Utpalācārya ; cf. Chatterji, K. Sh., p. 38. 

189. The word ghata (i.e., jar) is a designation commonly used not only for the human body, but for material things in general ; cf. Garbe, s. , p. 220, with footnotes. See also Para märthasāra 74. 

190. In the case of the pasu, citta is turned outward (bahir mukha) to the world of external things wrongly appearing as the object. The method of salvation requires that citta is turned inward (antarmukha). 

191. He means the kañcuka (cf. note 11). He says 'even' because it is the highest kañcuka and on that account vanishes

last. If it does disappear, then nothing remains of māyā and the 

pure path' is reached. 

192. By Utpaladeva Utpalācārya is meant whom Chatterji, K. Sh., p 4C, assigns to about 900-950 A.D. The quotation comes from the Stotrāvali (i.e., Series of Hymns). 

193. To re-establish the traditional triad, our religious philo sophers have Indra take the place of Shiva whom they have pushed off into the absolute. 

194. These are the introductory words of stanza 26 of the Spandakārikās. 

195. According to the editors of the text, this work is identical with the Pratyabhijñātikā referred to on p. 32a. 

196. Stanza 30 of the Spandukurikas. 

197. The term sariivid is universal consciousness,' a synonym for citi, etc. Cf. the similar ideas advanced in the commentary on sūtra 14 with respect to citi, 

198. In spite of the context in which it appears prāņa here is not one of the five breaths, but physical life. This concept always appears together with that of body (deha). A footnote by the editors corroborates our statement. The footnote reads: 'The meaning is as follows: Just as a king proceeds on foot from his own initiative though he have an abundance of all kinds of vehicles -- so does the lofty sarvid, from its own initiative, take possession of the dwelling-place of the body and the other (physical constituents] whose nature is that of the limited subject of knowledge.' 

199. The author is concerned with the four cakras explained in note 177. The present passage is suited to shed new light on the problem of the cakras. They are the stations (pithās; cf. note 182, final paragraph) in which the citisakti pauses when descending, that is to say, when involved in its progressive process of material ization. Conversely, these stations are reached by the Yogin one by one when he ascends the path that leads by stages to samādhi. By this act of the Yogin the creation is reduced to its absolute state. The cakras mark the stages of the world evolution in the micro cosm. At the same time they serve the Yogin as objects for 

NOTES 

153 

concentration and the fixation of the mind when he reduces the mani. foldness of the phenomenal world to the unity of absolute being. 

The' stage of buddhi' must be identical with the gocari cakra, the sphere in which the inner organ whose three parts are the wellknown buddhi, aharikāra and manas, unfolds itself. 

The 'stage of the body' must be the same as blūcari. cakra, the sphere of objective existence. 

200. According to Gerth van Wijk, Dictionary of Plant names, palāsa is the Butea frondosa, the Dhaktree or kinotree. The midrib of its leaf with its innumerable fine veinlets branching off is supposed to illustrate the shişumnā with the nādis springing from it. At the same time, however, it is, perhaps, meant to ex emplify the lofty samvid as it is seated in the suşumnā and the functions that start from it. 

201. This our author's confession is of extraordinary impor tance for defining the conceptions of the Pratyabhijñā and keeping them apart from the teachings of Tantrism and the Hathayoga, We admit that he merely says that of all the means to open the centre the doctrine of Pratyabhiina knows only of overcoming vikalpa. But this means nothing less than that the whole doctrine of nādis and cakras with its complicated mechanism of breath control, mudrās and the like all of which would tend towards the Hathayoga, does not really belong into the doctrine of recognizing the Lord at all. As the name already clearly suggests, Pratya bhijñā is a way of salvation based on knowledge. Its means are of a purely philosophical and psychological nature. Physiological or even mechanical measures are not needed. 

One comes to be repeatedly under the impression--as was suggested already in note 166--that the author deals with all these things against his better knowledge solely because piety towards the holy books of the ancients requires that he should. He does it on account of their amnāyikatva, that is, canonicity. By amnāya (i.e., tradition, holy text) we have to understand the Saivāgamas. From them are derived those doctrines and methods which-owing to the persistency of tradition-run side by side with 

20 

154 

THE PRATYABHIJNĀHRDAYA 

the Pratyabhijñā. Variously entangled with the literature of Kashmir these teachings emerge later in the Hathayoga where they appear purged of all foreign elements but also assume a more complicated form. 

202. The Katha Upanishad from which the following stanza is taken, belongs really to the black Yajurveda. There is nothing surprising, however, in the fact that a Shivaite text considers this Upanishad as belonging to the Atharvaveda. For, the relationships between this Veda and Shivaism are ancient. The translation of the stanza is based on Hume, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, p. 353, substituting only enjoying' for ' seeking ', because our text has instead of the common reading icchan, asnan, meaning eating, tasting, enjoying. 

203. The beautiful Katha passage just cited illustrates the method of introspection. In contrast with it we have here a looking outward to which the Yogin changes abruptly and which, when accompanied by a right inner attitude, is no less helpful to salvation. For the emanation and re-absorption which the perfected soul accomplishes microcosmically and hence, also macrocosmically in turya consult note 140; for the brigh esteem in which the emanation here referred to is held, cf. note 173.2 

204. Cf. Walter, H., p. 42, 367 

205. Concerning the bhairavamudrā (i. e., “the mudrā of the terrible ") the editors remark : 'The bhairavamudră is identical with the khecarimudrā. Its definition runs as follows: 

The manas firm and fixed without support, Breath firm and fixed without restraint, Sight firm and fixed without a glance This is khecarimudra, the pure. 

:However, this is less a definition of this particular mudrā than an enthusiastic praise of the state of perfection. Our trans lation is only a feeble attempt to reproduce the beauty of the Jagati stanza. 

The Hathayogapradipikā contains a detailed description of the khecari (cf. Walter, H., pp. 26-9 and 43-6). By the way, 

NOTES 

155 

the bhairavanıudrā was mentioned already on p. 28a. About the mudrās in general note 174 ought to be consulted, about khecarı note 182, 2c. Whether the editors are justified in asserting the identity of the later khecart with what Kşemarāja calls bhairava mudrā is, of course, problematic. Among the 25 mudrās described in the Gheraņdasaihitä the bhairavarmudrā figures as little as ainong those mentioned in the Hathayogapradipikā. 

206. This quotation is unintelligible. 

207. The reason is that between the eyebrows lies agrabhūmi (i.e., sahasrāra). Obviously we have to do with a mechanical action which is devised to widen the sahasrāra and thus to aid in the process of salvation as described in note 182, 1. 

208. The fine pränesukti (sfiksmadrānasakti) we have to interpret on the basis of what was said in note 198 where we were really concerned with the ordinary präņas'ıkti or sthūlaprāṇasakti (i.e., the gross prāžas'akti). Commonly we read about a gross and a fine body (cf. e. g., Garbe, s', p. 333 f.), which concepts appear in our text usually in connection with pränt. Correspondingly, we read here about a 'gross' and a fine life. 

209. 'Properly arranging probably refers to leading the kundalini back to its original position in the adhovaktra. 

210. According to the reading of codex gu. The reading 'şaşthavaktraripayām,' i.e., in the form of the sixth mouth ', which the editors incorporated in the text is unintelligible, because in Kșemarāja's system of rādis and cakras (cf. note 182) there appears no other vaktra besides adhovaktra (i.e., 'the lower mouth,' the lower end of the brahmanäại). On the other hand, we are at a loss to understand what function these six mouths should have in the scheme. 

The reading “şaşthacakrariipāni ... Saktim' lie., 'the s'akti in form of the sixth cakra') presupposes six cakras. KŞemarāja knows only of four; this reading of codex kha, there. fore, is of later origin (cf. note 182, 2c). 

211. This puzzling stanza gave the editors occasion to write a rather long footnote which, however, in turn, would require 

y A 

156 

THE PRATYABHIJNĀHRDAYA 

comment. From it we select the following in order to throw some light on the concepts that are involved in it. 

(a) The vahni (i.e., fire) is located in the müla (mūlädhära). This is substantiated by the ShSV. passage and Iyengar's explana tion, both of which we quoted and discussed in note 182, 2c. 

(6) The vişcı (really, 'poison ') is considered the cause of the permeation of the universe. It may have connection with the centre from which radiate the 72,000 nādis; on vyāna cf. note 185. 

(c) The middle between the two on which one is supposed to fix citta is formed by the srstigranthi (i.e., the knot of emana tion) that belongs to the central nādi. Granthi is a concept belonging to the doctrine of dis and cakras. There are three granthis according to the Hatha f'ogapradipikā, eight according to others. They occupy a certain relationship to the cakras and place obstacles in the way of breath or the kundalini when these are trying to reach the sahasrara, at any rate, the granthis must be pierced. However, the essentia) thing therein seems to be that the cutting of these knots produces the so-called 1āda, a mysterious sound which the Yogin perceives in the suşumnä; cf. Walter, H., D. xvii f., and Barnett, Prelimary Note, pp. 11, 15 f. 

(d) Citta is, or is supposed to be, 'isolated 'in as far as it is without any relation to the object of ascending and descending (i.e., emanation and re-absorption). 

(e) ‘Full of vāyu', because permeated by prāna which is characterized by a sudden resounding of the anackakalā. The latter, heard in the central nādi, must be identical with the anacka sounds (mentioned on p. 44a) and refers to a certain kind of the above nrāda. 

() The heatitude of love is higher than the other joys, because it makes one forget all (other) objects. Cf. already Bșhadāraṇyaka Upanishad 4, 3, 21, in Deussen, Sechzig Upani shads des Veda. In that respect it may be compared with the bliss of the liberated soul. 

212. 'Visl vyāptau' is a quotation from the Dhātupatha. 213. That is, citta. 

NOTES 

157 

214. Pankaja is the fower of Nelumbium speciosuni, accord. ing to Gerth van Wyk, Dictionary of Plant names. The flowers close in the evening. 

215. Elsewhere, koti is the bent end of a bow or a similar object. In this connection here it could mean the top and rim of the calotte formed by the cakru lotus. On the cakras as objects of concentration consult note 199. 

216. The expression vailakşanya may only be interpreted as meaning that the Yogin transcends in this manner the ordinary human accomplishments. 

217. At the end of these various instructions for the attain. ment of spirit and bliss we read something the followers of the Yoga must think strange. The ressential thing, we are told, is merely to be blissful no matter what the cause of it may be. Previously, one was concerned with diminishing the activity of manas. Here we read that one may allow naiius to grow, provided it is a source of bliss. 

The view lying at the base of this final passage comes very near that of the Saktas (el. H . Glasenapp, H., p. 395 ff.) and we feel satisfaction that, in realty, our author's thought is not directly in line with it (see note 201). 

218. That is, samadhi which is accompanied by closing (one's eyes). 

219. This inudrä does not figure among the mudrās described in the Hathayogapradipikā, nor in the Gherandasariihitū. The name is explained in the passage itself and in the following commentary. 

220. The same change from the inward to the outward gaze as we met it on p. 41 in the case of the contraction and unfolding of the sakti. Looking outward presents no longer dangers to the one who has become unified. 

221. An example of etymologizing so frequent in Indian texts. For the real meaning of mudrā consult note 174. 

222. The two termini mark both ends of the evolution of the universe and represent parallel expressions to the usual 'from the

THE PRATYABHIJÑAHŞDAYA 

earth to Sadāsiva' (cf. note 11), 'The last kalā' is the highest kañcuka; see note 191. The term kalāgni, however, presents difficulties in the way of interpretation. It means the fire of the Black One, i.e., Shiva ; or the fire of time or of death. One could think of the fire of the microcosin which is believed to reside in mülādhāra (cf. note 182, 2c) and which represents the earth. Still, this leaves kāla unexplained. 

223. According to the reading of codex kha. 

224. The term akula is a designation of the sahasrāra in as far as the latter represents the sphere of absolute being. It con trasts with the sphere of cosmic activity which shows itself in inūlādhara and which is called kula, meaning herd, kin, family. 

225. According to the reading of codex kha and ña. 

226. By pratyāhöra (ie, the drawing back, or, keeping back from) is meant the withdrawing of citta from the elements. Cf. Kșemarāja, ShVS., 81, 10.2 

227. According to the Sanskrit English vocabulary in Lan man's Sanskrit Reader, samputa is a hemispherical bowl or dish. It might have reference to the cakra lotus with its 12 petals. The latter is alluded to on p. 146 and the two koțis that are mentioned there we could, perhaps, identify with the sounds a and ha which form the sarput's the beginning' and 'end of the series of sounds. 

228. The simile of the mahāhrada, (i.e., great lake) for the state of the liberated soul is borrowed from the Yoga and is cited for this occasion from the Yogavāsiştha-Rāmāyana. Kșemarāja, ShSV., 44, commentary, defines mahāhrada as follows: 'When the light of consciousness (samvid), called parābhattārikā, fills the universe ... then it becomes clear, infinite, deep etc. and is called " the deep lake" in consequence.' 

229. That is, the gocari of note 177. 

230. That is, he becames parabhairava, the highest Terrible One (i.e., Shiva). Confer note 69. 

231. This is stanza 51 of the Spandakārikās. In order to understand the following we translate the commentary by the old 

NOTES 

159 

interpreters (text edition of the Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies, vols. 4 and 5): 'But when he has ascended to the One, when he has reached the gross or the subtle, when he allows citta to cling to the gross or the subtle (body)-then he becomes an enjoyer by determining, that is, causing, both setting and rising, dispersion and appearance of it, namely the origin of ideas. Then he will become the cakra lord, that is, he becomes the lord of the universe.' 

In what follows, Kşemarāja explains this stanza differ ently and we believe, more correctly. 

232. Being a nomen abstractum of bhokts, bhoktyta (i.e., the state of enjoying oneself) is a concept interchangeable with pramāts. Cf. note 14. 

233. According to the reading of codex ña, which seems more accurate, syntactically speaking, 

234. The term cakravartui 1.c., ruler of the citi-circles) is here used in a double sense ruler of the cakras and, hence, (in a spiritual sense) ruler of the universe, universal sovereign.' 

235. The reference is to it and 'sivam' at the end of sītra 20. 

236. According to the Indian custom, the pupil places the feet of the teacher upon his head.

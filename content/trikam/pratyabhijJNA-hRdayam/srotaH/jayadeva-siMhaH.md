Swami Lakşamana Joo 

To whom alone I owe Whatever little I know Of Pratyabhijña philosophy 

PREFACE 

Pratyabhijñāhfdayam serves as the best introduction to the Pratyabhijni philosophy of Kashmir. An English translation of the book by Prof. K. F. Leidecker is already avialable. My only apology for bringing out another trans lation of the book is that the one that is available bristles with mistakes, some of which are quite serious. It has been my painful duty to point out a few of the serious mistakes. No one who has not studied this book with a teacher can work away its translation merely with the assistance of a lexicon and grammar. I had the good fortune of studying it with Swami Laksaman Joo who is practically the sole surviving exponent of this systein in Kasumir, im who not only em bodies within himself ile tradition of the school, but has also practised the yogic disciplines recommended by it. He has helped me not only Lyy explaining the technical words but also in tracing out the sources of most of the quotations occuring A in the book. I am deeply grateful to him for his kind help. 

The Sariskrta text adopted is that of the Kashmir Sarisksta scries. The translation is given below cach page of the text. It closely follows the original-with a few words here and there in parenthesis to make the sense clearer. A person knowing even a little of saniisksia can follow the translation almost word for word. I have tried to make the translation as flawless as possible. Some of the highly technical terms have been used in it as they occur in the original, but their connotation has been elaborately cluciclated in the notes. 

An introduction containing the chief features of the Pratyabhijñi system has been provided. An analysis of the contents of each Sutra has also been given. Copious notes on difficult and technical words have been added, and a glossary of the technical terms has also been appended at the end. 

While the book was at the proof stage, I referred my difficulties in some of the Sutras to MM. Dr. Gopinath Kaviraja and profited greatly by his illuminating exposition. I have lised his suggestions with advantage in some of my notes. I am deeply grateful to him for his kind help. Acharya Pandit Rameshwar Jha was helpful in the clarifica tion of some difficult passages of the text. I, therefore, offer him my heart-felt thanks.

Preliminary 

The Saiva religion is perhaps the most ancient faith of the world. Sir John Marshall says in his 'Mohenjo daro and the Indus Civilization that excavations in Mohenjo daro and Harappa reveal an important fact, viz., that Saivism, has a history going back to the Chalcolithic Age or even further still, and that it thus takes its place as the most ancient living faith in the world. It had many off shoots and appeared in different forms in many parts of the world. In India, there are three main forms of this religio. philosophy, viz., the Vira-Saiva form in Deccan-Karnatak, the Saiva Siddhanta in Tamil Nad, and the Advaita Saiva form in Kashmir. There are some common features in all the three, but there are important differences also. Here we are concerned with the Advait Saiva Philosophy of Kashmir 

In India, there is no such thing as arm-chair philosophy. Philosophy is not only a way of thought, but also a way of life in this country. It is not born of idle curiosity, nor is it å mere intellectual game. Every philosophy here is a reli gion, and every religion has its philosophy. The philosopher here was not a tall and spectacled professor dictating his notes to the class or weaving cob-webs of theory in his study, but one who was moved by a deep inner urge to know the secrets of life, who lived laborious days of spiritual discipline and who saw the light by the transformation of his life. Moved by pity for his fellow-men, he tried to interpret the truth he had experienced to the logical reason of man. Thus arose philo sophy in this country. 

The Advait Saiva Philosophy of Kashmir was of this type. For centuries, it was imparted as a secret doctrine to the aspirant who had to live it and test it in the laboratory of the Self. In course of time only the cult and the ritual remained; the philosophical background was forgotten. Perhaps, A 

select few still know the philosophical doctrine by oral tradi tion, but the first thinker known to history, who reduced the main principles to writing was, Vasugupta. He is said to have lived towards the end of the 8th or the beginning of the 9th Century A.D. Since then, philosophical writing had been an active and continued process in Kashmir which went on for nearly four centuries. The literature on this systems has accumulated to such an extent that it would require almost a life-time to study it. Some works of the system have still not been published. 

Saida Literature The literature of the Saiva or Trika system may be broadly divided into three : 

(a) Agama Sastra (6) Spanda Sastra (c) Pratyabhijñā Sastra 

(a) Agama Sastra This is believed to be a revelation and has been handed down from teacher to pupil. Some of the works under this heading are : 

Malini Vijaya, Svacchanda, Vijilāna Bhairava, Mrgendra, Rudra-Yamala, Siva-Sūtras. On the Siva-Sūtras there are the Vrtti, the Vārtika of Bhaskara and Vardharaja and the Vimáršini commentary by Ksema-rāja. There are commen taries on some of the tantras also. 

(b) Spanda Sastra This lays down the important doctrines of the system. The main works under this heading are : 

The Spanda Sütras or the Spanda Kärikäs. These elaborate the principles of the Saiva-Sūtras. On these, there are the following commentaries : 

Vivsti by Ramakantha, Pradipika by Utpala Vaišnava, Spanda Sandoha by Ksemaraja, and Spanda-nirnaya by Kemaraja. 

(c) Praljabkiji Sastra This contains arguments and counter-arguments, dis cussions, and reasonings. This interprets the main doctrines of the system to the logical reason of man. 

Somananda composed Siva-drsi. Another important 

work is Isvara-Pratyabhijña by Utpala, pupil of Somananda. There are the following commentaries on this : 

Vitti by the author himself, Pratyabhijñā-vimarśinī by Abhinavagupta, Pratyabhijñā-vivsti-vimarśinī by Abhinava gupta 

A digest of the Pratyabhijñā-Šāstra, named Pratyabhijña hfdayam was prepared by Ksemarāja. 

Abhinavagupta's Tantraloka in 12 Volumes and his Tanträloka-Sāra give an exhaustive treatment of all the impor tant doctrines and disciplines of the system. 

Pratyabhij Aa-ardayam As said above, this is a digest of the Pratyabhijñā system prepared by Ksemarija. He was the brilliant pupil of Abhinavagupta, a versatile genius who was a peerless master of tantra, yoga, philosophy, poctics, and dramaturgy. According to Dr. K. O. Pandey, Abhinavagupta flourished in the 10th Century A.D. Since Ksemarāja was his pupil, he must have also lived in the 10th Century. He wrote the following works : 

Pratyabhijñáhrdayam, Spandasandoha, Spandani rņaya, Savacchandodyota, Netrodyota, Vijñānabhaira vodyota, Siva-Sūtra-vimarśinī, Stava-cintamani-tika Paraprāvesika, Tattvasandoha. 

Very little is known of the life and parentage of Kemarāja. It has been very rightly said that his book, Pratyabhijña hrdayam occupies the same place in Saiva or Trika literature as Vedantāsāra does in Vedānta. It avoids all polemics and gives in a very succinct form the main tenets of the Pratyabhijnă system. He says at the very outset of his work : 

"इह ये सुकुमारमतयोऋततीषणतर्कशास्त्रपरिश्रमाः शक्तिपातोन्मिषित पारमेश्वरसमावेशाभिलाषिणः कतिचित् भक्तिभाजः तेषामीश्वरमत्यभिज्ञोपदेश तत्वं मनाक् उन्मील्यते ।" 

"In this world, there are some devoted people who are undeveloped in reflection and have not taken pains in study ing difficult works (like Logic and Dialectics), but who never theless aspire after Samäveda with the Highest Lord which 

1. I am indebted to J. C. Chatterji's Kashmir Shaivism for the historical account given above. 

blossoms forth with the descent of Sakti. For their sake the truth of the teachings of Isvara-pratyabhijñā is being explained briefly." 

He regarded Isvara-pratyabhijia of Utpalācārya as a very great work on this system, and has provided a ready and easy manual for those who are inclined as a result of Divine grace to know the main principles of "pratyabhijña', but are unable to study the great work of Utpalācārya, because of their lack of training in Logic and Dialectics. He has succeeded remarkably well in condensing in a short compass all the important principles of Isvara-pratyabhijia and avoided its rigoristic logical discussion. The book is, therefore, of supreme importance for those who want to have an elemen tary knowledge of "pratyabhija'. He has composed the Sutras as well as written the commentary. 

The word "pratyabhija' means re-cognition. The individual Self or jiba is divine or Siva, but he has forgotten his real nature, and is identified with his psycho-physical mechanism. The teaching is meant to enable him to re cognise his real nature, to bring home to him the truth that his real Self is none other than Siva and to suggest to him the spiritual discipline by which he can attain "at-one-ment" with Himn. 

The details of the teaching will be found in the body of the book. Here we may review the main ideas of the system under the following heads : 

1. Ultimate Reality 2. The Universe or the World Process. 3. The Individual Self 4. Bondage 5. Liberation, 

1. Ultimate Reality Reality in its ultimate aspect is Cit or Parāsamvit. Cir or Parasarityit is untranslatable in any other language. Generally it is translated 'consciousness'. I have myself done so for want of a better word. But it should be clearly understood that Cit is not exactly consciousness. The word Cod-sciousness connotes subject-object relation, knower-known duality. But C\# is not relational. It is just the chargelers principle of all changing experience. It is Parasamnvit. It has, so to speak, the immundiary of feeling where neither the 'T', nor the "This" is distinguished. It is the 'coalescence 

into undivided unity of 'I' and 'This'. Perhaps, the word 'sciousness' may, to some extent, express the idea contained in Cit or Parasanivit. To use the verb contained in con sciousness, the Ultimate Reality or Supreme Self is the Self Seiring itself. In the words of Pratyabhijña Sastra, it is, prakasaimararny4. The Supreme Self is called Parama Siva. This is not only prakafa. The word "prakasa' again is untrans latable. Literally,it means light, illumination. Just as light makes every thing visible, even so that being there, every thing else is. In the words of Kathopanişad-Tamed Mäntan anubhari Jarun, tapi bisa garudam pibhati'. 'It shining, every thing happens to shine. By its light alone does all this appear'. Sänkara. Vedānta also calls Ultimate Reality 

prakasa', but the sun is 'prakāfa; even a diamond is 'prakāla'. What is the difference between the two ? The Saiva philo sophy says, "Ultimate Reality is not simply prakara : it is also 

ümarda" What is this ümarfa ? This word again is untransla table. Perhaps the word "Sciring may help. Ultimate Reality is not only Sciousness (prakīša), but . Sciousness that also stres itself (vimarśa). It is not simply pratara lying inert like a diamond, but streys itself. This Sciring or Surveying of itself by Ultimate Reality is called Vintarfa. As Ksemarāja has put it in his Parā-prāvesiká (P-2) it is "akstri māham iti visphuranamn"; it is the ori-relational, immediate awareness of I. What this "akstrima-aham" is, we shall see later on. If Ultimate Reality were merely prakala and not also bitarda, it would be powerless and inert. "Yadi wargümar fau gal anišbaro jadalca prasajyeta" (Park - prāvelika, p. 2) It is this pure I-consciousness or Vimarfa that is responsible for the manifestation, maintenance and reabsorption of the universe. 

Citscires itself as Cidropiri Sakti. This sciring itself as Cidrūpint Sakti is Vintarla. Therefore, virard has been named differently as pardfakti, parduot, Swatantra, aišvara, kardioa, phuratta, Sāra, ardoa, Spanda. (See Parā-prāvesikā by Kacmarāja, p. 2) 

It will thus be seen that the Ultimate Reality is not only Universal Consciousness but also Universal Psychic Energy or Power. This All-inclusive Universal Consciousness is also called Anuttara ie: the Reality than which there is nothing that may 

- 

be called higher-the Highest Reality, the Absolute. It is both transcendental (visvottirga) and immanent (visvamaya). 

The Saiva philosophy has been called Realistic Idealism by some writers. I do not think this is a happy characteri zation of the Saiva philosophy. The approach of the Idealists of the West is entirely different from that of the thinkers of the Saiva philosophy. To characterize it in terms of the Western Idealists is only to create confusion. The word 'idea" has played havoc in Western philosophy, and it would not be right to import that havoc in Saiva philosophy. Ulti mate Reality is not a mere "idea whatever that may mean, but Self underlying all reality, the Changeless Principle of all manifestation. 

2. Manifestation-the Universe-or the World Process. 

Whether we call Ultimate Reality Sciousness or Cons ciousness, it is not something blank. It has infinite powers, and contains in a potential form all that is ever likely to be. It is the Svabled or nature of Ultimate Reality to manifest. If Ultimate Reality did not manifest, it would no longer be consciousness or Self, but something like an object or not-Self. As Abhinavagupta puts it : 

"जस्थास्पदेकरूपेण वपुषां वेन्महेश्वरः महेश्वरत्वं संवित्वं तदत्यक्ष्यद् घटादिवत् ।" 

(Tantr. III Xhn. Verse 100) "If the Highest Reality did not manifest in infinite variety, but remained cooped up within its solid singleness, it would neither be the Highest Power nor Consciousness, but some thing like a jar". 

We have seen that Ultimate Reality or Parama Siva is prakaia-vimarlamaya". In that state the 'I' and the "This" are in an undivided unity. The 'I' is the 'prakasa' aspect, and the "This' or Its consciousness of It as itself is the 'uimarša" aspect. This Vimaria is Swatantra, Absolute will or Satri. This Satli has been called as 'the Heart of the Supreme Lord in Paräprāvesika by Ksemarāja (hrdayam paramesituh). But Sali is only another aspect of the Supreme Self. In the Supreme experience, the so-called "This" is nothing but the Self. There is one Self experiencing Itself. This Vimar or Satii is not contentless. It contains all that is to be. 

यथा न्यग्रोधबीजस्थः शक्तिरूपो महादुमः । तथा हृदयबीजस्पं विश्वमतचराचरम् । 

(quoted by Kemarāja in his Parā-prāvesika) "As the great banyan tree lies only in the form of potency in the seed, even so the entire universe with all the mobile and immobile beings lies as a potency in the heart of the Supreme". Another example that is usually given is that of the peacock. Just as a peacock with all its variegated plumage lies as a mere potency in the plasma of its cgs, even so the entire universe lies in the Sakai of the Supreme. The Sakii of the Supremne is called Giti or pard-fakti or parā-pak. 

Parama Siva has infinite Sakti, but the following five may be considered to be the main ones. 

1. Cit-the power of Sellrevelation by which the Supreme Shines by Himself. In this aspect the Supreme is known as Siva. 

2. Ananda-This is absolute bliss. This is also called Svātantrya-absolute Will which is able to do anything with out any extraneous aid. (Svätántryam ānanda-Saktih : Tantra-Sara-Ahn-1) In this aspect, the Supreme is known as Sakti. In a sense, C and dnanda are the very Sur (nature) 

of the Supreme. The rest may be called His Saktis. 

3. Iccha—the Will to do this or that, to create. In this aspect, He is known as Sada-Siva or Sådākhya. 

4. JÄāna—the power of knowing. In this aspect, He is known as. Isvara. 

5. Kriyathe power of assuming any and every form (Sarvākāra—Yogitvam. Kriya-Saktih : Tantraloka–Sara Ahn. 1) In this aspect, He is known as Sadvidyā or Suddha Vidyā. 

The Universe is nothing but an opening out (unmesa) or expansion (prasara) of the Supreme or rather of the Supreme as Sakti. 

The tattoas of the Uniwersal Experience. We have seen that Param Siva has two aspects, viz., transcendental (Visvottīrna) ind immanent or creative (visvamaya). This creative aspect of Parama Siva is called Siva aftos. 

(1) Siva tartea is the initial creative movement (pra thama spanda) of Parama Siva. As has been said in Sa trimfat-tattva-sandoha : 

पदयमनुत्तरमूतिनिजेच्याखिलमिदं जगत्त्रष्टुम । 

ERR : 44: forum d l Crage 1 verse 1) 

When Anuttara or The Alxolute by His Sudantrya or Absolute Will feels like letting go the Universe contained in Him, the first vibration or throb of this Will is known as Siva. 

(2) Satii tattoa is the Energy of Siva. Sakti in her jääna aspect is the principle of wegation (risedha-wydara-rupa). Satri, at first, megates the "This' or the objective side of experience In Sipa. The state in which objectivity is wgated is called the Very void. In Cit or Pari Samvit, the 'I' and the "This' are in an indistinguishable unity. In Swa tativa, the 'This is withdrawn through the operation of Sakti talla, so that the 

I side of the experience alone remains. This state is called Andria-Sia by Ksemarāja. As he puts it : 

" Tuf....... Ti fa fer-hoffer494144pfa शून्यात्मतमा प्रकाशाभेदेन प्रकाशमानतया स्फुरति ।" - 

Siva in this state appears as a mere 'I' devoid of any objective content. In order that Siva may appear as the Universe, a break in the unitary experience become a nece kary phase. But this is only a passing phase. To the Sub jectivity disengaged from the objective content, the Universe is presented again not as an indistinguishable unity but, an"l-This" in which both are distinguishable but not separable, as they form part of the same Self. 

Sakti polarizes Consciousness into Aham and Idam (I and This)-subject and object: 

Sakti however, is nothing separate from Siva, but is Siva Himself in His creative aspect. She is His Aham-uimarla (I-consciousness), His M ukhatintentness to create. As Mahefvarānanda puts it beautifully in his Mahārthamatt jari (p. 40, Trivendrum Edition). 

स एव विश्वमेषितं ज्ञातुं कर्तुं चोन्मुखो भवन् । शक्तिस्वभावः कषितो हृदयत्रिकोणमधुमांसलोल्लासः ।। 

1. The word 'tattva" is untranslatable. It means the "thatness of a thing. The nearest English word l "principle', 

- 

He (i.c. Siva) Himself full of joy enhanced by the honey of the three corners of his heart, viz., Icchā or Will, Jžāna or Knowledge, Kriyā or action, raising up His face to güze at (His own splendour) is called Sakti". 

Mahesvarānanda explains this further in the following words: 

"यदा स्वदयतिनमुक्तरूपमर्थतत्वं बहिः कर्तुमुन्मुखो भवति तदा ufaf for 2" (p. 40). 

"When He becomes intent to roll out the entire splen- . dour of the Universe that is contained in His heart (in 1 germinal form), he is designated as Sakti". Sakti is, there fore, his intentness to create. 

Sakti is the active or kinetic aspect of Consciousness, 

An idea parallel to Vimarfa or unmukhatā is found in the Chandogya-Upanişad (6, 2, 1-3). 

"सदेव सौम्ब इदमन आसीदेकमेवाद्वितीयम्..... तदक्षत, बहु स्याम्, प्रजायब 

At first (logically, not chronologically) there was only "Sat-all alone without a second. He gazed and bethought to Himself May I be many, may I procreate ! 

This Iesittea or Tipitakarın is parallel to Viwarfa or umukhatā but the implications of this Ikzitakarma have not been developed by Sarkara Vedanta. 

The Saiva philosophy does not conceive of the Supreme as a logomachist but as an Artist. Just is an artist cannot contain his delight within himself, but pours it out into a song, a picture or a poem, even so the Supreme Artist pours out the delightful wonder of His splendour into manifestation or creation. Ksemarāja gives expression to the same idea in his commentary on Utpaladeva's Stotrāvali, 

"आनन्दोच्छरिलता शक्तिः सुजल्यात्मानमारमना" 

Sakti thrown up by delight lets Herself go forth into manifestation". 

All manifestation is, therefore, only a process of experien cing out, creative ideation of Siva. 

In Sakti tattva, dmunda aspect of the Supreme is pre dominant. 

Siva and Sakti faltea can never be disjoined; they remain for ever united whether in creation or dissolution Sivaas the Experiencing Principle, experiencing Himself as purc-'I', and Sakti as profound bliss. Strictly speaking, Siva-Sakti tatta is not an emanation or abhasa, but the Seed of all emanation. 

3. Sada Sina or Sadakhya Tattua The will (Iccha) to affirm the "This' side of the 'Uni versal Experience is known as Sadalina Taller or Sadithya Tattoa. In Sadasiva, Tocha or Will is predominant. The experience of this stage is I am. Since "am" or "being" is affirmed in this stage, it is called Sadakhya Tattva ("Sat" meaning 'being') but 'am' implies "this" ( I amt, but "am" what ?-I am this') The experience of this stage is, therefore, 

I am this', but the, 'this is only a hazy experience (asphuta). The predominant side is still I'. The Ideal Universe is experienced as an indistinct something in the depth of consci ousness. That is why this experience is called "mitted" 

( 

f a: egt:). The 'This" (Idam) is Gintly experienced by 'T (Aham) as a part of the One Self; the emphasis is, however, on the "I' side of experience. The "This" (Idam) or the universe at this stage is like a hazy idea of the picture that an artist has at the initial stage of his creation. Rajānaka Ananda in his Vivarana on arriva Tattoo-andsha very rightly says: 

___ "तत्र प्रोन्मीलितमात्रचित्रकल्पतया इदमास्य अस्फुटत्वात इच्छाप्राधान्यम्" (p. 3) FIn that stage, the 'This' side of the Experience is hazy like a picture of an artist which is about to be port rayed and hence which is still in an ideal state (i.e., in the state of an idea). Hence in this state it is Will that is predomi nant". That is why Kyemaraja says in his 'Pratyabhiji hrdayam 

__ "सदाशिवतत्त्वेऽहन्ताच्छादितास्फुटेदसाममं विश्वम्" 

ie the Universe in Sadasiva tattoo is aspuud or hazy duminit ed by a clear consciousness of 'I'. Sada-Siva alla is the first manifestation (abhāsa). For ab Mrd or manifestation, there must be a perceive or knower and perceived or known i.c. a subj ct and an object. In this universal condition, both are bound to be Consciousness, for there is nothing clse than Consci ousness. Consciousness in this aspect becomes perceptible to Itself; hence a subject and an object. 

. 4. Iivara or Aifarya Talba 

The next stage of the Divine experience is that where Idam- the "This' side of the total experience becomes a little more defined (sphuta). This is known as Ifrara Tattua. It is wiwera or distinct blossoming of the Universe. At this stage, jana or knowledge is predominant. There is a clear idea of what is to be created. Rājānaka Ananda says in his Vivarana. 

"अत्र वेद्यजातस्य स्फुटावभासनात् ज्ञानशक्त्युकः" 

As at this stage, the objective side of Experience the "This' or the Universe is clearly defined, therefore jiano-dakti is predominant. Just as an artist has at first a hazy idea of the picture he has to produce, but later * clearer image of the picture begins to emerge in his view, even so at the Sadā Siva stage, the Universe is just a hazy idea, but at the Isvara stage, it becomes clearer. The experience of Sada-Siva is "I am this". The experience of Isvara is: "This am I." 

5. Saduidy or Suddhavidyd Talla In the Sadpidya talla, the 'I' and th: This' side of Experience are equally balanced like the two pans of an evenly held balance (samĀdhrta tula-puta nyäycna). At this stage, Kriya Sakti is predominant. The 'I' and 'This are recongnis ed in this state with such equal clarity that while both 'I' and "This' are still identified, they can be clearly distingui shed in thought. The experience of this stage may be called diversity-in-unity --(bhedābheda-vimaršanatmaka) i. e. while the This is clearly distinguished from 'I', it is still felt to be a part of the 'T' or Self. 'Both 'T' and 'This' refer to the same thing (i.e. they have samānādhikarana). 

In Siw latte, there is the I-experience (Aham vimarśi); in Sadasiva, there is I–This experience (Aham-idam Vimarfa); in Isvara tattva, there is This-I experience (Idamaham Vimarta). In each of these experiences, the emphasis is on the first term. In Suddha Vidyā tattva, there is equal emphasis on both. (Aham Aham-Idam Idam; I am I–This is This). Since this experience is intermediate between the para or the higher and gard-the lower in which there is sense of difference, it is called parapara dafi. 

It is called Sad-vidyd or Suddha Vidy, because at this stage the true relation of things is experienced. 

Upto this stage, all experience is ideal i.e. in the form of an idea. Hence it is called the perfect or "pure order" (Suddhādhvan) i.e. a manifestation in which the origa or real nature of the Divine is not yet veiled. 

II. The 

tatives of the limited Individual Experience 

——II May and the five Kacukas. At this stage, Maw talia begins its play. From this stage onward there is Afuddhādhyan or the order in which the real nature of the Divine is concealed. All this happens because of Maya, and her Kaicukas, Maya is derived from the root 'ma', to measure out. That which makes experience measurable i.e. limited and severs "This' from 'I' and 'I' from 

This" and excludes things from one another is Māyā. Upto Sadvidya, the experience was Universal; the 'This meant all-this'—the total universe. Under the operation of Maya, 

this' means merely this different from every thing else. From now on starts Santoca or limitation. Máy draws a veil (ävarana) on the Self owing to which he forgets his real nature, and thus Mayã generates a sense of difference." 

The products of Māra are the five kartculas or cove rings. We may notice them briefly : 

Kala. This reduces the Sarva-Karlstva (universal authorship) of the Universal Consciousness and brings about limitation in respect of authorship or efficacy. 

Vidyd. This reduces the omniscience (sarvajilatva) of the Universal Consciousness and brings about limitation in respect of knowledge. 

Raga. This reduces the all-satisfaction (pārņatva) of the Universal and brings about desire for this or that. 

Kāls. This reduces the eternity (nityatva) of the Universal and brings about limitation in respect of time i.c. division of past, present, and future. 

* 'मापाविभेदबुद्धिनिजांशजातेषु निखिलजीवेषु' 

Sat-trimblat - tnitva-- Sandoh - Verse 5. p. + 

Niyati. This reduces the freedom and pervasiveness (Svatantrata and vyäpakatva) of the Universal, and brings about limitation in respect of cause and space. 

III 

The Tattoas of the Limited' Individual 

Subject Object 

12 

Purusa 

Siva thus subjecting Himself to Māyā and putting on the five Kancukas or cloaks which limit His universal know ledge and power becomes Puruşa or the individual subject. Purusa does not merely mean the human person, but every sentient being that is thus limited. 

Purusa is also known as Anu which literally means a point. Point does not mean á spatial point here, for Anu being divine in essence cannot be spatial. Puruşa is called Anu because of the limitation of the divine perfection 

पूर्णत्वाभावेन परमिनर वादाण त्वम 

13. PRAKRTI While Puruşa is the subjective manifestation of the "I am this' experience of Sadvidyā, Prakti is the objective mani festation. According to Trika, Prakti is the objective effect uf Kala HIFIE TE TE TIG H II Tantral, Ahn, 

Prakrti is the barest objectivity in contrast with Puruga who is Vedaka or Subject . Praksti exists in a state of equili brium of her gums. 

There is a difference between the Sankhya conception of Praksti and that of Trika. Sankhya believes that Prakriti is one and universal for all the Purusas. Trika believes that cach Puruşa has a different Praksti. Prakrti is the root or matrix of objectivity. 

Prakrti has three gume-threads or constituents.viz, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas (producing respectively sukh, duhkha, and moha). Prakrti is the Santa Sakti of Siva and the gun Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas are the gross forms of His Saktis of Jäāna, Iccha, and Kriyā respectively. 

Puruşa is the Experient (bhokta) and Prakti is the experienced (bhogyā). 

IV. 

The Tattoas of Mental Operation 

14-16--Buddhi, Ahankara, and Mamr. 

Prakrti differentiates into antahkarana (the psychic apparatus), indriyas (senses) and bhftas matter). 

We shall first take up antahkarapa. It means literally the inner instrument i.e. the psychic apparatus of the individual. It consists of the tattoos by means of which there is mental operation, viz., Buddhi, Ahankara, and Manas. 

1. Buddhi is the first tattou of Prakriti. It is the ascertaining intelligence (Opeedyd urika) The objects that are reflected in Buddhi are of two kinds : (a) external e.g., a jar, the reflection of which is reocived through the eye ctc. (b) internal -the images built out of the Sarlstras (the impressions lest behind on the mind). 

2. Ahikard. This is the product of Buddhi. It is the I-consciousness and the power of self-appropriation. 

3. Manas. It is the product of Ahamkāra. It co operates with the senses in building up perceptions, and it builds up images and concepts. 

V. The Tallows of Sensible Experience 1. The five powers of senso-perception-Jnänendri yas or Buddhindrayas. They are the products of Ahamkāra, The five powers are those of 

(i) smelling (ghranendriya) (ii) tasting (rasanendriya) (ii) seeing (cakşurindriya) (iv) feeling by touch (spartanendriya) 

(v) hearing (Sravanendriya) 

2. The five karmendriyas or powers of action. These are also products of Ahamkāra. These are the powers of 

(i) speaking (vagindriya) (ii) handling (hastendriya) (ii) locomotion (pädendriya) (iv) excreting (Payvindriya) 

(v) sexual action and restfulness (upasthendriya) 

The indriyar are not sense-organs but powers which operate through the sense-organs. 

15 

3. The five taxmatras or primary elements of percep tion. These are also products of Ahankāra. Literally Farmālra means that only'. These are the general elements of the particulars of sense-perception. They are : 

(6) Sound-as-such (Sabda-tanmitra) (ii) Feel-as-Such (Sparsa-tanmätra) (iii) Colour-as-Such (Rūpa-tanmātra) (iv) Flavour-as-Such (Rasa-tanmātra) (v) Odour-as-such (Gandha-tanmatra) 

VIII The Tallas o Materiality 

32-36 The Fire Bhalar. The five gross elements or the pañca Mahabhatos are the products of the five tanmatras. 

() Akasa is produced from Sabda-tanmatra. (ii) Vāyu is produced from Sparsa-tanmätra. (iii) Agni or Teja, 

Rūpa-tanmatra, (iv) Apa 

Rasa-tanmnātra (v) Prithivi 

Gandha-tanmatra. All manifestation is known as abhisa-emanation of the Universal Consciousness. Every abhāsa is real at its own level. The abhäsa or appearance in a dream is quite real for the dream-consciousness. 

The übhāsas may be divided into (1) - sentient (jiva) and insentient (jada). 

The underlying consciousness to which cverything is an abhäsa remains unchanged. The abhāsas appear and disappear, but the underlying Consciousness remains unchanged, ever-lasting, and Self-existent. 

3. The Individual Self or jina The individual according to this system is not simply a psycho-physical being but something more. His physical aspect consists of the five mahabh atas or gross elements highly organised. This is known as his Sthūla-Sarira. He has also the psychic apparatus known as anlataraña (the inner instrument) consisting of widnias, buddhi, and altāra. 

Manas, buddhi and chantara together with the five tarmatras form a group of eight which is known as purvastaka. 

. 

This is the silma-farira in which the soul leaves the body at the time of death. 

There also works in him präna fake. This is the divine Sakti working both in the universe and the individual. It is by this prama fakti that cverything is sustained and maintained. 

There is also kundalini that is a form or expression of fakt. This lies dormant in the normal human being. 

Finally there is caitanya or Siva in the centre of his being that is his very Self. 

Though intrinsically the Self of man is Siva, he becomes an any or a limited individual because of 440 mala. 

4. Bondage The bondage of the individual is due to innate ignorance which is known as ima pala. It is the primary limiting condition which reduces the universal consciousness to an ANN Or a limited aspect. It comes about by the limitation of the Iccha Sakti of the Supreme. It is owing to this that the jina considers himself a separate entity, cut off from the universal strelm of consciousness. It is consciousness of self-limitation. 

Coming in association with the categories of the afuddha adhd or the order of extrinsic manifestation, he becomes further limited by myöva mala and kärmd-pala. Mayiya mala is the limiting condition bought about by majd. It is bhimedya-brath--that which brings about the consciousness of diflerence owing to the differing limiting adjuncts of the body etc. This comes about by the limitation of the jina fakti of the Supreme. 

It is by these malas that the individual is in bondage whirled about from one form of existence to another. 

5. Liberation Liberation according to this system means the re-cog nition (pratyabhijñā) of one's true nature which means in other words the attainment of aktrina cham - simaréa-the original, innate, pure 1-consciousness. The following verse of Utpala-deva gives an idea of pure I-Consciousness. 

"अहं प्रत्यवमर्शो यो विमर्शात्मापि वाग्वपुः । 

नासौ विकल्पः, स हाक्तो दयापेक्षी विनिश्रयः ।। (Išvara-pratyabhijña: JKanādhikara, VI Ahnika, Ist Verse) 

The pure I-consciousness is not of the nature of bikalpa, for vitalba requires a second i.e. all vitalpa is relational. The normal, psychological I-Consciousness is relational i.c., the Self-Consciousness is in contrast with the not-Self. The pure I-consciousness is not of this relational type. It is immediate dumreness. When one has this consciousness, one knows one's real nature. This is what is meant by liberation. As Abhinavagupta puts it (in Tantraloka I. p. 192). 

मोक्षो हि नाम नेवान्यः स्वरूपप्रपनं हि बत् । Moksa (Liberation) is nothing else but the awareness of one's true nature. 

By this real Iconsciousness, one attains Cidananda the blis of the cit or Universal Consciousness. The silla on the individual mind is now transformed into Cit or Universal consciousness. The attainment of this pure I conscious ness is also the attainment of Siva-Consciousness in which the entire universe appears as I or Siva. 

According to this system, the highest form of ananda Or bliss is jagadd.manda-the bliss of the world in which the whole world appears to the liberated soul as Cit or Siva. 

This liberation cannot be achieved by mere logic-chopping or intellectual pyrotechnics. It comes by Sakti- 

pa (the descent of Divine Sakti) or anugraha i.e. Divine grace. 

Sakti - pats Anugraha Those who, owing to the samhskäras of previous birth, are very advanced souls receive there or intense fakrimta. They are liberated without much Sadhani or preris. 

Those who are less qualified receive madhyama (akti pala. This induces them to seek a gure or spiritual preceptor, to get initiation and practise yoga. In due course, they get liberation. 

Those who are still less qualified receive manda (moderate) dakupala This creates in them genuine eager ness for spiritual knowledge and meditation. They will also get liberation in course of time. 

Upya But grace is not the outcome of caprice. It has to be carned by moral and spiritual discipline. The means of 

18 

carning grace have been divided under three broad heads, viz., Sambhavopiya, Saktopiya, and Anavopāya. These upyas are recommended to get rid of the malas so that one may become fit for receiving grace. 

Anovopiya is the means whereby the individual utilizes his own karanas or instruments as means for his transformation for Self-realization. It includes disciplines concerning the regulation of prana, rituals, concentration on one's chosen deity etc. Ultimately, it brings about Self-realization by the unfolding of modhya-dhame or dupunt. It is also known as kriyopaya, because Kriya-such as repetition of a mantra and the practice of rituals etc.-plays an important part in it. This is also known as bedopad, because this discipline starts with a sense of bhede or difference. 

Sattopaya is concerned with those psychological practices that transform the inner forces, and bring about in the indivi dual sandla or immersion of the individual consciousness in the divine. In this mostly wiatra Sakti comes into play by which the individual acquires pratibha jana or true know ledge; gradually his feeling of duality gets less and less and his consciousness merges in paru-sarrd. In this discipline one has to meditate something like this "I am Siva", "The whole universe is only an expansion of my true Self". 

In mpya, the senses, präna, and manas are presed into service; in fattopaya, it is was only that functions actively. It is also known as jānopaya, because mental activities play an important role in it. It is also known as bhedabhed-spa, because it is based both on difference and identity. By this, the kundalini rises up from miladhara without much effort for the control of pram, and brings about Self-realization. 

Sambhavopaya is meant for advanced aspirants who by meditating on Sita taitoa attain to His consciousness. This is the path of "constant awareness. One starts with the analysis of panca-krtza, ddhand of vikalpa-sapa, and the practice of the consciousness, that the universe is only re flection of it, but later even these have to be given up. This leads easily to pure I-consciousness. ...Ksemaraja' says that by the development of the madhya or ceptre, one attains ciddsanda or bliss of the Supreme con 

19 

sciousness. This madhya is to be conceived separately from the point of view of the above three wayas. From the point of view of the anapopaya-madhya' is the f 

dr between the idd and pingala that has to be unfolded. From the point of view of faktobaya, madhya' is the pard-sapid that has to be reached. From the point of view of Sambhapopaya, it is aktrima alam or the pure I-consciousness that is the radhya or centre of everything. It is the madhya that has to be attained by one of the above means. 

For the unfoldment of madhya, ksemarāja recommends pikalpa-ksaya, fakti-sarikoca, fakti - vikasa, dha-scheda, and the practice of ddyanta-tori. (for details, see Sūtra 18). 

Of these, vikalpa-kraya is sambhapopaya, fakti- sartoca and vitara are faktopdya, and päka-ccheda and adyanita-koti mibhalam are anapopdyc. 

Pratyabhijña lays the greatest stress on the meditation on parca-krty and the practice of pikalpa-kay. It maintains that the five-fold act of Siva, viz., sli, sthiti, saritura, pilaya and anugraha is going on constantly even in the individual. The aspirant should constantly dwell on the esoteric meaning of this five.-fold act in order to rise to higher consciousness. The mental perception of the individual with reference to a particular place and time is the sreti in him, the retention and enjoyment of what he perceives is the stiti or preserva tion. At the time of the delight of Iconsciousness, it is absorbed in consciousness. This is sarithara. When even after its being withdrawn, its impression is about to rise into consciousness again, it corresponds to vilayd. When it is completely absorbed into Cit or true Self by the process of hatha-pāka, it is daugraha. (Sutra 11 may be consulted for details). 

This practice qualifies the aspirant for pure cidānanda. Another method is vitalpa-kraya. The mind is the happy hunting--ground of all kinds of ideas that rise one after another like waves upon the sea. We get involved in these ideas and are unable to get behind them to the placidity of the under lying consciousness. The practice of citalpa-kşaya is reco mmended for getting rid of kpobha or mental agitation, and recapturing the underlying consciousness, on the surface of which the vitaipas have their play. This cannot be done byforce, for that creates resistance. This can be achieved only by clert parsivity, by relaxing the citta or mind, by not think ing of anything in particular, and yet not losing awareness. 

By these practices, one acquires samduda or immersion into the divine consciousness. In order that this samdesa may be full, perfect and an enduring experience, one has to practise Kramid-murd. (for details of Krama-mudrā, see Sutra 19). By Krama-mudra, the experience of identi fication of the individual consciousness with the universal Consciousness has to be carried out into the experience of the outer world. This system does not believe that sdmanda to be complete which lasts only so long as samadhi (contemple tion) lasts, and disappears after one rises from that state. It believes that that is perfect samāvesa in which even after getting up from the contemplative state, it continues, and the world no longer appears as merc'earth, carthy',but as 'apparc lled in celestial light", as an expression, and play of the Uni versal Consciousness, and the aspirant feels himself also as nothing but that consciousness. Then the world is no longer something to be shunned,but an eternal delight (jagadananda). Then does one truly acquire aktrima aham-pimarša-purcI — consciousness in which the world does not stand over against the I in opposition but is the expression of that I itself. 

This is the conception of loan-mutti in this system. The world--process starts from the pure I-consciousness of Siva. At the level of man that I--consciousness gets indentified with its physical and psychic coverings, and the world stands over against it as something different foto caro. The task of man is to re-capture that pure I-consciousness in which it and the universe are one. 

Surely, such a stage cannot be reached all at once. The system visualizes a hierarchy of experients who rise gradually in the evolutionary process to the pure I-consciousness of Siva. 

The normal individual is known as sakalı. He has all the three malas-karma, mayixa and anapa. After many re births during which he is the plaything of Nature-both physi cal and psychic, he is seized with psychic fever and tries to know the witnice and the polither of this life. This is the first expression of the dricgraha of Siva. 

If he is not very cautious and indulges in lower kinds of yoga, he may become a pralayakala. He is free from Karma mola, and has only maria and dada mala, but he has neither jäma nor kriji. This is not a desirable state. At the time of pralaya or withdrawal of the universe, cvery Sakala becomes a pralayakala. 

Vijñānākala is an experient of a higher stage. He has risen above ayd but is still below Suddha Vidya. He is free from the tarm and mayiya mala but has still anasa mala. He has jaria and iccha, but no kriya. 

Above the Vijnānākala are the experients in successive ascent known as Mantra, Mantesvara, Mantra Mahesvara and Siva Pramāta. These are free from all the three malas, but they have varying experience of unity-consciousness. (for details, the chart in Note No. 38 may be seen). 

It is only to the Sisa-pramal that every thing appears as Siva. 

Pure I-consciousness is the fons d origo of the entire world process. 

Involution starts from the pure I-consciousness of Siva. Evolution gets back to the same pure I-consciousness, but the pilgrim goes back to his home,enriched with the experience of the splendour of Siva he has had on the way. Veil after veil lifts, and he is now poised in the heart of Reality. He may now well exclaim in the words of Abhinavagupta : 

स्वतंत्रः स्वच्छात्मा फुरति सततं चेतसि शिवः पराधाक्तिपचेयं करणसरणिप्रान्तमुदिता । तदा भोगकारमा स्फुरति च समस्तं जगदिदम् 

न जाने कुत्राचं वानिरनुपतेत् सा तिरिति ।। (quoted by Mahe varānanda in Maharthamanjari p. 25). 

"It is Siva Himself, of un-impeded Will and pellucid consciousness, who is ever sparkling in my heart. It is His highest Sakti Herself that is ever playing on the edge of my senses. The entire world gleams as the wondrous delight of pure I. consciousness. Indeed I know not what the sound "world' is supposed to refer to."

ANALYSIS OF CONTENTS 

Sūtra 1-TW absolute Citi (Consciousness) out of its own freer will is the cause of the siddhi of the w orse 

Universe in this context means everything from Sadasiva down to the carth. 

Siddhi micans bringing into manifestation, maintenance, and withdrawal. 

The absolute consciousness alone is the power that brings about manifestation. Māyā, Praksti is not the cause of manifestation. Inasmuchas it (Citi) is the source of both subject, object, and pramāna (means of proof), no means of proof can prove it (i. c. its own source). 

Siddhi may be taken in another sense also. It may mean bhoga (experience) and moksa (liberation). Of these also the absolute freedom of the ultimate divine consciousness is the cause. 

The word 'hetu" in the sätra means not only cause in which sense it has been already interpreted above. It also means 'means'. So it is also the means of the individual's ascension to the highest consciousness where he becomes indentified with the divine consciousness. 

Citi has been used in the singular to show that it is un limited by space, time etc. It has been called batantra (of free will) in order to show that it by itself is powerful to bring about the universe without the aid of Māyā etc. 

Citi is, therclore, the cause of manifestation, the means of rising to Siva, and also the highest end. This Sätra strikes the key-note of the entire book. 

Sätra 2-Dy the poet of her own free will does she (Cit) urfold the wrives upon her own scredit. 

She brings about the universe by the power of her own free will, and not by any extraneous cause. The universe is already contained in her implicitly, and she makes it explicit. 

Sutra 3:-This (i.e. the universe) is manifold because of the differentiation of reciprocally adapted objects and subjects. 

" 

The universe appears to be different and manifold because of the differentiation of experients and the objects experienced. These may be summarised thus : 

1. At the level of Sada-Sina tattoa, the I-conscious ness is more prominent; the experience of the universe is just in an incipient stage. The individual experient who rise to such a level of consciousness is known as Mantra-mahe Svåra and is directed by Sadā diva. He has realized Sadalina Laita and his experience is of the form "I am this". The consciousness of this the universe) is not fully marked out from the I' at this level. 

2. At the level of Itara-taitoa, the consciousness of both 'I' and 'this is equally distinct. The individual experient who rises to this level is known as Mantreśvara. The universe is clearly distinct at this stage, but it is identified with the Self. Mantrešvara is directed by IŠvåra. 

3. At the level of Vidyā-tattva, the universe appears as different from 'I'. There is an experience of diversity. though it is diversity-in-unity. The individual experients of this stage are known as Mantras. They are directed by Ananta-bhattaraka. They have an experience of diversity all round, of the universe as being distinct from the Self (though it may still belong to the Self). 

4. The stage of the experient below Suddha vidya, but above May is that of Vijaandkala. His field of experience consists of sakalas and pralayākalas. He feels a sense of identity with them. 

. 5. At the stage of Maya, the experient is known as pralayakaalir. He has neither a clear consciousness of 'I', nor of "this', and so his consciousness is practically that of the void. 

6. From Māya down to the earth, the experient is sakala who experiences diversity all round. The average human being belongs to this level. 

Siva transcends all manifestation. His experience is that of permanent bliss and identity with every thing from Sadasiva down to the earth. Actually it is Siva who flashes forth in various forms of manifestation. 

. Sutra 4: He haping contraction of consciousness of Hür Hafure, though (guite) conscious (all the while) (appears) or the uniuse in a contracted form. 

It is sivá or at that by assuming contraction becomes both the universe and the experients of the universe. 

Knowledge of this constitutes liberation. 

Sutra 5:--it (Mirsal consciousness) itself descending from the stage of Crana becomes citta (individual consciousness) incwchas it becomes contracted by the object of consciousness. 

The universal consciousness itself becomes the individual consciousness by limitation. 

The universal consciousness in the process of limitation has either (1) the predominance of cit or (2) the predomi nance of limitation. 

In the former case, there is the stage of Vjānākala when prakala is predominant, or Suddha-vidya-pramātā, when both prakasa and vimarša are predominant, or Ita, Sadasiva, Anitrita-Siva. In the latter case, there is the stage of Sünya-pramātā etc. 

The universal consciousness itself by assuming limitation becomes individual consciousness. Jaana, Kriya and Māyā of the universal consciousness become saldod, rajas and lawas in the case of the individual. 

Sūtra 6 : The mw-frånáld consists of it (i.c. cilta) The maya-pranātā also is only Citta. 

Sätra 7 :--And though) At is one, he becomes of two-fold form, three-fold, four-fold and of the nature of severt pomlads. 

The air is Siva Himself. Consciousness cannot be sundered by space and time, and jada or the merely inert can be only an object of experience, not a subject of expe 

rience. 

Since by limitation it assumes the state of the experient and the object experienced, it is also of two forms. It also becomes three fold as it is covered with the mala pertaining to rw, maya, and karm. It is also four fold, because it assumes the nature of (1) fand, (2) prama, (3) buryataka, and (4) the gross body. The seven pentads i.e. the thiry five minds below Siva down to the earth is also its nature. He also becomes seven-fold experients and of the nature of five-fold coverings. 

Sätra 8-The positions of the wrious systems of philosophy are only various roles of that conscious or Se). 

The positions of the various systems of philosophy are, so to speak, roles assumed by the Self. 

1. The Carvakas, for instance, maintain that the Self is indentical with the body characterised by consciousness. 

2. The followers of Nyāya practically consider Buddhi to be the Self in the worldly condition. After liberation, they consider Self as identical with the void. 

3. The Mimärsakas also practically consider Buddhi to be the Self inasmuchas they believe the I-consciousness to be the Self. 

4. The Buddhists also consider only the functions of Buddhi as the Self. 

5. Some Vedantins regard Prāņa as the Self. 

6. Some of the Vedantins and the Madhyamikas regard "non-being as the fundamental principle. 

7. The followers of Pañcarātra believe Vasudeva to be the highest cause. 

8. The followers of Sankhya practically accept the position of the Vijānākalas. 

9. Some Vedantins accept Isvara as the highest prin ciple. 

10. The Grammarians consider pasyanti or sadāfiva to be the highest reality. 

11. The Tantrikas consider the Atman as transcending the universe to be the highest principle. 

12. The Kaulas consider the univene as the Atman principle. 

13. The followers of Trika philosophy maintain that the Atman is both immanent and transcendent. 

The Sutra may be interpreted in another way, viz., the experience of external things as colour etc., and internal experience as pleasure etc. become a means of the manifcs tation of the essential nature of Siva or the highest reality. 

Sutra-9--IX contrequartce of its limitation of Sakti, Reality which is all conciousness becomes the mala-Conered fawsarin. 

the malacoeered the free The Will-power being limited, there arises the draws 

. 

wala, the mala pertaining to the jioa by which he considers himself to be imperfect. 

Omniscience being limited, there arises knowledge of a few things only. Thus there comes to be máyiya mala, which consists in the apprehension of all objects as different. 

Omnipotence being limited, the jiva acquires kärm mala. 

Thus due to limitation, Saru- karijatoa (omnipotence) becomes Kală (limited agency) carpajilata (Omniscience) becomes widya (limitation in respect of knowledge), pūrmi (all fulfilment) becomes riga (limitation in respect of desire), Hitata (cternity) becomes Kala (limitation in respect of time), yapabata (omnipresence) becomes niyati (limitation in respect of space and cause). Jiva (the individual soul) is this limited self. When his Sakti is unfolded, he becomes Siva Himself. 

Sutra-10-Ex in this condition of empiriza! sely), he (the individual sou!) does the fiog krovar lite Him (ie. like Siva). 

Just as Siva docs the five-fold act in mundanc manifesta tion as an unfoldment of His real nature, so does He do it in the limited condition of a jina 

The appearance of objects in a definite space and time is tantamount to srstatā (emanation), their appearance in another space and time and thus their disappearance to the individual soul constitutes safthartt (withdrawal); conti nuity of the appearance of the objects consititutes sthäpakatā (maintenance) . Because of the appearance of difference, there is wilaya (conccalment). 

When the object is indentical with the light of conscious ness, it is divgraha (grace). 

Sutra 11--He also does the five-fold act of marifeting, reli shers, thinking owl, pundation of the wd and dissolution. This is so from the esoteric stand-point of the Yogin. 

Whatever is perceived is abhāsana or . The per ception is relished for sometime. This is rakti or wtiti. It is withdrawn at the time of knowledge. This is samhära. 

If the object of experience generates impressions of doubt etc., it becomes in germ the cause of transmigratory existence. This is bijdrastlaban or wilaya. 

If the object of experience is identified with conscious ness, it is the state of pilaparla or anugraha. 

Sutra--12—To be a santdrin man being deluded by one's own pozuers because of the ignorance of that ... authorship of the five-fold act.) 

In the absence of the knowledge of the five-fold act, one becomes deluded by one's own powers, and thus transmi grates ever and anon. 

While talking of all, we would do well to realize that the highest Vāk akti has the knowledge of the perfect 'I'. She is the great mantra inclusive of the letters a' to 'ka', and revealing the empirical experient. At this stage, she conceals the pure distinctionless consciousness and throws up ever new forms different from one another. 

The empirical experient deluded by the various powers considers the body, prlina etc. as the Self. Brāhmi and other faktis bring about emanation and maintenance of difference and withdrawal of identity in the empirical subject pašudada). 

At the stage of Pati', they do the reverse i.e. bring about the emanation and maintenance of identity, and with drawal of difference. Gradually they bring about the state of "aikalda'. This is known as pure Vikalpa power. 

The above technique of etablishing unity-consciousness is known as Sambhavopāyah". 

Now follow Sakopaya or Sakla technique of unity Consciousness. 

Cic-fatti in this context is known as Vāmestari. Her sub-species are thecari, gocari, di cari, And bhucari. These bring about objectification of the universal consciousness. By heart fakti, the universal consciousness becomes an indi vidual subject; by gocari fakt, he becomes endowed with an inner psychic apparatus; by dikoari fatti, he is endowed with outer senses, by bhacari, he is confined to external objects. By yogic practice, Alucari brings about consciousness of perfect agency; gocari brings about consciousness of non difference, dikcarl brings about a sense of non-difference in perception, blacari brings about a consciousness of all objects as parts of one Self. 

There is a third technique known as ānapopayah. When 

the cifwarya laki of the Lord conceals her real nature in the case of the individual and deludes him by prāna etc.. by the various states of waking, dreaming etc, and by the body both gross and subtle, he becomes a varir. When in the yogic process, she unfolds the wana fakti, and the bana fakti, the individual comes to acquire the experience of turya and motita states, and becomes liberated while living. 

Sdtra-13-Aequiring full knowledge of is (i.c of the fiw-fold act of the Self Citta itself becomws Citi by rising to the status of clana. 

When the knowledge of the five-fold act of the Self dawns on the individual, ignorance is removed. The Citta (individual consciousness) is no longer deluded by its own limiting powers; it re-captures its original freedom, and by acquiring a knowledge of its real naturc, rises to the status of cit (i. e. universal consciousness). 

Sdtra-14The fire of Cin an when it descends to the (lower) stage, though covered by maya) partly burn the full of the known i. d. the objects). 

If it is non-differentiating consciousness intrinsically, why is it that it is characterized by a sense of difference at the level of the individual ? 

The answer is that cven at the level of the individual, Cid does not completely lose its nature of non-differentiation, for all the multifarious objects as known are assimilatd to Citi itself i.e. in the knowledge-situation, the objects become a part and parcel of Cil. As fire reduces to itself every thing thrown into it, even so, Ciri assimilates to itself all the objects of knowledge. Only owing to its being covered by Máyd, citi does not reduce objects of knowledge to itself completely, for owing to the previous impressions (sanskaras), these objects appear again. 

Sero 15—In the re-affertion of its inherent) power, it makes the main is owux. 

Bala or power means the emergence of the real nature of Gili. Then Cili manifests the whole universe as identical with itself. This is no the temporary play of Citi, it is rather its permanent nature. It is always inclusive, for without this 

29 

inclusive nature of Citi even body and other objects would not be known. Therefore, the practice recommended for acquiring the power of Citi is meant only for the removal of the false identification of oneself with the body etc. 

Saira-16-When the bliss of Cit is altained, there is the lasting acquisition of that state ist which Cit is our only Self, and ist thick all things that appear are identical with Cit. Es the body etc. that is experienced appears a identical with Cir. 

The steady experience of identity with Cit means jivan MUKA (liberation even in this physical body). This comes about by the dissolution of ignorance on the recognition of one's true nature. 

Sutra--17– By the devlopment of the centre is acquisition of the bliss of the spirit. 

By the development of the centre can the bliss of the spirit be obtained. It is called the centre, because it is the support or ground of every thing in the world. In the indi vidual, it is symbolized by the central di i.e. fund. When the central consciousness in man develops or when the SESMT riddi develops, then is there the bliss of the univenal consciousness. 

Sūtra-18—Herein (ie. for the dewlopment of the Centre) the warf are : 

Dissolution of vitalpa; fankoca-pikäsa of Satri; cutting of the odhas; the practice of the comuxtemplation of the Koti (point) of the beginning and the end. 

The first method is vitalpalaya. One should concen trate on the heart, should not allow any vikalpa to arise, and thus by reducing the mind to an avitalpa condition, and holding the Self as the real experient in the focus of conscious ness, one would develop the madhya or consciousness of central reality and would enter the furya and furyadila condition. This is the main method of Pratyabhijña for madhya-bikasa. 

The other methods do not belong to Pratyabhijna but are recommended for their utility. Santaca and pildsa of fatti. Sartoca of fakti means withdrawing of consciousnes that rushes out through the gates of the senses, and turningit inwardly towards the Self. Vikana of fakti means holding -the consciousness steadily within, while the senses are allowed to perceive their objects. Another way of acquiring sanlibaca and pikira of fakii is the practice of prasara and bifranti in the stage of Ardhara kundalini Emergence from samdhi while retaining its experience is prasara or vitāra, and merging back into samadhi and resting in that condition is piranti or Farukoca. 

A third method is adha-cheda i. c. cessation of prima and apara by repeating inwardly the letters 'ka', 'ha' etc. with out the vowels, and tracing the mantras back to their source where they are unuttered. 

A fourth method is adyanta-koti-ribhalana i.e. the practice of fixing the mind at the time of the arising of prāna and its coming to an end between the adi i.e. the first or heart and the anta i.c, the distance of twelve fingers from the heart. 

Sulra-19--In uyutthana which is full of hd arter-effects of ramadhi, there is the attainment of Pamamen samadhi, by dwelling on orr's identity with Ci! (oral conscious ) Oper and our again. 

Even on the occasion of vyutthina, the yogin sees the entire universe dissolve in Cit by the process of milano samddhi. Thus he acquires permanent Sanidhi by Krama mudra. 

as a result of entering into the perfect orcions or Self which, is in essence it and dranda (i... consciousness and bits) and of the nature of th great w ra-porover, there accines the altainment of lordship Ober one's proud of the Cities of conciousness that brings about all mortation and re-absorption of the wriderse. All this is the nature 

of Siva. 

When one masters kramtdmudra etc., one enters into the real, perfect I-consciousness or Self, and acquires mastery or lordship over the group of consciousness-deities that bring about emanation and absorption of the universe. The per fect I-consciousness is full of light and bliss. No longer is the individual deluded into considering his body, gross or subtle, prāņa or senses as the 'I'., he now considers the divine light whithin as the real 'I'. This real 'I' is the sampit, sadativa 

31 and Mahevara. This I-consciousness means the resting of all objective experience within the Self. It is also called Sodtartrya or sovereignty of Will, the primary agency of every thing and lordship. This consciousness of pure 'I' is the forts a origo of all the mantras, and therefore it is of great power. It is the universal C\# itself. By acquiring this consciousness, one becomes the master of these faktis that bring about the emanation and absorption of the universe.

In this world, there are some devoted people, who are undeveloped in reflection and have not taken pains in studying difficult works like Logic and Dialectics, but who neverthe less aspire after Samīball with the highest Lord which blossoms forth with the deacent of Sakti. For their sake, the truth of the teachings of Isvara-pratyabhijñā" is being explained briefly. 

In order to explain the universal causality of the divinity that is the Self (of all), its attainability by easy means, and the high reward, it is said (lit., he says) :-- 

Sutrali 1. The absolutek Cirit of its own free will is the cause of the Siddhi of the universe. 

Comietary 

of the universe or Vifoa-means from Sadāsiva17 etc. down to the earth. (In the matter of) Siddhi means 'in effectuation' i.e., in bringing about srsti or manifestation, sthiti or continued existence, and samhara or resting in the 

\#This is a great and well-reasoned out work on Pratyabhijak by Utpali 

clirya who flourished in the gih Century A.D. Prof. Lcidecker translates cven Ifvara-pratyabhijn. He is unable to see that what Ksemaraja men to say is that he is giving summary of the teachings of Isvara pratyabhiji. 

प्रत्यभिज्ञाहृदयम् रूपा 'चितिः' भगवती 'स्वतन्त्रा'-अनुत्तरविमर्शमयी शिवभट्टा रकाभिन्ना हेतुः'-कारणम् । अस्यां हि प्रसरन्त्यां जगत् उन्मिपति व्यवतिष्ठते च, निवृत्तप्रसरायां च निमिषति -इति स्वानुभव एव अत्र साक्षी । अन्यस्य तु मायाप्रकृत्यादेः चित्प्रकाशभिन्नस्य अप्रकाश मानत्वेन असत्त्वात् न क्वचिदपि हेतुत्वम् । प्रकाशमानत्वं तु प्रकाशै कात्म्यात् प्रकाशरूपा चितिरेव हेतुः न त्वसौ कश्चित् । अत एव देशकालाकारा एतत्सष्टा एतवनुप्राणिताश्च नैतत्स्वरूपं भेत्तु मलम् । -इति व्यापक-नित्योदित-परिपूर्णरूपा इयम्-इत्यर्थलभ्यमेव एतत् । 

Highest Experientia. (In bringing about all this), the Highest Sakti, 17 viz. the divine consciousness which is absolute and of free will, consists of the highest pimursa, and is non distinct from Sinabhallarata 21 is the ketu or cause. It is only when (Citi), the ultimate consciousness comes into play that the universe comes forth into being (lit, opens its eyelids), and continues as existent, and when it withdraws its move ment, the universe also disappears from view (lit., shuts its eye-lids). One's own experience would bear witness to this fact (lit, in this matter). The other things, viz., Māyi, Prakrti etc., since they are supposed to be) different from the light of consciousness can never be a cause of anything (lit., anywhere), for not being able to appear (owing to their supposed difference from consciousness) they are ( as good as ) non-existent. But if they appear, they become one with the light (of consciousness). Hence Citi which is that light alone is the cause. Never is the other one (viz., Māyā, Prakrti) any cause. Therefore, space, time, and form which have been brought into being and are vitalized by it (Citi) are not capable of penetrating its rcal nature, because it is all pervading, cternal (lit, ever risen), and completely full (in itself). This is to be understood by the import (of the Sūtra). 

Leidecker translates it as "reson" (which is the dicilantry meaning). "This is entirely crtancoul. It is not on which hrings about this world, nor is it absolute and of free will.

It may be objected. Is not the universe also non-existent(lit, nothing whatsoever), different as it is from it (consciousness). If it be maintained that the universe is non-different (from Cit), how can one establish the relation of cause and its effect (between cil and jagat if they are identicals). 

The answer is-It is the divine consciousness alone (cidroa bhagavati )-luminous, absolute and free-willed as it is which flashes forth in the form of numerous worlds. This is what is meant by the causal relation here. It is used in its highest sense: * Since this (i. c. consciousness) alone is the cause of the Siddhi i.c. manifestation of the universe which consists of prawiata (subjects or knowers), pramana24 (know ledge and its means), and prameyas (objects or the known), therefore poor means of proof (pramāna) whose main function is to bring to light new objects, is neither fit nor qualified to prove the (ultimate ) consciousness, (which is ever present) which is absolute, unlimited and self-luminous. This is declared in Trikasära as follows) S 

$ i.e. In causal relation, the effect is believed to be different from the 

čius. Cris supposed to be the cause of the univers, but if the universe is non-different from the cause, how can it be its effect? (for the effect must be different from the cause) In the highest sease, the causal relation does not mtän succession, but simultancul expression. The flutter of Ci is simultaneous minifesin tion of the universe.

- Just as (when) one tries to jump over the shadow of one's head with one's own foot, the head will never be at the place of one's foot, so (also) is it with baindal Kala4. 

Since it (consciousness) is the curse of the Siddhi of the universe-Siddhi (here) meaning Sanhara which consists in bringing about-Sâmarasya?? or identity with the highest non-dual consciousness), therefore is it called Svatantra ie free-willed. Its free will being recognized, it becomes the cause of the siddhis (i.c. attainment) of the universe, which siddhi is of the nature of bhoga i.e. experience and mokya i.c. liberation (from the bondage of limited experience ). By repetition, the sütra can be interpreted in the above sense also. 

[Now the word "hetu' is taken in the sense of means] Again, vifba or universe means (external objects like) blue (etc.). (internal feeling like) pleasure, (limited experient) body, prāna etc. Its (i.c., of the Visva) siddhi (i.c., fulfilment or establishment) is the ketu or means of the awareness of Citi. This siddl consists in the apela or merging in the Self which is of the nature of vimarda by gradual mounting, beginning with pramidina or knowledgets (and coming to rest in the pramata

$ Siddhi also means fruition, attainment, perfection. It is in this sense 

that the writer now interprets the word "Siddhi".

The conciousness of object and subject is common to all the embodied Otice. The Poginu, however, have this distinctiva that they are mindful of this relation" (i.e. the object is always related to the subject; with out consciousness, there is no such thing is an object). 

Citi (consciousness) used in the singular (in the sitra) deriotes its fion-limitation by space, time etc., (and thus), shows the unreality of all theories of dualism. The word spalanina (absolute, of free will) (in the sutra) points out the fact that supreme power is of the essence of cit, and thus dis tinguishes it from the doctrine of Brahman (i.c. Sänkara Vedanta, where the Cit is considered to be non-active). The word vira etc. declares that it (Cir)has unlimited power, can bring about every thing, is an easy means (for emancipa tion), and is the great reward (i.e. it is an end in itself). 

. Sukhopaya" does not mean "way to happines' a 'rof. Leidecker thinks.

But here a question arises-If CH is the cause of the universe, it would presuppose material cause etc. (in order to bring about this apprently different universe) and (thus there would be) non-abandonment of dualism. Apprchending this (question), he (the author) says: 

Sutra 2. By the power of her own will alone), she (citi) unfolds the universe upon her own screen (i.e. in herself as the basis of the universe). Commentary 

Svecchayā-i.e. by the power of her own will, not by the will of another as (is maintained by) the Brahman doctrine, and similar (systems). Morcover (the phrase) by the power of her own will' implies (that she brings about the universe) by her power alone, not by means of any extraneous) material cause etc. In this way (i.e, on the pre supposition of material cause etc.), if the aforesaid absolute, free will is denied to her (i.e. to Citi), her Cit-ness itself would not be possible (i.e. air and free will are inseparable). 

Swabhittar means on her own screen (i.c. in herself as the basis), not anywhere else. She unfolds the previously defined universe (i.e. from Sadāsiva down to the earth) like a cityप्रत्यभिशाहदर्यम् स्थितस्यैव प्रकटीकरणम् ।-इत्यनेन जगत: प्रकाशकात्म्येन अवस्था नम् उक्तम् ।। २॥

in a mirror, which though non-different from it appears as different. * Usmiana means only making explicit what is already lying (implicit) (in citi). By this is meanat the existence of the universe (in citi) as identical with the light (of citi). 

Now in order to make clear the nature of the universe by means of analysis, he (the author) says: 

Sutra 3. That (i.e. the universe) is manifold because of the differentiation of reciprocally adapted (anurópa) objects (grahya) and subjects (gråhaka). Commentary 

Tal (that) means the universe; nāna' means manifold. Why (manifold)? Because of the differentiation (bheda) between objects and subjects which are anürüpa i.e. in a state of reciprocal adaptation. 

[The correspondence or reciprocal adaption of object and subject now follows]. 

Just as in the Sadā-Siva principle, there is the experience of) the total universe (Visva) as an object (grāhya) of the

nature of parā-para i.c. both identical and different, (a stage in which the experience is of the form 'I im this') (in which) the experience is dominated (acchädita) by the Consciousness of I (ahantā), and (in which the experience of) this-ness (idanta) is (yet) incipient (asphuta), cven so there is the group of expericnts (pramātārs), called mantramaheraras who are governed by the blessed Lord Sadasiva, 31 and whosc existence in that state is brought about by the will of the highest Lord. 

Just as in the Ifwara latte (principle), the entire universe is apprehended (grahya) (in the form, "I am thism) where both the consciousness of I (ahantā) and that of this (idantā) are simultaneously distinct (sphuta), even so (tathāvidha eva) is the consciousness of) the group of indivi dual experients, (known as) mantredoara, governed by venerable Isvara.33 

In the stage of Vidyä or Suddha Vidya, just as there are the experients, called Mantras, of different states together with many secondary distinctions, governed by Anantabha ttäraka, even so there is as an object of knowledge (prameya) one universe whose sole essence consists of differentiations 

Above Māyā (and below Suddha Vidya) are the ex perients, called Vijnanakalas who are devoid of (the sense of) agency (Kartptă), and who are of the nature of pure awareness (Suddha-bodhātmānah). Corresponding to them is their

(After the pralayatalar) are stationed the sakalas (from Maya) upto the earth who are different from every thing and limited, and whose field of experience is as limited as themselves (tatha bhutam.ST 

Sivabhattaraka, however, who transcends all this (mani festation), who is constituted only of prakasa (light) has states or modes which are only of the form of prakása (light).38 Again in blissful Paramasiva (highest Siva) who both trans cends the universe and is the universe, who is highest bliss and consists of a mass of prakása (light i.e. consciousness) Aashes the entire universe from Siva down to the earth in identity (with Parima Siva). Actually in that state), there is neither any other subject (grähaka) nor object (grädya). Rather what is practically meant to be stated (abhihitaprāyam) is this that the highest blissful Siva alone manifests himself in this way in numerous forms of multiplicity. 

As the Lord has the entire universe as his body, so

Sutra 4. The (individual) experient also, in whom cili or consciousness is contracted has the universe (as his body) in a contracted form. 

Commary 

The magnificent highest Siva desiring to manifest the universe, which lies in Him as identical with Himself, in the form of Sadāfiva and other appropriate forms flashes forth (prakasamânataya sphurati) at first as non-different from the light (of consciousness) (prakasablicden) but not experienc ing the unity of consciousness (in which the universe is identified with consciousness) (cidaikya-akhyatimaya). of which state andfrita-fine is only another name, (anāfrita Siva--paryāya), and being (as yet) more void than the void itself (from the point of view of any objective manifestation)40 Then He unfolds Himself in the totality of manifestations viz., worlds (bua), entities (barba), and their respective ex perients (pramātāras) which are only a solidificd form (āsyanatā-rūpa) of Cit-essence. I

from Siva the consciousnes of his full mature (Siva Svrupapohanam). Prof. Leidecker gives a Curious translation of this sentence, Viz "He is their true nature, while ihey distinguish themselves by not having lost the snvour ofcii". Citas does not incan tbe lavour of cit," but the esence of citind atynata doo not mean non-distinction, but solidification, I... Concrete manifestation of the subtle cience of cli (cit-rata). Ras is up or juice in this context, and suggests that as liquid juice may be solidified, even p cit may assume concrete manifestation.

As thus the Lord is universe-bodied (bhagavan vis. vasarirah), therefore the Sutra says), so the individual) experient also, because of consciousness being contracted, has the body of the entire universe in a contracted form even as the bala tree appears in a contracted form in its seed. So does the Siddhanta (the settled doctrine of the system) say: 

"One body and embodied really include all the bodies and the embodied". 

Trifiromata also declare that the subject or self becomes the universe in a contracted form. Beginning (thus) : 

"The body is of the form of all gods;" hear now, con cerning it, my dear.41 It is called earth because of its solidity, and water because of its fluidity," it ends by saying. 

"The three-headed' Bhairavais peresent in person (sākşāt vyavasthitah), pervading the entire universe."

Here this is the implication. The experient or subject is identical with Siva whose body is the universe, because light (of consciousness) is his true nature, and because of the reason ings of the Agamas (just) mentioned; only because of his (Siva's) Maya-Sakti, he (the experient) appears as contracted, because his real nature is not manifested. Contraction also, - on (close) consideration, consists of cit (consciousness) only, since it is manifested only as of the nature of cit, otherwise (i.c. in the absence of its being manifested, and it can be mani fested only when it is of the nature of consciousness), it becomes mere nothing. Thus every subject is identical with revered Siva whose body is the universe. It has been said by myself (elsewhere). 

"If it be said that aklydi or nescience is that which never appears i.e. which is never experienced, then appearance, or knowledge alone remains. If it be said that athyati does appear i.c. is experienced in some form), then (obviously) being of the nature of knowledge, knowledge alone remains"." 

With this intention, the identity of the Jis (the individual experient), and Siva (the universal experient) has been declared in Spanda-Sastra" (in the versa) starting with :

Sutra 5. "Citi (universal consciousness) itself des cending from the stage of) Celana (the conscious stage disposed to apprehend objects) becomes Citla (individual consciousness) inasmuchas it becomes contracted (Sankocini) in conformity with the objects of con sciousness (cetya)". 

Commentary 

Truly speaking Citta (individual consciousness) is not inything else, rather it is the exalted Citi (universal cons ciousness) itself. Now, when Cui conccaling its real nature accepts contraction or limitation, then it has only two aspects. Sometimes it flashes forth with the predominance of Cit, subordinating to itself limitation which has made its appearance; sometimes it appears) with the predominance of limitation. In the case of Cit being predominant in its natural state, and there being the predominance of prakala only (without vimarśa), its pramitr, or experient is Vijna riitala. In the case of both pratada and vimarła being pre dominant, the experient is vidyāpramáta. Even in this state (prakasa-parimarsa-pradhanatve), as the contraction (of

Where, however, contraction or limitation is predominant, there oocurs the knowership of the Void etc.49 

This being the position, cili (the universal consciousness) itself, in the form of the limited subject, descending from its stage of contana (universal consciousness), disposed towards com prchending objects, being limited by its objects of conscious ness, like blue (i.c. external object of consciousness), pleisure (i.e. internal object of consciousness) etc. being limited by

simply absurd. "The text, very clearly days, Sankochtyi tanu ayam Tia-diva-annintari ti" i.c. in the case of the land of contrac tion, there are the states of Ida, Sadaliya and Anlrita-Siva, If land is to be translated ny Corporeality, as Prof. Leidecker has done, it would mean that the states of Min, Sadasiva ctc. get more and more corporcal. "This would be the height of absurdity. Tanuta here means attenuation in this context (which k pliilologically the Ame word as tänuts), not 

corporeality. 1. The idea is that CT-pradl a (predominance of cit) is either natural 

(rahje) or acquired through the effort of Saaddhi (Samadhi prapal Mjin).

In the case of predominance of Cit ncquired through the effort of Samidhi, the Suddhabram taras reach the highest degree by stages.

both limitations (.c. external and internal objects of cons ciousness) becomes citla (individual consciousness). Thus has it been said in the excellent Pratyabhinja. 

"Those that appear in the realities of the own being of Pali (the Lord i.e. Siva) as Jivna and kriya, with my as the third (principle) become sale, rajar and tans in the Case of Part [the individual jipa)" By this and other such statements, (it is clear that) Citi (universal consciousness) which is of the nature of absolute freedom and which has the powers of jalina, kriya, and mājā becomes owing to excess of limitation in the state of pain the individual soul) Citta (individual consciousness) which is of the nature of Salled, rajas, and tamar.55 This has been stated in Pratyabhijña (1.e. Isvara-pratyabhijña of Utpala-deva). 

Because the individual consciousness is, even in the state of Vikalpa,\#of the nature of the highest real (i.c. Siva), therefore with a view to finding out that (tal i.e. the Highest Rcal), it has been said in the excellent Tatlu-garblue-stofra.प्रस्पमिशाइदयम् इति ॥ ५ ॥

In view of the fact that citta is the real nature of Māya pramätr, it is said 

Sutra-6. The Mayapramatr"7 consists of it (i. e. Citta). Commentary 

Cilla is predominant in the sphere of life and body. The sphere of the void also consists of the sanskaras (impressions, dispositions) of the Citta, otherwise one who awakes (from the experience of the void) would not be able to follow one's duties. Therefore, tidvipramily consists of Cilla only. With this purport, in Siva-sutra, while discussing reality (vastu vrtta-anusirena), having said that universal consciousness (citanami) is the Sell, it is again said that 'individual conscious ness (aittam) is the Self when the occasion for discussing the characteristics of māya-primats arises.

Since marti or liberation is possible only by 4 correct knowledge of the truc nature of the Self, and transmigration (from life to life) (samsāra) is due to an incorrect knowledge (thereof), therefore is it proposed to analyse the true nature of it (i.e. the Self) bit by bit

Since consciousness (lit., light of consciousness) itself, through the sovereignty of its free will assumes the limita tion of prata etc. and the state of the experient of limited objects, therefore is it that it is of two-fold form, viz., the manifester i.e. the light of consciousness, and limited mani festation. 

Owing to its being covered by the mala pertaining to gu, amayd, and karima, it becomes three-fold, 

It also) becomes fourfold, because of its assuming the nature of (1) Sanyo (2) frana (3) purgaplata'l and (4) the gross body. 

The seven pentads i.c., the thirty-five falloas (principles), from Siva down to the earth are (also) its nature (or septa and praca in the sutra may be taken separately as seven and five). So from Sina down to sałala, the consciousness consists of a lieptad of experients. Though its essential nature is that of cil (consciousness), amida (bliss), recht (will), Jilana (knowledge), Ariyil (action)-alive-fold nature, it becomes of the form of another pentad, limited as it becomes by the coverings of kala, vidya, rāga, kāla, and niyati, owing to athyari (nescience).

Sutra-8. The positions of the various systems of philosophy are only various roles of that (Conscious ness or Self). Comentary 

The positions i.e. the settled conclusions of all the systems of philosophy, viz., Carvata and others are, so to speak, this Self's assumed roles accepted of his own accord like the roles accepted by an actor. 

Thus the Carvãkas maintain that the Self is identical with the body characterized by consciousness. The followers of Nyāya etc. consider Self so long as it is in the worldly condition, as practically identical with buddhi (intuitive faculty of certain

knowledge) which is the substratum of knowledge, and other qualities. In liberation, when buddhi disappears, they regard Self as almost identical with the void. The followers of Mimärhsa are also tied down to buddhi inasmuchas they think 

i.e. the limiting conditions of pleasure and pain, is the Self. The followers of Sugata" also stop with only the functions of buddhi, maintaining that the fundamental principle is only 1 cintinuum of cognitions. Some of the followers of Vedānta regard prāna (the vital principle) as the Self. 

The Brahmavādins (advocates of the Veda) who con sider non-being (abhāva) as the fundamental principle on the ground (of the Upanisadic dictum) that all this wius originally non-being', accept the position of the void, and are (thus) landed in it. The Madhyamikas64 are also in the same position. 

The Pancarätras (believe) that Lord Väsudeva is the highest cause (prakrti)"; the individual souls are like sparks

The Sänkhyas* and others (of similar views) cling to the stage characterized mostly by the Vijñānākalas.70 

Other knowers of Vedānta cling to Isvara-principle (13 the highest) status, (depending as they do on the Upanipadic dictum)-"Being alone was there in the beginning." 

The exponents of Vyakarana, considering Atman (Self) principle as Sabda-brahman in the form of payant171 attribute the highest reality to the status of Sri Sadasiva. Likewise other systems may also be inferred to represent only 1 part of our system). This has also been described in the Agamas (in the following verse) : 

"The Buddhist rest content with the Buddhi principle, the Arhotną25 with the guiar, the Veda-knowers with the Puruta, And the Pancarias

The Tantrikas maintain that the loan principle trans cends the universe. Those who are wedded to the sacred texts of kula" ctc. consider that the aman principle is steeped in the universe (i.c. that the universe is only a form of the atman). The knower of Trika philosophy, however, main tain that the dtman principle is both immanent in the universe and transcends it. 

Thus of the one Divine whose essence is consciousness, all these roles are displayed by his absolute will, (and) the differences in the roles are due to the various gradatious in which that absolute free will either chooses to reveal or conceal itself. Therefore the Atman is one only, pervading thus far (i.c. revealing himself up to the stage discovered by Trika). 

Those of limited vision, however, in various parts are caused to identify themselves with the various (limited) stages by His will on account of which, even though when it is made clear that the extension of the knowledge of the preceding experients is limited to the stage of body etc., they are unable to comprehend the great pervasion (of the Ātman) described above (by Trika philosophy) unless the highest Sakti descend upon them .c. without the grace of the highest Sakti). As has been said -

"The Valgava and others who are colourel (i. c. Whost minds are coloured) by Vidy,78 do not know the highest God, the omniscient, full of knowledge. Likewise, (it has been said) in Sacchanda tantra, (roth Paial, verse 1141) 

Máyd only whirls these (followers of other systems) round who desite to obtain libération (moka) in non-liberion (i.c. in those disciplines and scriptures which tre incapable of offering liberation)" and also, (it has been said in Netra-Tantra, 8th Patal, verse 30) "The pursuers of the limited as the Stir( e. in.. the body in Self, the buddhi 

Self etc.) do not reach the highest stage of Siva". Also (There is mother interpretation of the salra: Darfana is to be interpreted, not as a system of philosophy, but merely as knowledge; sthiti, not as stage, but as inward cessation; bhumika--not as role, but as means—the whole interpretation is as follows) : The 

Prof. Leidecker's translation - The worshippers of d do not reach the highest place" is to say the least, highly misleading. It is not the worshippers of the Seli who do not reach the highest stage, but those who corider the bely, buddhi etc. \# Sell

Even 50, whenever the external form (of consciousness ) comes to rest in the essential nature of the knower), there comes to be cessation of the external thing (samhära) i.e. resting in a condition of inner peace, and then stringing together of a continuous series of various experiences (sarvit-santati) which will be arising anew (udesyat). Thus this venerable turiya(fourth) conscious ness whose nature it is to hold together emanation, maintenance and re-absorption flashes fourth ceaselessly (lit, without succes sion) now sending forth diversities of various emanations (creat ed things), and now with-drawing (them)-always emaciated and yet always full, of both forms (i.e. both emaciated and full) and also not undergoing any of these forms.§ It has been said in Sri Pratyabhijña tika-"When re-absorbing the objects, she (Sakti) Aashes (lit, rises) (in Her nature), and

Thus the Will-power (of the Absolute) whose sovereignty is unrestricted, assuming limitation, becomes anu-mal, which consists in its considering itself imperfect. (In the ciuse of) knowledge-power, owing to its becoming gradually limited in the world of differentiation, its omniscience becomes reduced to knowledge of a few things (only). By Assuming extreme limitation beginning with the acquisition of an inner organ, and organs of perception, it acquires māyiya malai which consists in the apprehension of all objects as different.

Thus by accepting limitation, the faktis (powers) omni potence, omniscience, perfection, etermity, omnipresence appear respectively as kala (limited agency), vidyā (limitation in respect of knowledge), rāga (limitation in respect of desire) kala (limitation in respect of time), and niyati (limitation in respect of space and cause).64 Thus constituted this (atman or Self) is called samarin (a transmigratory being), poor

As to how the Lord is always the author of the five-fold act, I have extensively demonstrated in Spandasandoha. Thus this authorship of the five-fold act occurring within one's own personnl experience, if pursued steadily with finn understanding, reveals the Lord's greatness to the devotee. Therefore, those who always ponder over this (five-fold act of the Lord), knowing the universe as an unfoldment of the essential nature (of consciousness), become liberated in this very life. This is what the sacred) tradition maintains (itiamnatah). Those who do not ponder like this,

These i.c. these five-fold acts," he does--this is (syntacti cally) connected with the previous. From the point of view of the highest end (mahärthadsstya), whatever appears through the successive functioning (lit., expansion of the goddess of sight and other (perceptual functions) is, (so to speak) emanated (srjyate) (This is abhasana or manifesting).

(This relishing of the experience for sometime represents stili or maintenance). It is withdrawn at the time of vimarśa (vimarśana-samaye) for which another word is sudden flash of delight (camtkāra) 1 (This knowledge of the object represents sarihara).

However, if at the time of the re-absorption or withdrawal (of the experience of manifoldness or differentiation), it (i.c. the object of experience) generates various sadrskaras (impressions) of doubt etc. inwardly, then it acquires the state of samstīra in germ which is bound to spring forth into existence again, and thus it super-poses on the experient) the state of wilaya (concealment of the real nature of the Self).

As knowledge, the objects are simply part and parcel of consciousness itself). The intention of using the word matra (in part, partly) (in the sūtra) is this-Though devouring (the object of knowledge), it does not consume it wholly, but only parily, because it again makes it rise by means of the serieskaras (i.e. the impressions of the objects left on the mind).That all experients have the power of devouring (i.e. assimilating objects of experience to conscious nes) is proved by one's own experience. As has been (rightly) said by the revered Utpaladevalt in his hymns.

Citi by the submergence of the covering of body, prām, etc. and by bringing into prominence ler essential nature, by lier emergence is, bala or power. As has been said, "Then having resorted to that power, ihe wula,190 (becoming all-knowing and powerful acquire efficiency)". 

___ Thus when the power (of consciousness) is gained i.e. when one betakes to one's real nature that has now emerged, 

$ Here, prdara and waters of the knies are connected succesively with 

sarga and santifra of the objective existence. Sa tara in this context goes not mean contraction or limitation, but closing, withdrawing.

It would not be right to say--"The inclusive role of cili when it assimilates to itself the entire universe is only temporary: How then can it (i.c. the inclusive role) be accepted ?" (This objection is not valid), for the inclusive nature of citi appears as temporary only because of the emer gence and immergence of the body etc. In reality, the tempo rary appearance of the inclusive nature of citi is due to the emergence of the body etc. which are brought into manifes tation by the sovereign will of citi herself. This inclusive role, however, is ever present. Otherwise (i.e. if cili were not ever active), even the body etc. would not be manifested i.e. would not appear as objects of consciousness). Therefore the practice

And thus : 

Sutra-16. When the bliss of cil is attained, there is lasting consciousness of identity with cit even in the body etc. which are experienced. This state is jivan mukti (i.e. mukti even while one is alive). 

Commentary 

On the attainment of the bliss of consciousness i... on the attainment of samovolil or contemplative experience of unity consciousness in which the entire universe is experienced as identical with the Self, there is firmness in the consciousness of identity with cit in body, prāna, blue, pleasurel etc. even when they are experienced like coverings i.e. there is lasting experience of unity consciousness with cit in vyutthanalla condiअवभिशावादयम् चिद कारम्पप्रतिपत्तिधामयम्'-अविचला, चिदकत्वप्रथा, सैव 'जीव न्मुक्तिः-जीवतः प्राणान् अपि धारयतो मुक्तिः प्रत्यभिज्ञातनिज स्वरूपविनाविताशेषपाशराशियात् । यथोक्तं स्पन्दशास्त्रे

tion also on account of the force of the impressions (left behind) of the unity --consciousness (produced) during contemplation which is strengthened by the various means to be propounded. That firmincs of consciousness of identity with cif is j u tri, i.c. liberation of one who is still alive i.e. who still rctains luis vital breaths, which i.e. liberation) is clue to the complete disolution of the fetters (of ignorance) on the recognition of one's truc nature. 

As has been said in the Spanda sastra (i. c. by Vasugupta in the Spanxlakirika, nisyanda IT, verse 5) "He who know this i.e. a k ril bellire this verse in Spandikärika) and regards the whole world as a play, (of the Divine), being ever united (with the universal conckus), in without doubt, liberated even while alive". 

How is the bliss of acquired ? Regarding this the Sūtrakāra (the composer of the sutras) sys :

Sutra---17. By the development of the madhya (centre) is there acquisition of the bliss of the ci. . 

The exalted Samvit (universal consciousness) itself is the centre inainuchas it is present as the innermost (reality)

of all and inasmuchas the form or nature of any thing what soever cannot be possible without its being attached to it (i.e. Samvit or universal consciousness) as the ground or support. In spite of its being so (i.e. in spite of its being the innermost reality and ground of every possible thing), accord ing to the dictum at first sanoit is transformed into prana", it conceals its real nature in the stage of Māyā and accepting the role of praña-sak/7,234 resting in the planes of buddhi, body etc. in a descending order, it has followed the counc of the thousand addis. Even there (i.e. at the stage of the individual embodiment) it remains principally in the form of the madhyama Ndi135 whose substratum is Brahman in the form of präna Jatti, right from brahmanandhraia down to adko-baktra137 like the central rib of a paláfala leaf. (It is called madhyama nädi or central nadi) because all the functions arise from that and come to rest there. Even though thus constituted, its nature remains hidden to the parts (i.e. the ignorant jivar). When, however, the exalted saatuit (consciousness) which, being the innermost reality of all forms the centre (madhya), develops by the process of the means described above (i.c.

by the practice117 of pancakriya) or when the central brahma 

di 140 develops14i as is to be described, then because of the development of that, there comes the attainment of the bliss of cit (the universal consciousness). Then comes liberation while one is alive as described before. 

With reference to the method which brings about the developrnent of the centre, it is said : 

Sutra-18. Herein the means are, dissolution of vikalpa, sankoca and vikāsa of sakti, cutting of the vahas, the practice of the contemplation) of the koti (point, extermity) of the beginning and the end etc. 

Commentary 

Hercin i.e. in the unfolding of the central fakti, the dis solution of vikalpa, etc. are the means. It has already been explained that the unfoldment of sambid which forms the centre of all is achieved by following the authorship of the five-fold process as already taught. However, inother means is also being mentioned. There is an easy means by which one can dispense with (lit. shatter) all the fetters of rigorous

disciplines like prandydma, 142 mudra, 24* bandha144 etc. When (an aspirant) keeps his citla (individual conscious ness) concentrated on the ramanid or cit (lit, heart)* restraining, by the method alluded to, the pikalpa 145 that obstruct staying in one's real nature, by not thinking of anything whatsoever, and thus by laying hold of dpitalpa state, he becomes used to the habit of regarding his cil as the (real) knower, untarnished by body ctc., and so within a short time only, he attains absorption into turya146 and the state transcending taryn (turyātita) 147 which are on the point of unfolding 

As has been said in Isvara-Pratyabhija, (IV A.I, ka, 11) By giving up rilalpa, and by one-pointedness of concentration), ont gradually reaches the stage of Medra-skip. 

'Hidaya' here does not mean the physical heart, but the decpest conscious nei. It hau been called 'hrdaya' or litert, because it is the centre of reality. It is the light of consciousness in which the entire universe is rooted. In the individual, it is the spiritual centre. 

$ Prof. Leidecker translate this in the following way : by becoming 

liberated from all sorrow whatsoever, he is banjishing wikapa which im pedei cheerfulness". How he has arrived at this interpretation pata all comprehension.

In excellent Spanda also (Spandakärikā, Ni. I, ka. 9) (it has been said) : 

When(mental) agitation would dissolve, then would ensue the high tatilage". 

So also in Jñana-garbha, (it has been said) : 

"When, O mother, men renounce all mental activities and are polsed in a pure Kate being free from the bondage of the pursuit of seanc-activities, then by thy grace is that supreme state realized at once which rains down the nectar of undiminishad w unparalleled lappiness". 

This means has been described first, because it is the highest and because it has been taught in the Pratyabhijna doctrine. The sankoca of Sakti etc., though not taught in the Pratyabhijña doctrine, have been, nevertheless, mentioned by us on account of their belonging to the sacred tradition 

Vimuktinukarana-kriyinussti-pirtantryalvalam" has been translated by Prof. Leidecker as their dependance ends in funt, because they devote themselves to the activity of the organ of those that are uyn." This is a deplorable sample of many such meaning lois translations with which the book is replete,

and their incidental connexion with it. If many means are described, some one may enter the state of sautāda) through Any one of them. The sarkoca of Sakti means turning in to wards the Self, by the process of withdrawal, of that conscious ness which is spreading externally through the gates of the senses (towards the objects). As has been said in the first mantra of the 4th chapter of Kathavalli belonging to the 

Atharu wanigads. 145

"The object (of one's atpiration) is to be won within, while the ex teralsight may be kept stowy without closing and opening of the eye-lids". 

This bhairavimudrad by means of absorption is external expansion. As has been said in kaksyāstotra. 

"Throwing by will all the power like sccing etc. simultaneously and on all sides into their respective objects and remaining (urmoved) withis like a gold pillar, you (O Śiva ) alonc appear u the foundation of the universe". 

Kallata, the great scholar has also said, "That i.e. the development of pikësa or madhya Sakti) is accomplished by transformation (i.e. by viewing the consciousness that considers itself as outgoing as the same that is inward) even in the pre

sence of forms* etc." The arikoca and vidāra of fakti cannote the practice of the condition of expansion and resting of Sakti in the stage of the Ordhua-Kundalini gradually brought about by the restraint of the prapa between the eye brows which (restraint) is accomplished by the power of the subtle prāna which develops gradually through the regulation of the vibrations in the cavities of the nosc. 

In the state of adhah kundalini i81 whose location is indi cated by the sixth organ of medkrakanda151 after strengthening the prāņa fakti, there is entrance or absorption in its root, tip and middle. As has been said in Vijfāna-bhattāraka (i.e. Vijñānabhairava, 68th verse) "One should throw (i. e. concentrate) the delightful citla in the middle of chi and sija153 whether by itself or permeated by ady priple breath), goe would them 

be joined to the bliss of sexual union". 

Herc bani represents the stage of sarikoca by the process of the entrance of prāna (in medhra-kanda). The pisal54 locus represents the stage of vitasa, by the technique of 

Prof. Leldecker translates "rupadio Marijimdi' is owing to the change in. form which is incorrect. The development of madlya-lakti is accomplish ed noi by change in form but by the transformation of consciousness.

of the twelve (a measure of twelve fingers) 168 Nibhalamat means exercise or practice by fixing the mind at the time of the rising of prära and its coming to an end between these two15° (i.e. between hşdaya and dvadasanta).

"He whose senses are increed ( nilinikph) in the ciher of the heart, who has entered mentally in to the centre of the heart-lotus, who excludes every thing cluc from consciousnes (i. e. who is one-pointed), attains to upranc happi nos, O Bekutiful one160. 

So also (has it been said in Vijñāna-bhairava, 51st verse). "If one turns one's mind to deadaldnt howmover and where over, the fluctuation of his mind will diminish every moment, and in a few days, he will acquire an extraordinary status", 

The word ādi i.e. et cetera refers to the practice of Murutra condition. As has been said in the Spanda (Spandakārika N. 3 Ka 9th). That is to be known as

Under this concept are also summed up the tasting etc. of beautiful objects. As is said in the excellent Vij Manabhai rava (72,79, and 74 verse). 

"When one experiences the expansion of the joy of savour arising from the pleasure of eating and drinking one should meditate on the perfect cond bon of this joy, and then one would become full of great bliss. 

What a jeg mentally become one with the incomparable joy of song and other objects, then of such i oncentrated pogle, there is identity with that (Le with the incomparable joy), because he becomes one with it. 

Wherever the fina (the individual mind) finds its satisfaction, let it be concentrated on that. In cvery such cast, the true nature of the high est blies will shine forth.362 

So also any other bhāvand (meditation) on the Self full of bliss may be inferred. The word, 'et cetera' in the saira refers to such methods for the development of the madhya (centre). 

From the development of the madhya results the attainment of the bliss of the spirit. This attainment of the bliss of the spirit) indeed is the samadki (at-one-ment) of the highest

In this process, there occurs, through the assimilation (lit., devouring) of the totality of the external sense-objects into the internal i.e. into the highest cili plane (the plane of highest or universal consciousness), penetration into the inner or samnāzveda by the very process of assiinilation, Again there occurs, through the internal i.c. through the realization of the nature of cirisaki by the power of saindea, 1 penetration or entrance into the external i.e. into the totality of sense-objects appearing as the this (idanta) by the process of externalization (vamana). This (pravesa or penetration or entrance) is (also) samāvesa of the nature of the manifestation of the solidification of the essence of cit 

(universal consciousness). 

His eternally active (nityodita) samāvvela, which is external and internal at the same time, is of the nature of mudra, because : 

(1) It distributes muda i. c. joy on account of its being 

Mudrais etymologically derived in three ways : () mudam rati (dnditi) i.e. thai which gives gud' or joy (a) mum drivayali i.e. that which dissolves me (boodigo) (3) mudrayall iti i.c. that which seals up (the univeric into urba).

It has been (rightly) said, "without its flashing, there is no flashing of anything (whatever)." Only while flashing in this manner, she by her mad-fakti appearing as of this or that nature owing to her assuming the nature (lit : colour) of manifested body, blue etc., (i.c. owing to her considering herself as the body, blue etc.), is considered by the māyā-subjects (i.c.

As has been said in Isvara-pratyabhijña, Jñānādhikara, VII Ahn. verse 1st).

"Owing to the maky-Inkii of the Lord, she herself having to do with different knowables is called knowledgs, ideation, resolution and by other miumcs." 

Thus it is one and the same cili - sakti in all conditions. When, as she unfolds, if by means of entry into and stability of it, she is attained, then by entering into her, and by the means previously described, i.e. by successive unfolding and infolding of the senses, because of cverything being of the nature of everything else, even in the re-absorption etc. of every thing, whatever group of natural consciousness-deities there is, c.g. the non-moyixa group of inner and external senses, which is ever projecting and ever withdrawing. Over all this the highest popin acquires lordship and parabhaira-ship (i.e. becomes the highest blairava). 

As has been said (in the Spandakirikin, 3rd Nisyanda, -19th verse). 

"When one is rooted into the one place i.c. into the Madera in consist ing of the perfect I-consciousness then controlling the diku (emanatlon) and lay (absorption) of it (i.c. of the prywaka or Sakpadarinthe "subtle body), one acquires the slalus of (real) njayer, and then 

becomes the lord of the Mtra (of the group of the sec-dcities)".

NOTES 

1. Recognition-This is the doctrine which teaches that the individual self (nara or jiva) is identical with the Universal Self (Siva). He has forgotten his Real Self owing to the limitations of his psycho-physical mechanism. The Saiva doctrine of Kashmir is called Pratyabhijña-darsana or the Philosophy of Recognition because it brings home to the individual the truth that once he recognises his Real Self, he will be free from his cgo-hood which is the product of his identification of himself with his psycho-physical mechanism, and will thus realize that his Real Self is identical with the Universal Self. 

This system is also known as Trika darlana i.e. the system of the triad., viz., (1) Nara, the bound Soul (2) Sakti the divine power and (3) Siva, the lord who releases the bound soul from his bondage. This is a mystic philosophy, describ ing all these three conditions. 

It is also called Spanda-Šāstra or the system of vibration, because it is to the vibrating energy or Sakti of Siva that the world-process owes its existence. 

2. Siva-This is derived from the root di (to lic), and from the root $vi (to cut asunder). Both these meanings arc implied in Siva. Siva is one 'in whom all things (viz., all objects and subjects) lie'. He is also one who cuts asunder (fyati papam illi Siwa) all sins. Siva is thus both the funda mental ground of all reality and the supreme Benevolence or Good who by His grace saves all. He is the supreme or Absolute both from the metaphysical and soteriological point of view. The name Siva for the Highest Reality is therefore, a very happy choice. Siva is the Highest Reality as well as the Highest Good. 

In addition to Pratyabhijia, Trika, and Spanda, this system is also known as Saiva-darsana or Bhairava-darsana 

106 

PRATYADINAHRDAYA i.c., the system positing Siva as the all-of-reality-and good. As this system is non-dual, it is sometimes called Kashmirian Saiva philosophy in order to distinguish it from the Saiva philosophy of the South which is dual. 

3. Satatam-enternally may be read with \#amah or with pancakralya-vidhayine. In the former case, it would mean 'my eternal adoration to Siva'. In the latter case it would mean "my adoration to Siva who eternally brings about the five processes'. The latter construction is better as it indicates that Siva's activity is incessant. 

. 4. Pancakpty or the five acts brought about by Siva are - 

(1) Sri-Letting go; casting out of oneself. The usual translation "creation' is misleading. Creation implies that the creator acts upon an external material, and thus brings about the world-process. This translation does not do justice to the Indian point of view, particularly to the point of view of Saiva philosophy. Srsti is derived from the root "sj" which means to let go', 'to pour forth', 'to cast out'. This implies that the world-process is already implicitly contai ned in Siva. He only lets it go or casts it out of himself. He has not to work on an external material in order to bring about the world-process. According to Saiva philosophy, the world is not a creation, but an emanation, it is a theophany. 

(2) Sthiti-maintenance of the world-process). 

(3) Samhāra or Samhrti --withdrawal or re-absorption. It does not mean destruction. There is no destruction of the world. It is only re-absorbed by Siva for a time. Destruc tion is only a metaphorical and secondary sense of samihdra, not its primary sense. 

(4) Vilaya or pidhāna-conccalment of the real nature of the Self. 

(5) Anugraha-grace. 

These five krlepas imply that Siva lets go the universe out of himself, imparts existence to it and finally withdraws it into himself only to let it appear again. This makes a cycle which is called a kalpa. There is no final end to the world 

NOTES 

107 process. The cosmic process is repeated from cternity to eternity. 

Artugraha is the act of grace by which Siva brings about the liberation of man. The first four triyas are cosmological, the last is soteriological. The five krtyas are not an artificial mixture of two standpoints--one cosmological and the other soteriological. Rather anugraha is the raison d'etre of the first four krbyas, it is that for the sake of which the first four krtxas come into play. It expresses the abounding love of Siva. 

5. Paramartha-Parama+artha : Parama means the Highest; "artha' means both 'reality and goal or value'. Paramārtha connotes both the Highest Reality and the Highest value. According to Indian thought, the Highest Reality is also the Highest Value of man. In the realization of the Highest Reality consists the meaning and purpose of human life. 

6. Sudima may mean either one's nature or one's self. In the former case, the line "cidanandaghama-seda-paramarthe bhāsand would mean "wlio makes manifest the Highest Reality (which is at the same time the Highest Value) whose Nature is cidana daghara i.c., a mass of consciousness and bliss or compact consciousness and bliss. In the latter case, it would mean who makes manifest the Highest Reality (which is at the same time the Highest Value), viz., His Self (which is also the Real Self of cach individual) that is a mass of cons ciousness and bliss". There is a double entendre in 'svätma' viz., His Self (the self of Siva) and the self of each individual the implication being that His Self is indentical with the Real Self of each. This translation is preferable, as it is more in line with the general tenor of this system. 

7. Cidänandaghana-mass of consciousness and bliss. In Sankara Vedānta, the expression used is generally 'sacci dānanda" i.e., sa! (existence ) cił (consciousness) and äranda (bliss). In this system, "sat" has been dropped as super fluous, for according to it, cit or consciousness alonc is sat or real. Cit and sat-consciousness and existence or reality are synonymous. There can be nothing outside consciousness 

10g 

RRATYADHIJNAHRDAYA which may be called existent or real. Sankara also says, 

Sat eva bodha, bodha eva satta 1.6., Existence itself is cons ciousness, and consciousness itself is existence. 

8. Upanisat-up-ni-sad (sit) i.e. sitting down near to or sitting down at the fect of another (i.c., the teacher) to listen to his words. It, therefore, has come to mean "rahasya' or secret knowledge obtained in this manner. It is equivalent to secret or esoteric doctrine. The word has also been inter preted by Sankara as "destruction (of ignorance) by reveal ing the knowledge of the supreme spirit'. Here the word has been used in the sense of 'secret or esoteric doctrine'. 

• 9. Samkara-'Sam Karoti iti Samkarah' one who brings about happiness and welfare is Sarkara. This is another name of Siva. Samkaropanial, therefore, means the esoteric doctrine pertaining to Sarnkara or Siva i.e., the esoteric system known as Saiva philosophy. 

10. Samsara-Samsarati it sansärah i.c., that which is always on the move';that which is continuous "pro-cess'. The word 'world' or universe' can hardly do justice to this idea. Etymologically the word "samudra' also means 'wander ing through' (a succession of states) of the jioa or the individual soul. It is in this sense that 'sowadra' is called "pia" or poison here. It is not the world a world which is poison, but the "wandering through of the jiva as a being disintegrated from Reality, cut off from his Innermost Centre, which is poison. 'Visa' is derived from the root "pija' of the third conjugation (weer). meaning 'to pervade', hence anything actively pernicious i.c., poison. The root vis' in the fourth conjugation ( 

van) means also "to separate, to disjoin'. There may be a suggestion here that "sansara' is 'ia' because it disjoins us, disintegrates us from Siva-(the Highest Reality). 

11. Samiada--This is the noun form of "san-d-vi?", meaning to enter into. Samdeca, therefore, means mergence or identification. Samdala with the Highest Lord means identification of the individual Self with the Universal Self. The individual, in this state, feels that he is nothing else than 

NOTES 

109 

Siva. Samo da, also means taking possession of the individual by the Divine. The outcome is the same, viz., identification with Siva. According to Abhinavagupta, defa means the subordination or disappearance of the personal nature of the aspirant and his identification with the divine nature of Siva. 

"Avelasca asvatantrasya svatadrupānimaijanät. Para tadrupatā Sambhorādyācchaktyavibhäginah" Tantraloka I volume I Ähnika, Verse--173. 

12. Satti is the energy of Sia, and, therefore, not different from him. With this, he brings about parcia or the five cosmic processes. Satti-pata means the descent of Salti. Saxti-pta on an individual means the imparting of anugraha or grace to him. 

13. Sötra-Lit., 'thread'; hence, it has come to mean that which like a thread runs through or holds together cer tain ideas; a rule, a formula; a direction. Cp. Latin, ulura, English, suure

14. Shalanira-this is an adjective qualifying Citi. This means dependent only on itself and nothing else. It means that it is absolved of all conditions, and is free to do anything it likes. The word Svatantra, has therefore, been rendered by two words; viz., alysolute, and of its own free will. 

15. CiThis means "universal consciousness and is feminine gender in Sanskrit. Citi and Cit are synonymous. They are distinguished from citta which means 'individual consciousness". 

16. Siddhi-means effectuation which includes (1) prakasana or srsti-emanation (2) sthiti--maintenance of what is emanated, and (3) faithdra, withdrawal or re-absorption. 

17. Sada fiddeh blünyantasya-- from Sadasiva down to the earth. According to this system, there are 96 Mas or principles. These are divisible into two; viz., the Suddha adhod, the pure or the supramundane way or course and the afuddha110 

PRATYABHI NAHRDAYA adhai or the impure i.e. the mundane way or course. The 36 Allows are given below in a dexoending order from Siva, the Supreme principle. 

Above manifestation 

1. Siva, the Highest Principle or universal consciousness. 

In this, cit or consciousness is predominant. 2. Sakti, Siva's inseparable conscious energy. In this 

ananda or bliss is predominant. 

** 

Suddha addhva or Supramundans manifestation 

3. Sadasiva i.c. the ever benevolent. In this fatwa aharla 

or I-consciousness and icchi or Will are predominant. Idanti or this-consciousness (i.c. world-consciousness ) is not so prominent. The world is in an indistinct state 

at this stage. 4. Távara, i.e. the Lord. In this both I-consciousness and 

world-consciousness are equally prominent, and jina 

or knowledge is predominant. 5. Vidyā or Sudhavidya or Sadvidya pure, unlimited 

knowledge. In this there is the consciousness-This (universe) am I, and kriyā or action is predominant. The first five--from Siva to Sadvidya-are called Suddha talia, because the relationship of subject and object is a single unit upto this stage i. e. the object is per ceived as a part of the subject. These five tattvas represent the universal aspect of consciousness. 

Akuddha addhyā or mundane manifestation 

6. Māya, the universally formative or limiting principle. 

Sometimes, this is not included in the Kancukas, as it is a principle superior to the Kañcukas. This veils the real Sell and brings about the consciousness of different 

objects. 7. Kalā, i.e. limitation in respect of authorship or efficacy. 8. Vidyā, knowledge i.c. limitation in respect of knowledge. 

NOTES 

111 

9. Raga, inclination, limitation in respect of desire, e.g. 

I may enjoy this, I may own that etc. 10. Kāla i.e. limitation in respect of time, division of past, 

present, and future. 11. Niyati-Restriction i.e. limitation in respect of space 

and cause. 12. Puruşa-when the Divine by his Mayā veils His real 

Self and accepts the status of a limited experient, he is known as Puruş. At this stage the Sarvakurtstva or omnipotence of the Divine is reduced to kala or limited authorship, His sarvajMatva or omniscience is reduced to vidyā or limited knowledge; His pürnatva or all fulfilment is reduced to rāga or want and desire; His nityatva or eternity is reduced to käla or time-division; His vyāpakatva or omnipresence or all-pervasiveness is reduced to niyati or limitation in space or His svātantrya is reduced to cause-effect relationship. From Kalā to Niyati is generally known as the five kañcukas or cover 

ings, veils of Māyā put on by the Divine. Prakrti-the root or matrix of objectivity from Buddhi 

down to earth. 14. Buddhi, the ascertaining intelligence. 15. Ahamkära, the ego-making principle. 16. Manas, the conceptive consciousness. 17-21. The five jñanendriyas or organs of perception (audi 

tion, touch, vision, taste, and smell). 22-26-The five organs of action (karmendriyas) 27-31 --The five farmatras i.e. the undifferentiated origins of 

the five perceptions. 32-36-The five mahabhūtas the gross-elements, viz., akafa 

(ether), vāyu (air), agni (fire), apas (water) and bhumi (carth). 

ALL 

18. Parapramat means the Highest Experient. Pramāts means measurer or the subject of experience. The highest 

experient is parama-Siva, the highest Siva. . 19. Parafakti--the highest Sakti. This is distinguished 

112 

PRATYABHIJNAHRDAYA 

from the subsidiary faktis that pervade the universe and bring about all kinds of things. They are various aspects of the highest Sakri. Sakti means divine consciousness or conscious energy which is non-distinct from Siva. It is Siva himself in his active aspect of manifestation and grace. 

20. Vimarša-Vi +mss. The root "mrs' means to touch. "Vimps' means to touch mentally. It is a highly technical term of this system. Paramasiva, the ultimate reality is not only prałdia or luminous consciousness, but also vimarśa i.c. conscious of its consciousness. Vimarla is Self-conscious ness or pure I-consciousness of the highest Reality. It is this vimarśa or self-consciousness of reality that brings about the emergence of the universe (srsti), its manifestation (sthiti) and its withdrawal (simhara) into it again as identical with its joy of pure I-consciousness. vimarśa assumes three moments, viz., going out of itself (srsti), manifesting its conti nued existence (sthiti) and then returning to itself (samhāra) cf. "Iha khalu parmesvarab prakāfitma; prakāgasca vimarśa svabhāvab: vimargo nám visvākārena, visvaprakasanena, visvasam haranena ca akstrimāham iti visphuranam" - Para-Prävesika, pp 1-2, Kashmir Sanskrit Scrics. The entire universe is already contained in the highest conscious ness or the highest Self even as the variegated plumage of the peacock is already contained in the plasmit of its egg (mayu rändarasa-nyayena). Vimar is the positing of this Self which leads to manifestation. 

21. Siva-bhattaraka-The word "Warrdraka' is the same As 'Shatlara' which again is the same as the word 'bhatta'. The word bhalla is derived from blarer-lord. The word bharidra or bladdrata means venerable lord. This has been attached to Siva to show reverence. 

22. Nityadita-In this system it is generally not the word nitya (eternal) that is used for the foundational consciousness, but nityodita i.c. cver-risen, ever-existent. It is so, because the system wants to emphasize the fact that the eternal conscious ness is ever active; there is always spanda or vibration in it. ..:23. Pramair (lit, measurer), subject of knowledge. 

NOTES 

113 

24. Praman (lit., instrument of knowledge) means of knowledge, proof. 

25. Pramod (lit., to be measured, measurable) the known or object of knowledge. 

26. Baidari kala—parah pramātā. Vetti iti vinduh (binduh) from the root vid (to know) The highest Sell or consciousness which is the knower is known as Bindu. Bindoriyam ili baindavi. Baindai means of bindu', 'pertaining to bindu". Kala means sukti. Baindavī kall means the power of knowership of the highest Self or consciousness. Here it means that power of the Self by which it is always the subject, never the object. 

27. Samarasa-one having the same feeling or conscious ness. Sámarasya therefore, means identity of consciousness. 

28. Swatantra-Citi or the divine consciousness is called spalanira, because whether it is srsti (manifestation), sthiti (maintenance of the manifestation), samudra (withdrawing or reducing to oneness with herself), she is sovereign i.c. does not depend upon any extraneous condition. 

29. Pramānoprokatramn, by gradual mounting, begin ning with knowledge etc. From the known or pramga one has to mount to pramina or knowledge; from knowledge, one has to mount to the pramātā or the knower to the highest Self. 

30. Brahmavada (the doctrine of Brahman) refers to Sankara-Vedānta in which Brahiman is said to be nonactive. 

31. Darpare nagarapat-Just as a city appearing in a mirror is nothing different from the mirror, but appears as something different, even so the universe appearing in citi is nothing different from it, though it appears as different. 

32. Sadasiva la fie may be said to be the first principle of manifestation. Out of the Siva-sakti state emerges Seda Siva tation where consciousness is of the form, 'I am this". "This" (idantā) here refers to the total universe. I (ahanta) refers to the Divine Experient. It is the absolute or universal I. The first consciousness of the absolute in manifestation is, 'I am this". The 'this' (idantā) or the entire universe is already implicity contained in the absolute consciousness, but when it 

114 

PRATYABHIJRAHỘDAYA begins to posit the I as the 'this, the "this" becomes the first glimmer of the universe to be. This is, however, a stage of consciousness where the 'this' aspect is in an incipient, germinal form, greatly dominated by the 'I' aspect ahantācchädita asphuta-idantāmayam), where the silva or universe is both different and non-different (parāpara rūpam) from Sadā Siva. In the consciousness, "I am this", existence or being is clearly posited; hence this principle is also known as sādākhya tattva (Sat-Being). The system now starts giving a hierarchy of individual experients. Corresponding to the universal experient or Sadā-Siva is the individual (mystic) experient, designated mantramalsara, who has realized Sadd-fiva falta and whose experience is, therefore, of the form-'I am this'. 

33. Iwa-tation is the next stage of manifestation in which the consciousness of an 'I' and a 'this is both equally promi nent. The ideal universe which is involved in the absolute consciousness becomes more clearly defined as a "this' at this stage. Jiana is predominant in this totta. Corresponding to this is the individual (mystic) experient known as Mantre Svara who has realized the Itara-tatiba, whose consciousness is also of the form 'I am this', in which the universe is no longer an indistinct 'this', but is as clearly defined as the conscious ness of 'T', and in which the universe is identical with the Self. The consciousness of Sadasiva is Ahamidam'-'I am this". The consciousness of Isvara is 'Idamaham-'This am I." 

34. Vidyā or Suddha Vidyā is the stage when the cons ciousness of both 'T' (the experient) and the 'this' (the universe) is distinct, and where diversity or bheda begins, though there is unity in diversity at this stage. Kriyd is predominant in this tattua. Coresponding to this, there are the experients called Mantras who see diversity, though it is diversity-in-unity. The Lord who rules over these experients is called Anantabhattāraka. The consciousness of this stage is "Idam-Idam', 'Aham-Aham', the universe is just the universe, the Self is just the Selfi.c. the universe is totally distinct from the Self (though it may still belong to Self). 

35. Vijnanakala is the experient of the stage below 

NOTES 

115 

Suddha Vidya but above Mayi. Here the experient is devoid of agency; he is pure awareness. His field of experience consists of sakalas, and pralayakalas. He has i sense of identity with his field of experience (tadabhedasáram). 

36. In this state, the experient has neither the clear consciousness of aha (I) nor of idam (this). His I-con sciousness is identical with a void like the void that one experiences in deep sleep. He has the feeling of a vague some thing which is practically nothing. 

37. The satalar are the devar (gods) and jiovar (indivi dual selves) who have no truc knowledge of Self, and where consciousness is only that of diversity. The average human being belongs to this level. 

38. The suggestion is that in this state marfa is latent; only prahaga is predominant. 

We may now gather up in a tabular form the details of the third sutra :

7. The re 

maining tativas upto the the earth. 

From Vijäänākala upto Sakala, there is no presiding deity, because the operation of Mahāmāya begins from the stage of Vijdanakala and also becausc ignorance begins from the Mahāmāyā stage. 

39. Anätrita-Siva-paryaya' - amărrita i.c. unrelated to any thing: lit., whose synonym is Siva who has no objective content yet. This is a state below Saktitattva and above Sadā-Siva-tattva. This, however, is only an avastha, a state, not a tattva. This refers to that phase of reality where Sakti begins temporarily to veil the Self, and thus to isolate the universe from itself producing aklati ignorance of its real nature. 

40. Sandris enyalay-being as yet more void than the void itself. It is called Sünya here from the point of view of objective manifestation, from the standpoint of the negation of the universe, i.e. from the point of view of absence of objective content or objectivity 

41. Sarpadeamaya kayah--the universe is considered to be like a body constituted by all the gods. The gods here symbolize both the pramata and the prameya, all the subjects and objects-the experients and the experienced. Another reading is Sarva-tattva-mayaḥ kāyah--the body of the universe is constituted by all the taldeas. 

NOTES 

117 

42. Pript-dear one or my dear. The Agama literature is generally in the form of a dialogue between Siva and his consort Parvati. Hence, Priye"-0, dear one. 

43. Trisiromale--the mystical doctrines concerning the three-headed Bhairava. The three heads of god, Bhairava are a symbolic representation of the three Saktis of the Divine, viz., Para, Parapara, and Aparl. The Pară is the supreme state in which there is no distinction or difference whatsoever between Siva and Sakti. Parapară is that state of manifes tation) in which there is identity-in-distinction. Apară is that state in which there is complete difference. 

44. Bhairava means the terrible one who destroys the weakness of the lower self. This is the name of Siva. Bhairava is constituted of three letters, bha, ra, and va. The hermeneutic interpretation of Bhairava, therefore, is that 'bha' indicates 'bharana-manitenance of the universe 'ra" indicates "ravana' - i.e., withdrawal of the universe, 'va' indicates "vamana' ejecting or letting go of the universe, i.c., manifestation of the universe. Thus, Bhairava indicates all the three aspects of the Divine, viz., STsti (manifestation), sthiti (maintenance) and Samhara (withdrawal). 

45. It has not yet been possible to trace the source of this verse. The idea in this verse is expressed in the form of a paradox. But what does 'akhyati'-nescience or non-knowledge mcan? Does it appear or not? In other words-is it ex perienced or not? If akhyati is never experienced, then it is nothing, and only krydre or knowledge remains. If it is said that akhyati is also a kind of khyāti, then khyati or knowledge again remains. So khyati or knowledge cannot be eliminated in any case. 

46. The reference is to Spandakārikā, chapter II, verses 3 and 4. 

47. Vikalpa means difference of perception; an idea as different from other ideas; differentiation. Vikalpanam (Visegena kalpanam)=ideating a "this' as different from that', differentiation-making activity of the mind. Vikalpa is the nature of the individual mind (citta) 

118 

PRATYABHIJRAURDAYA which goes on making differentiation between one thing and another. Compare the vivști of Yogaraja on verse II of Parmärthasära of Abhinavagupta, "Vikalpoli arvāpohak-lakyano dosyam ghataghatar pam akipan, aghatát adekinnan ghatam nifcinoti' P, 33, i.c., pikalpa is of the nature of differentiating one thing from another. For instance dividing experience into jar and non-jar, it marks out the jar from the non-jar, and thus ascertains it as a jar. In Yoga-Sutra of Patanjali, (Sūtra 9 of Samādhi-Päda). Vikalna mean a mere fancy which has no foundation in reality. That is not the meaning here. 

48. Citta means the individual consciousness. . 49. Vijfānākala-See note 35. 

50. Vidyapramatptă-the experients of vidyā-tattva i.e. Mantra, Mantreśvitra and Mantramahesvara. 

51. Iša, Sadasiva, Anāśrita-siva, Sec notes 32, 33 and 39. 

52. Siva Sakti, Sadasiva, Isvara, and Suddhavidyā are together known as Suddhādhvathe pure or higher path. Predominance of cit is common to both Vidyāprama tāras and Suddhadhva-prämätāras, but in the former case it is natural, whereas in the latter, it is acquired through the effort of Samīdhi. 

53. Sünya--pramatr, etc. See note 36. 

54. The meaning of the verse is what is jdäna in the case of Siva appears as safioa in the case of pasu' or jina (the individual), what is kroyd in the case of Siva (the universal, Absolute Consciousness) appears as rajas in the individual, what is may in the case of Siva appears as tamas in the individual. 

55. Sativa, rajas, and tamas are the three gwar which are the chief characteristics of Praksti, the root principle of manifestation. This has been elaborately described by Sankhya, and accepted by practically all systems of Hindu philosophy. Guna meáns strand, a constituent, an aspect of Prakrti. Satta is the aspect of harmony, goodness, enlighten ment, and sutha or pleasure. Rajas is the aspect of movement, activity, and duhkha or commotion. Tamas is the aspect of inertia, and mila or dullness, indifference. 

56. Vikalpa-See note 47.

57. Máyäpramāte is the experient of the impure path the sphere of limitation. Māyāpramāts includes pralaydkalas and sakalas. See notes 36 and 37, and the tabular form given there. 

58. Sudlanirya is the abstract noun of Satandra which means one's own rule, not conditioned by any thing outside oneself. It is the absolute, spontancous, free will of the divine consciousness, outside the causal chain, the free, creative act of the Universal consciousness. 

59. Mala : dust, dirt, impurity, taint; drog. Dross is the best English equivalent. Mala is what covers and conceals the pure gold of divine consciousnes. It is of three forms, viz., īnava mala, mayiya mala, and kārma mala. As used in this system, mala means those cosmic and indivi dualistic limiting conditions which hamper the free expression of the spirit. 

Anam-mala is the mala-wald, the primary limiting condition which reduces the universal consciousness to an aņu, a small, limited entity. It is a cosmic limiting condition over which the individual has no control. It is owing to this that the jimi (individual soul) considers himself apürna, imperfect, a separate entity, cut off from the universal consciousness. The greatness of Siva in this condition is concealed, and the individual forgets his real nature. 

Mayiyamala is the limiting condition brought about by maya, that gives to the soul its gross and subtle body. It is also cosmic. It is bhinna-wedya-pratha--that which brings about the consciousness of difference owing to the differing limiting adjuncts of the bodies. 

Karina-Fala. It is the vāsanas or impressions of actions done by the jnanendriyas and karmendriyas under the influence of antahkarana. It is the force of these basaras that carries him from one life to another. 

It may be noted that Vijßänäkala has only anava mala, Pralayākala has two, viz, āņava and mayiya mala, and Sakala has all the three viz, anava, mayiya, and kārma mala. 

60. Sanya--the 'Void" is the field of experience of the pralya-kevali, See note 36.PRATYABIDJÑAURDAYA 61. Puryasjaka-Literally, the city of eight, refers to the subtle body consisting of the five laivālras (1. c., the fundamental undifferentiated essence of the five gross elements) mamas, buddhi, and charkdra. It is also known as sikmalarira or linga-sarira which is the vehicle of the Forskaras. 

62. Upadhi (up+-+dha) lit., some thing placed near, which affects or limits a thing without entering into it as its constituent. 

63. Sugata (lit., one who has fared well) is a title of the Buddha. Therefore his followers are known as Saugatas.. 

64. The Madhyamikas are the followers of the madhya maka (the system of the middle way) school of philosophy. *They believe in fünya (lit., void) as the fundamental principle. 

65. The Pāñcarātra or Bhagavata system is the main philosophy of Vaišnavaism. On the origin of Pancarätra, soe Sir R.G. Bhandarkar's "Vaišnavaism, Saivism and Minor Religions systems". The derivation of the word, Paicarátra is somewhat obscurc. Perhaps it refers to some religions rites lasting for five nights. The followers of Pāficarátra are here called Pancarätras. 

66. The word "prakti" here does not mean the Prakrti or root-matter of the Sankhyas. Para prakrti here means the highest cause. The followers of Påficarātra system consider Vasudeva both as the material cause and controlling cause of all manifestation. 

67. Leidecker believes that pariņāma here does not mean transformation or change, but the Pāficarātras considered järvas, etc. to be the pariņāma or transformation of Vasudeva. Sankara while criticizing the Pāficarätra system in his com mentary on Brahmasūtra in Utapatti-asambhavādhi karanam put its position quite clearly and correctly. - "Teşam Vasudevah pard prakrtir-itare sankarşanādayah 

68. Kshmerāja seems to have made some confusion here. The Páscarătras do not consider "apakla" (non-manifest) as the ultimate source, but Vasudeva who is higher than 

NOTES 

121 cuyakla". Sankara puts their position quite correctly in his commentary on Brahmasūtras, in Utpatti-asambhavādhi karanan. " Ed AT 14: TTATT ufuc: परमात्मा सरिमा स आत्मनात्मानमन कषा व्यू हावस्थित इति, तन्ना निराक्रियते" 

69. "Sankhyas" here means the followers of Sanklya" 70. See note 32. 

71. The Vaiyakaranas were the followers of the Grammar School of Philosophy that considered grammar as means of spiritual liberation. Their philosophy has been described under the heading "Panini-darsanam" in Sarva-dar fana-Sangraha". by Madhava. 

72-73. The philosophy of Vyakarana considers the Absolute or Highest Reality as Sabda-brahman." Sabda (word) is to them not something unconscious but consciousness itself where thought and word coalesce and are not yet dis tinguished. Brahman is the eternal word from which ema nates everything. According to the Trika system, the universe of objects and so also of thoughts and words is always in Parama Sivá potentially. This is the stage of the Parāvāc-tbe highest word which is yet unmanifest. The next stage is that of Pasyanti which is the divine view of the universe in its un differentiated form, far beyond human experience. Kshema raja means to say that the grammarians go only as far as payanti but not upto Parāvāc. After the payanti, there is the madhyamd, which marks the next stage of the mani. festation of the universe from undifferentiated mass to differentiated particulars. Madhyama, lit., the middle one is thus a link between Paśyanti, the vision of the undifferentiated universe, and Vaikhari, the stage of differentiated particular, the stage of empirical thought and speech. It is word in a subtle form in the mind or antahkarana. 

74. The agamas (here, Saiva-Agamas) refer to a group of literature containing the doctrine of the Saivas. *Agama' means tradition, that which is handed down from generation to generation. 

75. By Arhatas (the deserving, the dignified) is here meant the Jains. They maintain that the universe consists of 

122 

PRATYABHNAHRDAYA 'paramānus' (atoms of matter) which are eternal. They are subject to change or development in-as-much-as they assume different guras (qualities). The Agama quoted means to suggest that Jains consider these gunar as the highest reality they have discovered and are unable to go further than the 

76. The followers of "tantra' are known as tantrikas. The word "tantra" has been explained in two ways, 

(1) from the root 'tan' to expand that in which the principles of reality are expanded, are elaborately described is "tantra". 

(2) "from the root "tantra" to control, to govern--that which teaches how to control the various forces of reality is "tantra". 

77. "Kula' here means "Sakti' (the divine manifesting power). The reference here is obviously to the Saktas, the worshippers of Sakti. 

78. Vidya is one of the five Kañcukas-the impure knowledge afuddha-vidyā). It is the principle of limitation which does not allow the individual to have a synoptic view of reality. .: 79. Turiya, the fourth state of consciousness. Micro cosmically, it is the fourth state of consciousness holding to gether the waking (jägrat), dreaming (Svapna) and dreamless sleep (suşupti). Macro-cosmically, it is the fourth state hold ing together the three krtyals of srsti, sthiti, and samhära. "Srsti-sthiti-samhāra-melan-rūpa-iyam turiyā". Just as a string holds together various flowers in a garland, even so it holds together the other three forms of experience and runs through them all. It is integral awareness. But it is other than the three states of waking, dream and sleep. Hence it is called the fourth. When an individual consciously experiences turiyā state, the sense of difference disappears. 

80. For any and mala, see note 59.

The whole idea of the limitation of the powers of Siva may be expressed in a tabular form: 

Sakti as existing in Siva 

Sakti as existing in the 

- limitation of man 

1. Sarvakartītvaomnipotence Kala- limited authorship or 

efficacy. 2. Sarvajiatva-omniscience Vidya-limitation in respect 

of knowledge. 3. Pürnatva or Nitya-tripti Rīga-limitation in respect perfection or fullness of desire, i.e., desiring this or 

that particular. 4. Nityatva-eternity Kala-limitation in respect of 

time. 5. Vyäpakatya or Svatantrya Niyati-limitation in respect 

- all pervasiveness or freedom of space and cause. 

85. "Isvaradvaya-dardana" means the system of philosophy which does not belier in any other principle (adwaya) than Isvara, the Lord. This is the characterization of the Saiva philosophy of Kashmir which maintains that Siva is the whole and sole reality. There is 'no second' (advaya), i.e., no other principle than Siva. He appears both as the world or the field of experience and the experient. 

86. Brahmavādins refers to the Vedantists. Literally, it means advocates of the Brahman doctrine. 

87. Panica-vidha-krtya---the five-fold act. For details See note 4. In Sūtra 10, the five-fold act is described from the epistemological point of view. 

88. Suddhetara-adhvā= (lit.), (course other than the intrinsic) i.c., the aśuddhādhvã, the non-intrinsic course, the extrinsic manifestation. Suddhādhvă is the intrinsic or supramundane manifestation; aśuddhadhvá is the mundane or extrinsic manifestation. Sadasiva, Isvara, and Suddhavidyā are in the region of Suddha-adhvá or supra 

PRATYA DHIJRAHEDAYA mundane manifestation. The Lattras from māya to the five gross clements are in the region of asuddha-adhvā, the extrinsic course or mundane manifestation. 

89. This is called 'vilaya", because the real nature of self is veiled in this state. 

90. In the matter of knowledge, the object known in a way becomes one with the knowing subject. The actual praniti (knowledge), divested of the accidents, of the pramea (the known object), will be found to be one with the promāls 

(the knowing subject). i 91. Here the five-fold act is described particularly from 

the point of view of the esoteric experience of the yogin. , 

92. Vimarama or cámattára is the experience of "Ah ! I know this'. It is like the delight of an artistic experience; hence it is called canatkara' which means an intuitive flash of artistic experience. 

93. The knowledge of the object is called sawthara here, because the object is withdrawn. "The object as an object disappears and only its knowledge remains. 

94. Hathapaka: There are two ways by means of which an object of experience is brought to sameness with the real essence of the experient, viz., (1) iduti-pralama and (2) Avhapaka prafame. The first one is a slow, gradual process; the second, i.c., hathapäka is a dogged, persistent process. It is not gradual. 

95. Alangrāsa: alan terasa alat means parip Ornar ida-- toyd, nis-samskärataya, i.e., fully perfectly, when no impression or germ of samsara as separate from consciousness is allowed to remain; grära is grasanam (lit., swallowing)--here it means svatmasätkaranam-bringing it to sameness with the Self. 

96. Mantras : Mantra is a sacred word or words which, when uttered and meditated upon, become efficacious in all sorts of ways ; here in bringing about liberation).

101. Avitalpa is the distinction-less consicousness. It is the opposite of vikalpa. It is mere awareness withont a 'this', or that'. 

102. Brāhmi, lit., means pertaining to Brahma. The other faktis are, Mahesvari, Kaumäri, Vaisnavi, Värāhi, Indrāni, and Camundā. 

103. The idea is that so long as the soul is in the paru (bound) stage, the faktir cause to appear the seat and shiti-the emanation and maintenance of beda or difference only, and sandra or complete disappearance of abheda or non-difference or one-ness. At this stage, consciousness of difference is created and maintained, and consciousness of oneness is completely withdrawn. At the pati stage, when bondage of the soul dissolves, the reverse of the previous condition lappens. Here the faktir bring about si and sthiti, emanation and maintenance of abheda, non-difference : or one-ness of all, and sawthara or complete withdrawal of bhede or difference. Pati stage is of two kinds-(1) auddi siddha eternally present as in the case of Siya and (2) Togi dald-that which appears at the stage of yogin. It is the latter which is meant by padi-dard herc. Prof. Leidecker has given a very fantastic interpretation of this. See note 173, pp. 138-39 of his translation. The text has been completely misunderstood by him here. 

104. Bhairavindra Bhairava-mudra has been defined thus : 

अन्तर्लक्ष्यो बहिष्टिनिमेषो मेषवजितः 

इयं सा भैरवीमुद्दा सर्वतन्वेषु गोपिता । This is a kind of psycho-physical condition brought about by the following practice : 

"Attention should be turned inwards; the gaze should be turned outwards, without the twinkling of the eyes. This is the mudra pertaining to Bhairava, kept secret in all the Tantras." 

126 

PRATYAVIJNAHRDAYA 105. Suddha (pure) vitalba-This is the vikalpa in which the Sadhaka feels -"Sarvo mamāyam vibhavah"-all this glory of manifestation is of (my) Self in which he identifies himself with Siva. It is a total consciousness and the means for passing into Hirvikalpa or consciousness free from differentiations. This is why it is called Suddha vitala. . 106. Mahefald-This is an abstract noun of "Mahua" which means the great Lord (Siva). Mahesati or Māhes Varya, therefore, means the power or status of the great Lord, Siva. It connotes the state in which the soul is perfected and identified with Maheta, the great Lord or Siva. 

107. Vikalpas-See note 47. 

108. Vanušvari -The author here gives the reason as to why this fakti is known as put foari. The word wave is connected with the verb (am' which means 'to spit out, emit, cject". The Sakti is called Vämešvari, because she emits or sends forth the universe out of the Absolute. The word bama also means 'left, reverse, contrary, opposite". This fakti is called Väme vari also because while in the Siva state there is unity-consciousness, in the state of Sansira, the contrary or opposite condition happens, viz., there is difference--conscious ness, and also because every one considers the body, prāna, etc., to be his Self. This play on the word dam cannot be retained in the translation. 

109. Khecari, gori, ditcari and bhari are only sub species of Vāmešvari Sakti. Khecari is connected with the prandid, the empirical subject, the limited experient; gocari is connected with his dla fikarana, the inner psychic apparatus; ditcari is connected with the baxişkarana, the outer senses; bh dari is connected with the badoas, existents or outer objects. These fattis indicate the processes of the objectification of the universal consciousness. By khecari fakti, one is reduced from the position of an all-knowing consciousness to that of limited experient; by gocari fakti, he becomes endowed with an inner psychic apparatus, by dikeari fakti, he is endowed with outer senses; by bhncari, he becomes confined to blības or external objects. 

NOTES 

127 

Khecari is one that moves in khaor akafa. Kha or data is, herc, a symbol of consciousness. The fakti is called thecari, because her sphere is tha or consciousness. Gocari is so called, because her sphere is the inner psychic apparatus. The saruksta word '20" indicates move ment, and thus light-rays, cow, senses are known as 'o', because they are connected with movement. The anlahkerana is the scat of the senses and sets them in motion; it is the dynamic apparatus of the spirit par excellence. Hence it is said to be the sphere of gocarl. Dikcari is literally the fakti that moves in dik or space. The outer senses have to do with the consciousness of space. Hence the outer senses are said to be the sphere of dikcarl. The word be in bücari means "exis tence" (world). Hence existent objects are the sphere of bhucari fakti. The various psyco-physical powers of the individual experient have, here, been described as expressions of various faktis. 

110. There are three aspects of amlakkarana, viz., buddhi, ahankāra and manas. Buddhi ascertains; ahdäkära brings about identification of the Self with the body etc., and assimilation of experience with oneself, and manas determines a thing as this or that. 

111. aifuarytfatti is the sovereign power of the Lord. This is also His Svatandrya-lakti, His absolute free Will. 

112 and 113. Flashing forth or sphuralla is here another name of prakala. Doership or kartta is another name of piwarda. Regarding the distinction between prakāta and vimarśt, see note 20. 

114. prana, apāna, santāna faktis. 

There are five pranas-prand, apana, samdina, udama, gydna. These are, however, mys or vital air. Prānas are the wym that carry out the functions of vegetative life. They are distinct from the body. Like vitalism, Indian philosophy maintains that life is some thing different from mere matter. Life is maintained by various pramas. Breath is the most palpable and concrete expression of prara. Präna is a compre hensive word covering all the functions of vegetative life. 

128 

PRATYABHIJNAHEDAYA It is, however, divided into various divisions according to various functions. Roughly, prapa is the vital payu that goes out, apana is the vital du that goes in downwards towards the anus. Samam is the vital we that is said to be located in the interior of the body. It helps in assimilation of food, etc. Hence it is known as samdha. Vydra means going in all directions. It is everywhere in the body. "Udāna" means "going upward'. The meaning of adana and wydna is, however, different in this system, inasmuchas they are, here, treated as faktis not as payu. 

115. Kalar means organs or phases, here those phases which bind the soul to the world. 

116. Butyaslata. This is a synonym of the fatma farira, the vehicle of the samiskdras which is not cast off at death like the sthala-larira or the physical body. "Puri' means 1 city and astakam means a group of eight-puryaştaka, meaning the city of the group of eight. This group of eight 

consists of the five danmatras, mamas, buddhi, and ahirkara. 

117. Uddina fatti. It is the fakti which appears when Prana and pana enter the sun and lose their separate identity. It is then known as udana which moves up through the madhya-dhdna or supumn and brings about the lirya or fourth state of consciousness. 

118. madhya-dhdma is the middle iddi or sup . There are two madis running in a parallel way on to the Suşumna. They are not physical but prágic, and are known as ida and pingala. Priņa flows through the ide and spara flows through the pingala. Susumnā is a pranic wadi running inside the spinal column. Normally the prāņo and apāna Sakti alone are active. When, however, through the practice of yoga, prema and apdnd currents are equilibrated the S M nadi becomes open, and the udana current flows through it and brings about the lurya state of consciousness. 

119. Turya literally means the fourth. Normally man's consciousness functions only in three states, viz., waking Gjägrat), dreaming (svápna), and dreamless sleep (suşupti). When udāns fatti becomes active in the madhya-chamd Or 

NOTES 

129 wumni, one develops the consciousness of trwa or the fourth state in which one has unity-consciousness and the sense of difference disappears. This consciousness is full of bliss. 

In the first or waking condition, the body, prama, marias and senses are active. In the second or dreaming condition, the prane and m ar alonc are active. In the third or the state of deep sleep, even the namas stops functioning, and man or pure consciousness is in association with merc void. In the furya or fourth state, dtman is detached from these limitations, and remains pure consciousness and bliss (cida mandaghana). It is integral awareness in which the sense of difference has disappeared. This state is brought about by udána-fakti. 

120. Vydna-sakti -Macrocosmically it pervades the entire universe and microcosmically it pervades the entire body when the kndaluri becomes awakened, and brings about the turyātita condition. 

121. furyalila means transcending the fourth state. It is a state beyond the tury. It is a state where pure conscious ness is like an ocean without any ruffle whatsoever, and is full of bliss. It is the consciousness of Siya himself or one who has reached that stage in which the entire universe appears as his self. 

122. pali-This refers to the condition in which the individual soul realizes his identity with the universal Self or pati or Siva. 

123. In the 9th sutra, the sawudritua has been described from cpistemological point of view; here in the 12th sutra), it has been described from the microcosmic point of view both in the individuals pasu dafd (bound state) and pati da (liberated state). 

124. It is not clear as to which Pratyabhijña-tika is referred to here. Perhaps it may be the untraced vivsti on the Pratyabhijna-karikās by Utpalācārya. 

125. Cirila means the limited individual consciousness, the psychological status of the individual. 

FILTETEN130 

PRATYA DHINAERDAYA 126. Citi means the universal consciousness, the absolute consciousness. 

127. Celana in this context means the consciousness of the Self. 

128. Utapaladevă or Utpalacārya flourished in about 900-950 A.D. This quotation is from his stolravali in praise of Siva. 

129. The traditional trinity consists of Brahma, Vişnu, and Siva. Since in this system, Siva is mostly the term used for the Absolute, Indra has been substituted for Siva in the trinity. 

130. This is a quotation from the Spanda-kārika of Vasu gupta. The full verse is as follows: 

तदाक्रम्प बलं मन्त्राः सर्वज्ञबलशालिनः । 

प्रवर्तन्तेऽधिकाराय करणानीय देहिनाम् ।। i.c., the mantras having resorted to that power of cili) alone become all-knowing and all-powerful and then proceed to achieve their objects, even as the senses of the individual (achieve their objects by the power of the individual, not by themselves). 

131. Samiveśa means samadhi in which there is unity experience i.e. in which the entire universe appears as Scif. 

132. dela-prana-trila-sukladdiga. 

deha-prdna are examples of the subject in which deha is relatively outer and prāna, inner; milosukhadisu are examples of 'object in which again wila is outer experience, and sukla is inner experience. 

133. Vyutthama means literally rising up", i.c., rising up from the condition of contemplation to every-day normal experience. 

134. Prana-Sakti here means the primal energy, not pränavāyu or the breath of that name. The transformation of consciousness into praga is a step towards its progressive materialization. This präpa is also known as mampraha. 

135. Madhya, from the point of view of Sambhu or Siva is his universal consciousness which is the innermost or central reality of all existence; it is the pure I-consciousness 

131 

NOTES of Siva. From the point of view of Sakti, it is jiāna-krip knowledge and action--the spiritual urge to know every thing and to do everything. From the point of view of ru or the individual, it is the suumad niidi which is in between ida and pingala midis or sandma, between präng iind apena. Here madhya-nddi refers to sumn. The radis and cakras referred to in yoga are not to be taken as physical constituents like the nerves and ganglia. They are parts of the prapamya-koşa the vital sheath in the sük ma-farira (the subtle body). Only their impact in the physical body is felt through the nerves and the ganglia. 

136. Brahma-randhra; adhowaktra. According to yoga, there are cakrar or centres of prāna located in the prana- 

ma kofa. These are called cakras, because they are like wheel in appearance. They absorb and distribute prāņa or vitality to the pränamaya-kosa, and through it to the physical body. Their names together with the nearest physical organs are given below:

137. dho-satira (lit., the lower organ) is the medhra-kanda ( R) which is situated below wuladhara at the root of the rectum. 

138. Palasa is the 'butea frondosa' or the Dhāka tree as it is otherwise called. Susumind is compared to the mid-rib of the palala leaf, and madis springing from it are compared to the fine veinlets joined to the midrib of the plaša. 

OSO DEG. 

PRATYADHI) NURDAYA 139. "When, however, the exalted samoil.....ruabove." This refers to the development from the Sambhavopāya and Saktopāya points of view. 

140. brahmanddi is the same as the madhya-nadi or supum . 

141. "When the central brakmaddi develops". This refers to the development from the anavopaya point of view. 

142. prāņāyāma means breath control. There are various methods of breath control in books on yoga. 

143. mudra-The word literally means 'scal', 'mark'. In yoga, it means certain positions of fingers practised in yogic discipline. In a wider sense, it also means control of certain organs that help in concentration; also concentration. Sec Gheranda--sanhita -Titiyopadeśaḥ (Lesson Third). 

144. handha-This is a yogic practice in which certain organs of the body are contracted or locked. 

145. See note 47. . 146. ry (lit, fourth) is the same as duriya. See note 79. It is the state in which there is pure consciousness of atman, and the sense of difference disappears. In this Udāna lakti is active. 

147. furydim - This is the state higher than fwya. Unity consciousness that began in furya is consummated in furydtita in which the whole universe appears as the Self. See Isvara pratyabhijn-vimarśinī, Vol. II, pp. 246-247. In luralita, Own fakti Gkti is active. 

148. 'Katha' upanisad really belongs to the black Yajur veda. The original reading is 'iochan' (wishing: seeking): the reading here adopted is afhan cating, tasting). In this context asnan means 'wishing to taste." 

149. There are two states of clear Self-consciousness, viz; Santodila, and wiryodita. In the first, there may be diminution of the clarity of self-consciousness some times, but in the second, Self-consciousness is complete and permanent. 

150. Ordkw-KandalimiThis is the condition where the präna and apana enter the suşumna and the kundalini rises up. Kundalini is a distinct fakti that lies folded up in three 

NOTİs 

133 

and half valeyas or folds in Mölādhāra. When she rises from one-three-fourths of the folds, goes up through fund, crosses Lambikā and pierces Brahmarandhra, she is known as Urdhva-Kundalini, and this pervasion of hers is known as vikisa or visa. Lambikā is the pranic cross-road of four prdnic channels, near the palate. The first two channels are for the flow of prara for all the jības. The third channel is that through which the vogin rises from miladhara by means of Ardhan-kwidalini to Brahrandhra, as described here. The fourth channel is for those accomplished yogins whose prana Väyu rises directly to Brahman-randhra without having to pass through müladhara. 

151. Adha-kudalusi. Its field is from Lambikā down - to one-three-fourths of the folds of kundalini lying folded in the ladhara. Prāna goes down in adhah-budolini from Lambiki towards maladhara. This is known as savitoca or vahni. 

152. Sastha- 

w ira. Prof. Leidecker translates wakira as mouth, and thinks that 'sixth month" is unintelligible. Vaktra in this context does not mean "mouth". It means here simply organ. The cars, eyes, nose, mouth, and the anus are, in this system, known as panca-vaktra or five organs and medhra-tanda near the root of the rectum, which is below mülādhāra is the pastha-vaktra, the sixth organ. 

153. Vahvi-visa : Vanui refers to adhah-kundalini and viņa to urdhva-kundalini. The entrance into the adhah kundalini is sankoca or vahni; rising into urdhva-kundalini is vikäsa or visa. Valuri is symbolic of prāņa vāyu and viņa of apāna vāyu. When präna enters the suşumni and goes down into adhah-kundalini or mūlādhara, then this condition is known as bahi. Entering into the full portion of the root and half of tlie middle of adhas-kundalini is known as Bahri or sarkoca. Vatni is derived from the root 'vah'-to carry. Since präna is carried down upto mulãdhāra in this state, it is called valni. The defa or entering into the remaining half of the madhya or middle and full portion of the agra or tip of the adhab-kundalin right upto the lowest spot of Graha Kundalini is known as pipa. 

D'RATYADHIJRAHEDAYA 154. The word "viga" does not mean poison here. It is derived from the root vis' to pervade. Visa, therefore, refers to prasara or vikäsa. Poison is also called 'visa'. because it pervades the whole body. 

What is meant to be conveyed is that when the präna and apăna enter the susumna, the citta or individual consciousness should be stopped or suspended between the valur and sisa or in other words between the adha-kundalini and the fordhwa-kundalini. 

Vayup ürna-full of uw means that the citla should be restrained in such a way that wayu may neither pass out through the nostrils nor through the male organ and the anus. Cinta and we are inter-connected. Restraint of one brings about the restraint of the other. 

When the citl can be restrained between the adha and the erdha kundalini in this way, then one has the joy of sexual union. This is 'inverted" kima. Sexual union is external; this union is internal...", 

155. This refers to the yogic practice of the school. Perfection is accomplished by the development of "madhya" which in the case of or the individual jina means the development of prāna-sakti in the supund which is in the wadhya or between the ido and pingala dadis. One way of the development of madhya is the saikoca and pildsa of the fakti. The literal translation of sarikoca and vitara can hardly do justice to the yogic practice indicated by thesc. Sankoca connotes the following discipline. Even while mind is going forth towards external objects by means of the senses, even while the senses are actively functioning in grasping form, colour, sound, smell, etc., attention is withdrawn from them and 

med towards the inner reality which is the source and back ground of all activity. 

Vitara means concentration on the inner reality even while the sense-organs are quite open, c.g., the practice of the Wairaal mudrd. 

Sailoca implies withdrawal of attention from external objects; 

NOTES 

135 vitása implies concentration of attention on the inner consciousness and not allowing it to go out at all even when the cyes, ears. etc., are open to their respective objects. It means remain ing steady within like a gold pillar, even while the senses are directed towards their objects. 

Sarkoon and Vikisa have to be further developed by the technique of prarara-uifranti at the level of ardhwa-kundalini. Prasara is, here, practically synonymous with pikära and vifranti with sankoca. The yogin develops the prana-fatti in the SULFILM, and by restraining it between the eye-brows, he attains to Urdha-kundalini level. Here he practises prasaravifdnti. 

This practice of sankoca and vildsa has to be developed in adhah-kundalini also. Entering completely into the root and half of the middle of adha-kwidalini is known as Sarioca or pahni, and entering into the remaining half and wholly into the tip of the adha-kundalini right up to the position where the Urdhwa-kundalini ends is known as pikasa or via or wulana samadhi. 

156. Amacka : aca= a, i, u, , 1, 4, 0, ai, au, i. c, all the the vowels; "anacka' is sounding ka, ha, etc. without the vowel. The real meaning of the yogic practice of anacka sound ing is to concentrate on any mantra back to the source where it is unuttered. 

157. Leidecker has given a very confused translation of this verse. The following points have to be noted in this verse. This is in praise of jagadamba—the world-mother; "tava" (your) refers to 'jagadamba'. "Anackała...ctido'; 'vidhrta-cetasal', and "ddritandhalamarah' are compounds qualifying "hfdaya pankajasya'. 'Vidyankuro' is connected with 'tava'. Or däritandha-tamasah may be taken as qualifying "tava". 

158. "dvādaśantah'= measure of twelve fingers; literally, it means the end of twelve fingers. 

159. The prāža starts at the point of Ardaya (präpollăsa) and ends (vibrānti) at doadaslarla, i.e., at a distance of twelve fingers from it. "Nibhälana' means fixing the citta or mind at the start of präna at the heart, and at its cessation at a dis tance of twelve fingers from the heart. 

136 

PRATYADHIJNAHRDAYA 160. "Beautiful one' refers to the dai (the goddess). 

161. m esa (lit., unfolding) is a technical term of this yoga. Only half of the verse has been quoted in the text. The full verse is as given below = 

"Eka-cinta-prasaktasya yatah syātaparodayah. Unmesah sa tu vijeyah svayama tam-upalakşayet". This means while one is engagesd in one thought and another arises, then resting mentally at the junction point between the two is known as red. One can see that for oneself". The nature of mind is to pass successively from thought to thought, but if one rests mentally immediately after one thought and just before another thought arises, one develops the quality of urned. It means resting in the spanda between two thoughts or images, i.c., resting in the consciousness which is the background of both the thoughts or images. This is the explanation according to Satomya. 

According to Sambhapopaya, the emergence of the dra marthi bhd or the highest reality, while one is engaged in meditating on the object of one's devotion is known as mesa. 

162. Three methods have been recommended here for rising to the highest bliss by concentrating on aesthetic enjoy ment, viz., (1) rasadhāraņā-concentrating on the savour of eating and drinking, (2) Sabda-dMrapi concentrating on the aesthetic enjoyment of music, and (3) Wado-sadirkalpa-dharana concentrating on whatever pleases the mind. 

163. For the meaning of samáveša, sec p. 205 of the first ähnika of the first volume of Tantrāloka by Abhinavagupta : 

आवेशपचास्वतंत्रस्प, स्वतद्पनिमज्जनात् । परतद्रूपता शम्भो 

skyffira: 11 (V. 172) Aveša or Samávesa means mergence of the helpless, limited self into and becoming identical with supreme Siva who is at one with the original Sakti. Samāvesa means shedd ing one's limited nature, getting absorbed into the Supreme, and acquiring its mure.

.. . NOTES 164. Nimicama-samadhi is the inward meditation with closed cyes in which the individual consciousness is absorbed in the universal consciousness. In this even the trace of object as object disappears and it becomes one with chit. This is real introversion or antarmukhara, and leads to full I-conscious nes or piphantă. 

165. Krama-mudra or Mudra-Krama. This is defined in the text itself by the Krama-sutra. In this, the mind swings alternately between the internal and the extemal. The internal appears as the universal consciousness, and the exter nal no longer appears as merely the world, but as the form of Siva or universal consciousness. Mudrā, here is not used in its ordinary sense of certain postures and positions of finger, etc. The sense in which it is used here is given further on in the text itself. 

166. samoil-dcoold-cakran-From the macrocosmic point of view, the capil-dealas are the Khecari-cakrami, gocari cakran, dit-cari-cakran, and bhacari-cakram described earlier. From the microcosmic point of view this consists of the internal and external senses. 

167. Kalugnpūdes carama-kala-parpantasya-from kālāgni, the lowest phase of manifestation upto the highest phase of manifestation known as fantā-kala. Kala here means phase of manifestation. See the annexed chart of manifestation. 

168. para-bhadlarika here refers to the highest vimarfa. There are three kinds of vimarśa, viz., para, apara and parapara. 

Para is the pimarja of Siva in which there is abheda or complete non-difference; apara is the vinarla of any or the empirical individual in which there is bluda or difference; paräpara is the bimarfa of fokti in whch there is bhedabheda in which the sense of difference is transcended ultimately. 

169. Camatkāra is the wonderful joy of creativity. Here it means alam-vinarsa—the bliss of perfect Self-consciousness i.c. the bliss of the consciousness of the crilire manifestation as I. This alan-wimarda is the result of the feeling of one-ness of being with136 

PRATYADHIJNAHRDAYA prakāda consciousness-existence). Regarding prakda and vimarfa, Sce note 19. The ultimate-is prakafa-uimar&a-maya. It is both the universe in its manifested and unmanifested state, and also its permanent substratum. 

170. Krenardja gives here the ascending stages of reality. The first is saudastam-cognition. The second is the expe rient who has self-consciousness. The third and deeper stage of reality is that of Sadasiva whose consciousness is not identified with the limiting adjuncts of body etc., but whose body is the whole universe. The highest stage of reality is Siva whose consciousness of Self is inclusive of entire manifestation and identical with his pratada. 

171. gadananda is a technical word of this system and means the bliss of the Self appearing as the universe. The universe in this system is not a fall from the bliss of the Divine; it is rather the bliss of the Divine made visible. Cf. the follow ing verse of Abhinavagupta : 

(Verse 50 and 51 of 5th ähnika of Tanträloka Vol. III.) 

पत्र कोऽपि व्यवच्छेदो नास्ति यदिश्वतः स्फुरत् पदनाहतसंवित्ति परमामृत हितम् ।। यत्रास्ति भावनादीनां न मुख्या कापि संगतिः । 

सदेव जगदानन्दमस्मन्यं वांमुरूचिवान् ।। That in which there is no division or limitation, for it flashes forth all round, in which the consciousness iš intact, i.e. in which it is consciousness alone which expresses itself whether as knower or means of knowledge or as known, that which increases and expands by the nectar of divine joy, in which there is no need for imagination or meditation. Sambhu told me that that was jagadananda. The com mentator says: 

"जगता निजानन्दाद्यात्मना विश्वेन रूपेणानन्दो यत्र यतश्चेति जगदा नन्दशब्दवाच्यम्" 

That is jugadananda where the universe appears as a visible form of the bliss of the Self. Sambhu referred to in the above verse was the chief guru of Abhinavagupta in Triki systein. 

NOTES 

139 

172. According to Tantra there is a correspondence between the para-fakti, the ultimate divine creative power which brings about the sum total of all objects and the paravāk which is the ultimate divine word bringing about the sum 

total of words. By means of mantras which consist of words or letters, one can establish contact with the various faktis. Every word is a bicada or indicator and every object is veya or the indicated. The wapya or object is nothing but the intent of the divine word, the divine word made visible. 

The divine words or letters are, however, a-mīly out of the scope of maya. Words are of two kinds, viz. dylja (pertaining to muiya) and a-widyba (not pertaining to māyā). Máyiya words are those on which the meaning is imposed by convention; a-mdyba words are those which are wirvikalpaka, whose meaning is just the real, which do not depend on fancy, imposition, supposition or convention, which are Cinmayd. 

173. itula: "Eulan faktir-iti proktam, akılan Siva ugyate" (Svacchanda tantra) i. c. kula is sakti and akula is Siva. Kula (total) or the entire manifestation is fakti. One who is not lost in this total (manifestation) is akula i.e. Siva. The letter from the point of view of m yka-cakra is of the nature of Siva. 

174. pratyahara here does not mean "withdrawing the citta from the elements", As Prof. Leidecker makes out in his note, 227. The word 'pralaura' has been wed here in the technical sense of Samskrta Grammar which means the "comprehension of several letters or affixes into one syllable, effected by combining the first letter of a sutra with its final indicatory letter'. Thus the pratyāhāra, "aca' means à, i, u, le, o, for it combines the first letter 'a' and the final indicatory letter "d' of the following sutras-KUU, 26, एओह ऐसोच 

So here the pratyahara of 'a' the first letter, and tha' the final letter would be "aha', which suggests "aham', meaning 'I' or Sell. "Aha' includes all the letters of the samsksta language, and since cach letter is indicative of an object, 

140 

PRATYADHIJNAHRDAYA 'aha' suggests the surn-total of all objects, viz., the universe. The entire universe lies in the highest Reality or Siva in an undifferentiated state. 

175. bindu : This means a drop, a point, a dot. In the definite calm of the Highest Reality (anuttara), there arises a metaphysical Point of stress. This is known as bindy. In this, the universe to be lies gathered up into a point. This bindu is known as ghanibhala fakti -- the creative forces compact ed into a Point. It is as yet undifferentiated into objects. It is the cidghana or massive consciousness in which lie potentially in an undifferentiated mass all the worlds and beings to be manifested. Therefore, the text says that all and 'ha", joined into "aha', and thus together summing up the entire manifestation lie undi(Terentiated into a point in the Highest Reality. A point is indicative of non-diferentiation. From the point of view of language, the 'bindu' in Samsksta is indicated by annspära--the nasal sound marked by a dot on a letter. Bindu is thus the churwra, and this completes "aha" into "aham (H). This armoira, after having joined, 'a' and 'ha' in oneness shows that all manifestation though appearing emanated and different is actually residing in Siva, and is not different form Him. 'A' represents Siva; 'ha' represents Sakti; the anusvāra represents the fact that though Siva is manifested right upto the earth through Sakti, he is not divided thereby; he remains undivided (avi bhäga-vedanätmaka-bindu-rüpatayā). 

176. maharada'--the great or deep lake refers to the Supreme Spiritual awareness. It has been called a great or deep lake, because it is clear, uncovered by anything, infinite and deep. 

177. Catrauarit has a double sense here (1) ruler of the cakra i.ecircle or group of sense-deities and (2) universal Sovereign. 

178. When the senses are divinised, they become scivit deadla-cakra i.e., karadari.

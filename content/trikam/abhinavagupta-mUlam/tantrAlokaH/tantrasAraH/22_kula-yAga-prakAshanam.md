Therefore, in texts such as the Yoga-saṁcāra, etc., it has been stated:

Bliss is Brahman which abides in the body.  
That bliss is established in a threefold way in the last syllable under pa-varga - that is the labials.  
The person who is not a brahmacārin and abstains from the procedure of following the three ma-kāras (that is the ritual involving the three forbidden elements) is bereft of bliss.  
Bliss being bereft of wine, etc., and those who, forsaking it, engage themselves in worshipping in the cakra in both ways are cooked in a dreadful hell.  
Therefore, one should follow the prescribed procedure.

The Kula form of ritual is to be performed in the following way.  
The ritual is sixfold: external, in the śakti, in one's own body, in the union of the two, in the vital air, and in consciousness.

Among the six, each latter is more excellent than the former, but the performance of each former one is based on one's sweet will.  
One who is desirous of attaining enjoyment should select the second, fourth, and fifth;  
but the sixth is the principal ritual for the one who is desirous of liberation.  
Even this kind of person should perform the rituals beginning from the second, as far as is possible, during the occasional observances, for in that way the precept is fulfilled.

In this ritual, without taking recourse to the ritual bath, etc., one attains purity by simply taking repose in the perfect blissful state.   
Then, while meditating on the oneness of the vital energy, consciousness, and the body,  
and (with the awareness that this) consciousness is identical with great Lord,  
one should repeat the mantra twenty-seven times.  
Then, one should place the mantra (nyāsa) on the top of the head, the face, the heart, the secret part, and the mūrtis, first in the natural order, and then in reverse.  
In this way the fullness of identity with the great Lord in his āparā, parāparā, and parā forms is attained.

The number of principles (tattvas) from māyā, puruṣa, guṇa, buddhi, to earth principle is twenty-seven.  The principles kalā, etc., are included in it.  
The vidyāśaktis possess the nature of the higher-cum-lower aspects. The five Brahmas (Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Rudra, īśvara, and Sadāśiva), Sadyājāta, Bhavodbhavatva, and the others have twenty-seven aspects. This has been explained by the venerable, glorious Lakulesa as well as others.

206 TANTRASĀRA 





The great Lord (Parameśvara) possesses five śaktis, even in its highest aspect, and each of these śaktis possesses five aspects. Thus, the number of śaktis is twenty-five. When these śaktis are not shining distinctly as differentiated from each other, they are then said to be one; that is, a non-differentiated point (anud bhinnavibhāgā). With the pervasiveness of the twenty-seven, she should be meditated on as the flame of consciousness. It repre

: 

sents the intellect and the vital energy, and it should be tied into the sacred hair on the head (śikhā) while uttering the mantra once. It should be thought of as being bound so securely with great Lord that nothing extraneous can approach it. Then, all the articles for the ritual, the place of worship, and the guardian deities of the quarters, which are in front of him, should all be conceived as being of his essence because they have been permeated by the whole group of instruments of knowledge dominated by that sort of intellect [related to the supreme Lord]. 

Then, the vessel for the offering should be filled with the per vasive thought of tying of the sacred hair on the head and should be worshipped. The altars also are to be worshipped by a few drops of the liquid uniting the tip of the thumb and the fourth fin ger. One should worship the host of mantras located in the cakras of the body, and should offer oblations to them. The worshipper should perform this ritual in the vital energy. 

Then, on the altar one should draw a seat with the character of the trident ending in three śaktis representing Parā, Parāparā, and Aparā. All the principles from earth to the end of māyā are included in the syllable "sa," and the syllable "au" is to be con ceived as the seat of three śaktis. In the syllable "sa," all the prin ciples ending in māyā, and in "au," the threefold śaktis are to be worshipped and [over there] the śakti with the characteristic of reflective consciousness (vimarśarūpa śakti) should be wor shipped. Thus, uttering the mantra (sauḥ) once, the placement of it as the base (adhāra) and the one to be placed over it (adheya) should be done. Then, in the consciousness, which is indeed adheya, one should conceive this universe in it, which is also com posed of consciousness. Thus, this universe is enclosed by means of consciousness, and by this universe consciousness comes into being, because this universe has appeared from consciousness and terminates in it. From the knowable objects, consciousness arises and gets its rest therein. The reality of the nature of conscious ness is arrived at only by means of mutual activity of enclosure (coitus). Therefore, it has been stated "enclosing all the syllables." 

208 TANTRASĀRA 

Then, one should offer sandal paste, incense, wine, flowers, and so on, as long as one does not become completely absorbed in the supreme. Then gaining repose in one's own Self, one should then throw everything into the water. 

This is the procedure of the external form of ritual.

The Procedure in the śakti (Ritual) The pair is mutually eager to have the nature of the other. śakti likes to have the nature of the vīra, and vīra that of Śakti. As both are of the nature of both, it is shining at the beginning and end ing in sr̥ṣṭi (coitus), essential for awakening the nature of śiva and śakti in both, which is the function of both. By means of the restraining power of the Lord, the predominant nature is normally present in both. This explains the specific center, that is, the secret parts, which are also designated to be conceived as Śakti. Then, it is worshipped by means of the pervasive thought of sikhābandha; that is, the tying of the tuft of the hair on the head. Visarga śakti is to be conceived in the seat ending with three śaktis, in three corners, and in the center. This is the specific feature of the concept of pervasion. The same procedure is to be done on the specific limb of one's body, in that very cakra; then it is done in the brahmarandhra and in other minor centers.

The Procedure Regarding the Pair (Yāmala) The characteristic feature of the śakti is sin its being] that by which perfect steadiness of nonduality is attained. Therefore, without considering age, caste, worldly and otherworldly spiritual relations, one attains supreme identity of nonduality born of both [male and female] (1). 

The śaktis are of three types: the created, the caused, and the born of the union of both. They are conceived otherwise by subsidiary divisions. They are mutually worshipped and propitiated because bliss is adjacent there (2). "The (principal] cakra should be properly worshipped. Other minor cakras should be worshipped after that. The external worship is to be performed by the offering of flowers, sandal paste, etc., and inwardly they are to be propitiated by means of offering food, wine, etc. (3). 

Thus, the upsurge of the mass of bliss becomes manifest by means of various activities and, as a result, all the minor cakras, being dissolved in the principal cakra, become identified with it (4). 

All of the minor cakras attain the fullness of enjoyment by means of enjoying their respective spheres [of enjoyment], and as a result they relish their own nature. Thus, all the deities of minor cakras become centrally inclined to the principal cakra of con sciousness (5). 

When the fullness of the rays, characterized by the host of the deities of the minor cakras, bring about vigor to both the śakti and the possessor of śakti, they both become exceedingly inclined toward each other (6). 

[At the time of union] of the pair, while they enter the highest abode of bliss, the agitation born of its vibration agitates the minor cakras as well, and they should be conceived as identical with it because they are not distinct from it (7). 

TANTRASĀRA 211 

Thus when, by means of the comparative development of balance, this pair loses all distinctions, which is difficult to express in words, then that consciousness is known as the compact unity of the emission of both (8). That steady abode of anuttara, the beyond, is characteristic of both; that is, transcendent and immanent, which is otherwise designated as the lofty, all-inclusive universal bliss. This is neither the state of tranquility, or ever-restfulness, nor the state of rising, but is called the highest Kaula, the cause of the rest and the act of rising. 

The one who is desirous of the attainment of the non-limited 

· nature of the Self should make himself identical with conscious ness. It is true that both, with the characteristics of resting and rising regarding the śakti and the possessor of śakti, rise simulta neously (9-10). On account of the mutual absorption of both, the very nature of the Self, both are of the characteristics of resting and rising, because both have the characteristics of both. However, it is the śakti who bears the rising of creation in her womb, but not the one who is the possessor of the śakti (11). 

In this śakti, the Kula, which is embodied in the teacher, should be transmitted into the śakti, and through her, because of the close union which emanates by the mutual contact of both [should be collected] and distributed among the people (11a). 

Therefore, in this twofold creation of rest and rising, those who concentrate on the former, the state of visarga and that it is the cause of both (that is, those who reflect that everything is the expansion of visarga), they become steadily rested in the perfect state free from all limitations (11b-12a). 

That which rises from the mutual union of both should be col lected externally from the principal mouth. Worship with it will satisfy the host of deities, and it will be the bestower of attain ments and liberation (125-13a). 

212 TANTRASĀRA 

By the practice of visarga with the nature of rest, the restful [state of] śivahood is attained, and also the host of deities shines with the same nature. At that very state, the rising of the absolute void occurs, which is devoid of bliss (nirānandamaya). It is free from modality, not only of the abode, but also of others (13b-14a). By the delightful tasting of the external object, by which one's own blissful nature is filled, and not only by this, but also by the inner organs which are taking delight from tasting the delightful object, the nature of one's own and, by this process (of the tasting delight and experience of fullness one's own self], the perfect state of the inner search of this experience adds to the delightful nature of the minor cakras and, from there, to the main ones (155-16a). This threefold visarga conforms to its meaning. It is full in every respect, from where everything is created, from where this mani fold remains present, and where creation is dissolved. In this description of visarga above, which is threefold, mantravīrya being continuously reflected upon in its threefold form, the true potency of mantra is then attained. Thus, in mantravīrya, which is the inner core of consciousness, the mantra [abiding there) gives birth to various results (16b-17). In the middle of the triangle, there exists an ever-blooming lotus veiling the mandala. In its center is a stalk having a lotus with six teen petals, with a root inseparably attached to it. In the course of the friction of the two lotuses having a stalk attached to each, the host of kalās lying within the moon, perfectly full and charming, and those lying within the sun, and by the association with blood and semen related to the three-petalled lotus, the creation of the sprout representing fire occurs (18-20a). 

Thus, taking recourse to the mudrā representing the moon, the sun, and fire (known as samgatta mudrā), one who has inter nalized the sequence of creation, etc., in his heart, regarding the sequence of creation, etc., quickly attains the fourth state (anākhyā) (20b-21a). 

TANTRASĀRA 213 

In consequence of the absorption in the khecari mudrā of both the Śakti and the possessor of śakti, or, in other words, when perfect equilibrium of both occurs, whatever experience comes about in the enjoyment of drink, sport, and fun merges in vimarśa follow ing the course of unmanifest (avyakta), dhvani, rava, sphoṭa, śruti, nāda, nādānta; remains as anāhata without any break; and finally becomes the virile energy of the mantra (mantravīrya) (216-23a). [The cakras are eight:) the outgoing and ingoing of the vital air at the time of their cessation; in the ear while hearing a sound; in the eye while perceiving an object; the coming in contact of both the 'sexual organs; during their union; at the end of twelve; and in the yāmala (236–24a). From the middle of the breast to the end of the lips the unmanifest sound exists, abiding in the throat; one who listens to it inside both the cakras at the time of the cessation of agitation where all have their rest, that is, nādabhairava, the Absolute having eight fold forms, that is, ardhacandra, nāda, śakti representing jyoti, dhvani, samaratthis is stated to be the absolute extension of the mantra (24b-26). Thus, calling up the above extension in the mind in every act, and in whatever it may be, one remains nonattached while living and becomes absolute Bhairava (27). The place where the void and the nonvoid dissolve is the middle path in the form of a shaft where the fire and air have dissolved in the equilibrium of the trident. This is to be meditated upon in such a way as fluid that has gone to rest in the fluid (28). Remaining steady in firm conviction without allowing any doubt to rise, one should continue contemplating, “I am not," and should get oneself free from the bondage of ācāra, witnessing the host of divinities in the body, merging pleasure and worries in the mass of consciousness, and all the time viewing the recipient of them which abides in the centers of the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose and other centers. In this way khecari is certainly attained (29-30).

When getting one's body placed in a distant sky and instanta neously following the sahasamudrā, contracting both the hands gets it to fall, while one remains looking below. This mudrā turns into vyomacari (31). Here ends the description of the ritual named yāmala. ____ उक्तव्याप्तिके प्राणे विश्वमये प्रोक्तसंविद्याप्त्या तर्पणानगन्धधूपादिसमर्पणेन उपोद्वलनं प्राणयागः । विश्रान्तिरूढिस्तु संविद्यागः प्रागेव निरूपितः। एवम् एतेभ्यो यागेभ्योऽन्यतमं कृत्वा यदि तथाविधनिर्विचिकित्सतापवित्रितत्हृदयः शिष्यो भवति तदा तस्मै तद्यागदर्शनपूर्वकं तिलाज्याहुतिपूर्वकनिरपेक्षमेव पूर्वोक्तव्याप्त्या

Thus, in the vital air with the characteristic of such an exten sion of immanence, one should associate it with consciousness, and then with the association of saṁvid, the offering of tarpana, food, sandal paste, incense, etc., one should be made steady. This is the ritual regarding the vital air. The ritual in the form of samvid has been discussed earlier in regard to one who has attained steadiness in it. After performing one of the rituals among them, if the disciple becomes free from doubts and attains purity of the heart, then showing him the ritual without taking recourse to offering sesame and clarified butter into the fire, and so on, he should be given initiation only by mere glance while keeping in his heart the aforesaid permeating extension (vyāpti). 

From the initiation given in absence to the end of the occasional ritual, the above procedures are to be followed, but they are to be performed keeping this as the principal ritual. The seven forms of kulayāga are performed in the body of the spiritual teacher, but when this is performed once along with the aforesaid ritual, every thing becomes perfect. Thus may the end be auspicious. This is a work of revered Abhinavaguptapāda ācārya.

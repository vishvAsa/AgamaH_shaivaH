Chapter Fourteen Now, the procedure of putraka[^202] and other types of initiations will be elaborated. This is an elaborate procedure, and it should be properly understood by studying the Tantrāloka; however, it will also be explained here. 

After completion of the procedure for attaining the status of samayin, one should perform rituals on the third day for all the deities in the sacred diagram (maṇdala), consisting of the tri dent and the lotus. There, the external family (parivāra)[^203] of the deities and the group of deities of the doors[^204] should be wor shipped outside. Then, to the east of the sacred diagram, begin ning from the northeast to the southeastern part of the mandala, one should worship Gaṇeśa, the teacher, the teacher's teacher, the great-grand-teacher, the perfected teachers of the past, the host of yoginis, the Goddess of Speech (Vāgīśvarī), and the guardian of the field, in linear order.[^205] After receiving the proper permission from them, he should place the entire sixfold path there, beginning from the root of the trident to the end of white lotus, and should then worship them. 

After this, in the middle trident, on the middle prong, he should worship the venerable goddess Śrīparābhattārikā together with Lord Bhairava. On the left prong venerable Srīmadāparā, and on the right prong venerable Srīparāparā, together with Bhai rava, should be worshipped. On the right trident, occupying the middle prong is goddess Śrīparāparā, and on the left trident the goddess Srīmadāparā occupies the middle prong, and the other deities are to be placed accordingly. Thus, as the supreme God dess is predominant over all, everything attains fullness because of that superiority. Then, in the middle prong of the middle tri 

TANTRASĀRA 169 

dent, the entire group of deities, ending with their weapons (astra), the guardians of the quarters, should be worshipped, conceiving them as being identical with the supreme Goddess. It is because of her superiority over all that it is conceived that everything has been worshipped. After this, in the small jar, in the big jar, in the sacred diagram, in the fire, and in one's own self, these five substratums are to be unified with nonduality. Then he should perform the specific worship with flowers, etc., which were nour ished by the nectarine fluid of the supreme Lord's essence of non duality. Furthermore, one should fill the ritual ground with liba tions of water and materials for offering, free from any deceit regarding the spending of money. If the person lacks money, then the ritual called mahamandalayāga should not be performed. He should offer living animals. In this way, the animals also become recipients of grace. By doing this, one is showing compassion to the animal and should not have any doubt regarding the efficiency of animal sacrifices.

Then, propitiating Parameśvara with offering of sesame seeds mixed with clarified butter, he should place the animal before the fire for the offering of marrow into it.206 After this, he should propitiate the host of deities with that marrow. Then, addressing the Lord and conceiving one's own Self as not different from all, and being perfectly full of the six paths, the teacher should bring the disciple in front of him. But in this initiation, which is per formed indirectly in the absence of a disciple who is going to die, the teacher should conceive the disciple as being present in front

of him, or place a substitute made of kusa grass or cow dung. The teacher, after sprinkling him with drops of water from the ves sel and worshipping him with flowers, etc., should place all six paths into his body. The teacher should contemplate in this way: The merit of one desirous of enjoyment should not be purified; however, for one desirous of liberation, both merit and demerit should be purified. For one who is to receive the nirbīja form of initiation,207 the bonds of conventional duties should also be puri fied. This form of initiation is given to one who is about to die, or who is extremely dull. This is the command of the great Lord Parameśvara. Such a person also attains perfection by his devotion to the teacher, god, or fire... 

Here the distinction in attainment lies in the nature of one's latent impressions (vāsanā), for mantras grant different results according to one's latent desires. Therefore, ascertaining the nature of the latent desires of the disciple, the teacher cognizes the principal mantra internally and meditates on his identity with nondual śiva, and by doing so he purifies all the paths abiding in the disciple's body. In this way, his body, from the small toe to the end of twelve' (dvādaśānta), and his consciousness should be made one with the body and the consciousness of the disciple. Having accomplished this, he should rest in the immense lake of bliss, the essence of which is autonomy and Lordship, perfectly full, with the will, knowledge, and activity of the Lord of the host of deities, full of all paths, the entirety of the sphere of entities terminating in consciousness. By means of this kind of initiation with the self of the disciple, the disciple becomes identical with the supreme Lord. 

Then if the disciple is desirous of enjoyment, he should be united with the desired principle, either collectively or individu ally. After this, the teacher should conceive that the disciple has offered his body, composed of the pure principle, and that he has emerged immediately from the nature of the Lord for the purpose of an experience of the result still remaining to be enjoyed. The nature of this initiation is such as to disentangle all sorts of bonds

Then, the student should worship the teacher by offering payment, etc. to him. 

After this, rituals in the sacred fire with reference to the disci ple should be performed. Uttering the sriparāmantra, the teacher should say: "I am purifying this or that principle related to that particular person.” This utterance ends with 'svāhā.' Thus, three oblations are to be performed. These oblations, as well as the final one, are to be done with the mantravausat at the end. In this way all the principles ending with śiva are purified. Then, following the procedure of unification, the final oblation should be offered. After this, in regard to a person desirous of enjoyment, one obla tion for establishing the disciple in the place of enjoyment, and the other for creating the pure principle should be offered. After com pletion of this, the teacher should be worshipped by the disciple, and by the offering of payment, etc., to him. This is.the nature of the putraka form of initiation, by means of which all the past and the future deeds barring the present one, are purified. 

The well-enlightened teacher, after conceiving his own existence composed of all the paths and combining it with the interior and exterior, without any distinctions, should make the intellect, the vital energy, and the body of the disciple one with him. 

When the disciple, after attaining all at once the state of great bliss and consciousness, gets his rest there, then the paśu attains the nature of śiva.

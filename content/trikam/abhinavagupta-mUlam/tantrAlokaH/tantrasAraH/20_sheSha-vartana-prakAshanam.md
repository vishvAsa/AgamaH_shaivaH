Chapter Twenty Here, another chapter is introduced with the purpose of showing the lifelong course to be followed after initiation (seṣavartana). 

That initiation, which is given to those worthy of knowledge for the purpose of steady attainment of purification, is also given to those unworthy of knowledge, but to them it is given for the purpose of attainment of liberation. This type of initiation is the sabīja type.228 Thus, having given initiation, the teacher should instruct the disciple about the duty to be performed during the remaining period of his life. ___The duty for the rest of [the initiate's] life is threefold: indis pensable observances (nitya), occasional observances (naimittika), and those performed with a particular desire (kāmya). The last one is only observed by those desiring enjoyments (sādhaka) and therefore will not be described here. The nitya is the one which occurs regularly; the naimittika is the one by which one is able to attain oneness with the Lord. The auxiliaries to it are the prayers during the junctures (sandhyā) of the day, which are to be per formed on a daily basis, on the day of the festivals (parvadinam), and on the day of the offering of kusa grass (pavitrakam), etc. 

TANTRASĀRA 187 

They should also be considered daily observances, for they are reg ulated by the time of their occurrences. This is the view of some. 

However, there are occasional (naimittika) observances that are not regular in regard to the followers of the lineage of the teacher, as, for example, the time of the arrival of the spiritual teacher and his relatives, the day of a festival related to him (tatparvadinam), the day on which he received knowledge, etc. This is also the view of some. In these instances regular worship, the prayers at the junctures of the day, worship of the spiritual teacher, worship during the day of a festival, and worship of the pavitrakam also need to be performed without fail, 

The occasional observances (naimittikas) are the days on which the disciple obtained knowledge, the day when he received the holy text (sāstra), the arrival of the teacher and his relatives in his house, his birthday, the day of his initiation and the day of his departure from this world, secular festivals, the exposition of the scripture (i.e., the commencement of it, the intermediate (phasel, and the completion of it), the day on which he perceived the desired deity, the day of union with the spiritual partner (melaka), a command received in a dream, and release from the observance of convention (samaya). All these are the conditions for performing special kinds of worship as occasional rites. 

Then the disciple who has been initiated previously should be given the principal mantra, which possesses a potency of its own, which is in essence the pulsating consciousness of the mouth but without being written down.229 Then the said disciple, for the pur pose of being identified with God, should practice to attain one ness with God during the junctures of the day. Then, by means of that, for the attainment of such a sort of impression, one should worship the great Lord every day on the altar or in the linga. Regarding it, in a beautiful altar, one should contemplate one's own form as reflected in a mirror and it should be considered that one's own Self has become identical with the host of deities to be worshipped there. He should perceive it to be the reflected image 

188 TANTRASĀRA 

of the deity himself. Realizing thus, he should worship it with an offering of beautiful flowers, sandal paste, wine, propitiatory offerings of water, burning incense, lighting a lamp, presenting various materials, praising with songs, a recital of musical instru ments, and then should recite hymns in order to obtain undeviat ing identity with the desired deity. Just as [when one is] looking continuously at one's own face in the mirror, determination of its real nature occurs without any delay. Regarding this, no particular order is needed except attainment of one's identity with the man tra. The one who has attained absorption into the highest mantra and from whose nature the taints of the impressions of bonded beings have ceased as the result of the penetration of the flow of devotion, for him the net of all the bonds has dissolved and what ever remains in the heart is the highest, agreeable to all. This is the view of our teachers. 

The power of sight, composed of the highest nectar arising sportingly, basing itself on the light, extending as the supreme truth of entities, the knowers of the secret worship you with it. 

Making the earth as the base of all, and sprinkling it with the fluid of delight, and collecting flowers made of one's own mood emerged from the mind, having defused perfume, and placing it on the vessel of the priceless heart of my own-full to the brim with the nectar of bliss-I worship You, along with the divine Goddess, day and night in the divine temple of my body.

Thus contemplating the import of the two verses above in the core of one's heart, one should meditate on the host of deities. Then, showing mudras, repeating the mantra, and lastly, offer ing it, follows one after the other. The withdrawal (visarjanam) is its identity with consciousness. The main food offering should be eaten by oneself or should be thrown into the water. The creatures born in water had formerly been given initiation by means of eat ing caru (sacred boiled rice). If the caru is eaten by a cat, a mouse, or a dog, then, doubt having arisen, it becomes the cause of hell. : The knower of the truth, with a desire of showing grace to the world, should not behave contrary to the social order or remain secluded from it. Thus, here ends the worship of the altar. 

Next is the instruction regarding the linga.230 The linga should not be installed with the application of sacred mantras. This is particularly true for the vyakta form of linga. One should wor ship lingas (that are] firmly established, following the order of invocation and withdrawal, because this is the basis of all worship. In this regard, one should worship the body of the teacher, one's own body, the body of the śakti, the text in which sacred mantras exist, the vessel used by the heroes (vīrapātra), a rosary, a weapon (prāharaṇa), a linga collected from Narmadā river (bānalinga), a linga made of pearl, made of gold, made of flowers, made of charming materials like sandal paste, etc., or a mirror as the linga. 

It is by the force of the substratum (mūlādhara) that the excel lence of the attainment of perfection in mantras occurs. Hence, prior and posterior to it is the main, as the mantras act in concert with the quality of the substratum. Therefore, in accordance with the difference of aim to be attained, that very end is considered190 TANTRASĀRA 

to be the main. This is the view of our teachers. The best of last ing impressions is the conception of one's own identity with the supreme Lord.

The Procedure for (the Celebration of) Festival Days (Parvadinam)231 (Those days marked as a) festival day can be divided into general, general-general, general-special, special-general, special, and special-special; this is its sixfold division. This occasion is called a day of festivities (parva) because on that day the completion of a procedure (vidhi) is celebrated. The first and fifth days of every month are general occasions for festivities. The fourth, eighth, ninth, fourteenth, and fifteenth of both halves of the fortnight are general-general. Both these groups, because of their association with a particular constellation of stars and planets on different lunar days, which will be given later, become a general-special type of festival day (parvadinam). 

These are the days of special festivities: the first quarter of the ninth lunar night, or the dark fortnight of [the lunar month of] Margasirsa (November-December); [in the month] of Pausa (December-January) (the festival occurs at) the dark ninth lunar midnight; the midnight of Māgha (January-February) (it is at) the bright lunar fifteenth; at midday [of the month] of Phālguna (Feb ruary-March) [it is at the] bright lunar twelfth; of Caitra (March April), it is at the bright lunar thirteenth; in [the the month of] Vaiśākha (April-May) it is the dark eighth of the lunar day; in Jyaiṣtha (May-June) it is the dark ninth of the lunar day; [in the 

192 TANTRASĀRA 

month] of Āsādha (June-July) it is the first day; of Śrāvaṇa (July August) it is the previous portion of the day on the dark eleventh; of Bhadra (August-September) it is the bright sixth lunar mid day; of Asvina (September October) the bright ninth lunar day; of Kārtika (October November) the first portion of the night of the bright ninth. The star Citrā is associated with the moon; the star Māgha is associated with Jupiter; the star Tisya is associated with the moon; the star Pūrvaphālguni is associated with Mercury; the star Sravana, with Mercury; the star Satabhisa, with the moon; the star Mūla, with the sun; the star Rohini, with Venus; the star Visakha, with Jupiter; the star Śravaṇa, with the moon. If count ing the month Mārgaśīrṣa onward, the number of them becomes eleven excluding Asvina, then the parva is special-special. 

If any special occasion arises on any other festival day, then it is called anuparva. If an asterism (a grouping of astronomi cal objects) of a star and planet occurs, there is no importance [concerning the specific] time of the day, for the tithi itself is the bestower of auspiciousness. The main feature of performing ritu als during festival days is the continuity of the performance of the ritual called. The rituals performed on the festival days should be given dominance to anuyāga. The words mūrtiyāga and cakra yāga are its synonyms.232 

In this ritual, the teacher, his relations along with their sons, a knower of the truth, a daughter, an outcast woman, a prosti tute, a woman who is having her monthly period (aruṇā), and a woman who knows the truth should primarily be worshipped in cakrayāga. They should be worshipped individually and as a group. There, the teacher occupies the seat in the center, and cir cling him, either in a circle or in a row, beginning with the teacher and ending with the disciples, following the order of vira and śakti. Then, they should be worshipped individually with sandalwood paste, incense, flowers, etc. Then, the vessel should be contem plated as Sadaśiva, and, filling it with wine, it should be meditated upon as the nectar of śakti. Then, it should be worshipped as 

TANTRASĀRA 193 

Śiva, its enjoying power, and by her [the agent of enjoyment], the host of deities should be propitiated. Then, meditating on it as a unity of the triad, composed of the object (nara), the instrument (śakti), and the supreme subject (śiva), one should propitiate it in order to remove the layers of coverings (āvaraṇa). One should propitiate externally and internally in order to attain both enjoy ment and liberation. Then, the propitiation should be done in the reverse order. Thus, the complete circular movement nourishes and accomplishes the fullness of cakra. The vessel, in the form of the universe, should be placed on the base and then, from it, first propitiating the host of the deities, one should propitiate oneself with it. In the absence of the vesset one should shape the palm of his right hand in the shape of vessel (bhadra), and placing the palm of the right hand over the left one in such a way that no gaps are present. This is called vellitaśukti. By the falling of the drops of wine, the vetāla and guhyaka become pleased, and by the flow of it Bhairava is pleased. 

No person should be given entry into the place of worship. If, by mistake, [some person) enters there, one should not become doubtful. If one does become doubtful, then he should perform the circular ritual twice. After this, fried and pungent food should be placed abundantly before or inside the sacred house, not known to common people, and everybody should be made to unite and be named with term 'deity' (devata), excluding his personal name. This is the description of vīrasaṁkarayāga. Then finally they (the teacher, etc.) should be propitiated with offerings of food, betel, clothes, etc. This is the principle of mūrtiyāga. 

Even a person who has never seen the mandala, by worshipping during the days of the festivals (parvadinam) with the murti yāga ritual, obtains within a year the result of putraka initiation, without performing sandhyā and other rituals. This is the procedure for the elderly, those inclined to worldly enjoyment, and women. The teacher should give this kind of instruction only when the descent of grace occurs.

The Procedure Called Pavitraka,233 the Offering of the Sacred Thread 

The ritual "offering of the sacred thread' (pavitraka) is the ful fillment of the command of the Lord preceded by an injunction such as given in the Sriratnamālā, the Triśiromata, and the Srisiddhamata. As it is said in the Sri Tantrāloka: “Without the 'offering of the sacred thread' (pavitraka), everything is fruitless." Therefore, from the beginning of the lunar bright fortnight of the month of Aṣādha until the end of kularpūrṇimā, the full-moon night of māgha, this offering of the pavitraka is to be performed. In connection with it, on the fifteenth day of the dark night of Kārtika, kulacakra and nityacakra are to be performed. This is the opinion of the knowers of the Nitya Tantra. However, accord ing to the knowers of the Bhairava Kulormi Tantra, the pavitraka should be performed on the bright fifteenth night of māgha, while 

TANTRASĀRA 195 

according to the knowers of the Tantra Sadbhāva, it should be performed on the last fifteenth night of the southern movement of the sun, that is, the winter solstice (dakșiṇāyana). 

During that period, one should worship the Lord according to one's financial capabilities, and performing oblations into the fire, and then propitiating him, he should offer the pavitraka. The garland for the pavitraka may be made either of gold, pearl, or silk thread, cotton thread, or kusa grass. It may contain knots representing the thirty-six principles (tattvas). One garland should be made containing the number of knots of pada, kalā, bhuvana, 

· varṇa, and mantra which reaches to the end of the knee. Another 

one should be made to reach to the end of the navel, another to reach the throat, and another should be on the head. Thus four pavitrakas should be offered to the deity and to the teacher, while meditating for the purpose of the fulfillment of the entire path. One should be given to the remaining members of the group also. After completing the offering of pavitraka, one should have a great festival. One should perform the pavitraka for either seven or three days at the end of the four-month period (between mid July and mid-October), or once when there is a state of emer gency (an unfortunate event). If one is wealthy, he should perform the pavitraka every month; otherwise, during the period of four months as described above, or once. If one is unable to perform the pavitraka, he should repeat his mantra as atonement. A per son who is endowed with right knowledge and possesses riches, but refrains from the pavitraka, incurs a sin. Being polluted with greed, although learned, and abstaining from the pavitraka (he) disgraces knowledge. According to the following statement: 

One who corrupts the decrees of the Lord after obtain 

ing right knowledge must perform atonement. This is the description of the procedure of the pavitraka: 

ज्ञानलाभादौ लौकिकोत्सवान्तेऽपि सर्वत्र संविदुल्लासाधिक्यं देवताचक्रसंनिधिः विशेषतो भवति, इति तथाविधाधिक्यपर्यालोचनया तथाविधमेव विशेषमनुयागादौ कुर्यात् । 

196 TANTRASĀRA 

On the day of receiving knowledge, and also at the end of worldly festivals, the upsurge of consciousness becomes exceed ingly great. Therefore, the nearness of the host of deities becomes particularly great. Hence, considering the occurrence of such upsurge of consciousness, one should perform a specific addi tional form of the anuyāga, etc.

इति व्याख्याविधिः। The Procedure to Be Followed During the Exposition of the Sacred Text 234 One should worship the teacher, who is fully endowed with knowl edge regarding all sacred texts, and who should be cordially invited to expound the sacred texts.235 The teacher should explain the text to his disciples, or to the disciples of others, according to their mental development and aptitude. The teacher should explain the text, even to a person who is established in the lower doctrines, 

TANTRASĀRA 197 

out of compassion, while his heart is well-disposed with devo tional feelings toward the descent of grace caused by the diversity of the will belonging to the supreme Lord. However, the teacher should exclude the delicate points of secrets. 

As regards the exposition, it is prescribed that the recipient should be seated on a lower seat than the teacher, and the recipient should eagerly await receiving the knowledge, having also regu lated his speech, mind, and limbs. Only then does the teaching become fruitful. 

At first the ground should be smeared with the sandalwood paste on which a square should be drawn or imagined. That should be the base of the lotus; above it, three lotuses should be drawn. On the middle lotus, the goddess of speech (Vāgīśī), and to the left and to the right Ganapati and the guru should be worshipped. On the base lotus, the deity supervising [prevailing over] the subject explained [in the sacred text) should be worshipped. Then, one should propitiate the sacred diagram, offering from a water vessel. This being completed, the teacher should expound the text contain ing sūtras, sentences, and the section. The exposition should be uniform throughout, without contradicting earlier [statements] by later statements. The teacher should present the view of the oppo nent first, and should make use of 'principles of centralization' (tantra), “repetition (āvrtti), 'extended application (prasaṁga), 'figure of speech' (samuccaya), and 'admission of an alternative (vikalpa), which are accepted as logical and proper for the presen tation of the text. He should represent properly the viewpoint of the opponent first, and then by refuting it, he should arrive at the object aimed at by the ascertainment of the meaning of the expo sition. He should expound the whole of the section, but not more. Throughout the exposition, at the end of each subject, propitiation and worship of the deity should continue until the end of the expo sition. Then they should worship the seat of learning, and perform ing the ritual for withdrawal, the place should be smeared and all the material used should be thrown into deep water.

This completes the procedure of the 'exposition of the sacred 

texts.'

Freedom from Conventional (Samaya) Duties Although a person steadily established in knowledge does not require the performance of any rite such as atonement, etc., he does have the responsibility of showing the right path of conduct to those who conceive that only by performing rituals will they attain mokṣa. However, a person who is not a knower of the truth, and whose attainment of moksa and bhoga are thoroughly depen dent on the performance of ritual, transgresses the conventional rules (samaya) by not performing atonement, and [because of this] undergoes suffering for one hundred years and becomes an eater of corpses (pisaca). Therefore, the procedure of the rite of atonement should be explained. In regard to such person, there is no atonement for killing a woman. Regarding other forms of sin, considering the seriousness of the sin, one should repeat, with out interruption, goddess malini once or three hundred thousand times. This he should continue until he becomes free from doubt; that is, until the feeling of guilt is gone. Then, at the end, the special worship should be performed; and even on that occasion, cakrayāga should be performed. Cakrayāga is essentially per formed everywhere as the last ritual. 

TANTRASĀRA 199 

This is the procedure for the release from convention (samaya).

The Procedure for the Worship of the Spiritual Teacher (Guru)236 After all the pūjās are completed, and upon the day following the completion of the cakrayāga, one should then perform gurupūjā. Previously, the guru has been worshipped as ancillary to the rites, but now he should be worshipped as the main object of worship. However, the worship of the teacher not being performed as the principal object of worship, one remains bound by the bond of operating the functional rite [one is bound by his own entitlement performing it). Therefore, the gurupūjā should be performed in every respect. 

One should first draw the sacred diagram named svāstika, and should offer a golden seat there. After this, worshipping all the paths in it, the teacher should be seated upon it, and worshipping him, one should propitiate him with offering of water, food, and money. Then, surrendering oneself to him, one offers praise for the remains of his food, and (after] consuming it, he then pros200 TANTRASĀRA 

trates before the teacher in obeisance, and then should perform cakrapūjā. 

This is the procedure related to the worship of a teacher: 

The person who performs the indispensable (nitya) and occasional observances (naimittika), etc., showing no misery, attains liberation only by the practice of ritu als, without having knowledge of the truth, or taking recourse to yoga.

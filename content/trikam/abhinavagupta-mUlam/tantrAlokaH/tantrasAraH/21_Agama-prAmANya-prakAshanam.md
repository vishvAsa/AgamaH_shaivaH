Chapter Twenty-One Thus, all the rituals of the indispensable (nitya) and occasional observances (naimittika) have been described. Next, the evidence of this āgama237 will be elaborated. This universe is composed solely of consciousness, which abides in a consciousness charac terized by reflective awareness (vimarśa), which has been ascer tained to be its inner verbalization or articulation (śabdana).238 Šāstra, the sacred text, is of the nature of reflective awareness

manifesting itself in the form of all substances existing in this uni verse, along with the diversity of the relations of deeds and their results. Therefore, the entire corpus of sacred texts is not differ ent from the very nature of the Lord. In reality, it is the giver of one fruit, but because of the regulating power (niyati) of the Lord, people are strongly attached to its various divisions for the fulfill ment of more than one purpose. Some are strongly inclined to the Vedas, having the characteristic cognition of duality born of māyā Others who are also like them are strongly attached to Sāmkhya and Vaisnava doctrines with erroneous notions concerning libera tion. Still others are attached to Saiva Siddhanta, etc., which is, in esser e, the reflective consciousness of the nature of transcendent śiva. Others are attached to the Matamga āgamas, etc., which is characterized by the reflective consciousness of immanent śiva. But some, the rarest of the rare, are deeply attached to the doc trines of the Trika school,239 characterized by the reflective con sciousness of the nature of the great Lord, free from all limi tations, whose highest essence is freedom and bliss, and who is composed of pure consciousness. Yet others, also forsaking the former, and also the latter, either leaving it or transcending it, thus attain the accomplishment of a single purpose by following only one āgama.

Even in dualistic doctrines, it is accepted that all the āgamas, being the creation of one Lord, are considered to be authorita tive. Depending on the validity, in one place non-contradictory harmony regarding truth with harmony occurs, and as a result one is inclined to some activity; while thinking that it is not so, one becomes disinclined. Therefore, they are similar. Mutual opposi tion with a difference of subject matter is of no account. Killing a brahmana and the prohibition of it are like the difference between purity and excellence of the soul. In the absence of saṁskāra, one fails to earn the right to follow the code of conduct. 

Therefore, the argument is the same for both, like a difference of aśramas. It is said that the excellence of any action is deter mined by the excellence of its fruit, like the Upaniṣadic portion of the Vedas.240 

If we admit that all the sacred texts (śāstras) were created by different authors, even then we may suppose that all the śāstras were created by omniscient authors. This is because the āgamas are associated with the concepts explained by omniscient authors, 

TANTRASĀRA 203 

as well as other relevant matters. If the eternality of agama be sup posed, even then the logical arguments, i.e., anvaya and vyatireka, perception, etc., as well as their validity, are grounded in tradi tion (prasiddhi).241 A notion such as “I see real silver” depends on somebody else's knowledge, as in this case on a goldsmith's knowledge. 

Therefore, the tradition (prasiddhi) is agama. To some, it gives a perceptible result, as, for example, one who is hungry eats. A child becomes engaged with each individual object only because of being impelled by prasiddhi, and not by the logical connec tion of cause and effect, and its negation. At that age, there is an absence of logic, etc. Furthermore, at that age, its presence is of little use. Inference of the logical connection of cause and effect, and its negation, taking recourse to prasiddhi, are required for the accomplishment of some action. Some prasiddhis are the givers of unseen results, such as emancipation after death, dissolution in prakrti, and emancipation of the soul. Other prasiddhis bestow similarity with śiva, while others terminate in the oneness [with Śiva]. These seen and unseen results are again manifold. There fore, in this world full of different traditions (prasiddhis), what ever state a person will have in the future, he selects that kind of prasiddhi and is forced to accept it as something highly desirable (or undesirable). For this reason, what would be the purpose of verbal argument in regard to a person who is quite empty? From among those prasiddhis, one should be taken as valid, and the validity of that agama should be accepted. Therefore, a person should take recourse to whichever agama grants excellent results. What could be the purpose of further arguments? 

: 

As the wise person considers the light of the conscious ness shining as supreme reality, in the same way, he is aware of self-consciousness. Therefore, one should take recourse to that holy text which is the essence of the intuitive light of reflective consciousness characterized by the all-inclusiveness of anuttara.

A person exists in the behavior devised by his own con viction of common usage, but only becomes free from doubts when he becomes the supreme Lord, after attain ing steadiness in the highest prasiddhi, the transcendent.

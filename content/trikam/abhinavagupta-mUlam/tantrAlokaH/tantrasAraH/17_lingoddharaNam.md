Chapter Seventeen Reclamation of the linga[^219] 

The following is the procedure of initiation for those who belong to orders beginning with Vaisnava, etc., and ending with southern doctrines, or those who have followed religious codes of conduct conforming to other orders, and also those who, although being established in the highest doctrine, are engaged in attending a teacher who belongs to a lower order, when they are made inclined [to receive initiation) by the descent of the grace of the Lord. 

Such a person should fast the day before initiation, and then the following day, after worshipping the Lord in a general way, he180 TANTRASĀRA 

should be brought into the presence of the Lord, and his all past deeds should be recounted before him. Then, on receiving his mantra from a teacher, the mantra he received from other teachers should be thrown into the water. Next, he should be bathed, then sprinkled with water from a vessel, purified with food cooked in a sacred fire (caru), and [his mouth cleaned with a] tooth stick, and should enter the place of the ritual blindfolded. He should worship the great Lord with the general mantras.[^420] After this, one should purify his vrata/mantra in the fire transformed into śiva using the general mantras. Then, placing his name between 

the mantra (as prefix and suffix) saying, "I purify his expiation," . and ending with 'svāhā, he should offer oblation one hundred 

times. Next with 'vausat,' he should offer the final oblation. After this, he should evoke the lord of vrata (Vrateśvara) and offer puri fied butter into the fire. Then, by the order of śiva in regard to the disciple: "You, Vrateśvara, be impartial to him, and do not cause obstacles for him," should make the deity aware of it. Hav ing prayed in this way, he should propitiate Vrateśvara and then take leave of the fire. This is the method for the reclamation of the linga. Then other purificatory rites should be performed as before. Now the disciple is ready to give dikṣā according to his will. 

When a person remaining in the lower order, being keenly touched by the power of the Lord, becomes inclined to approach the true teacher, he should, after purification, be given initiation even though he was for merly engaged with a false teacher.

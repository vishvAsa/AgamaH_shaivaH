Chapter Eleven 

Whatever has been stated up to now[^174] can serve some as a direct means for the attainment of liberation (apavargāptaye) using the 'short-cut method' explained above. On the other hand, the instruction given above can also lead others to initiation (diksā), performance of the rituals, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to give an account of the nature of initiation (dikșā), rituals, and so on. 

Here the question arises: Who is entitled to receive initia tion? In order to answer this question, the topic of the 'descent of grace' (śaktipāta) is going to be discussed. Some are of the opin ion that worldly existence, which is rooted in ignorance, occurs as a result of a lack of knowledge, but when ignorance is removed upon the rise of knowledge, 17s the descent of grace takes place However, they should explain why and how this right knowledge develops. If it is the outcome of deeds, then it would not be dif ferent from the results of actions; it would be a contingency of being an object of enjoyment. If the person who is the enjoyer (enjoying an object) is accepted as the recipient of grace, then the 'fallacy of wideness' (atiprasanga) occurs. If the will of the Lord is supposed to be the cause of śaktipāta, then the 'fallacy of mutual dependence' (anyonyāsrayatā) occurs and, moreover it serves no purpose. This theory would also entail the question of the Lord's partiality. Furthermore, it is not tenable to assume that mutually opposed actions, having equal capacity to suppress each other, could balance (past) actions in order that the descent of grace might occur.176 This view is not tenable because actions are sequential and therefore are unable to oppose one another. Even if it is accepted that they might oppose each other, the ques tion is raised as to how other actions, which are not opposing one another, bestow their results. If actions that are not contradictory to one another do not occur, then one would instantaneously drop one's body. It is not correct to say that only the actions bestow ing the results of birth and life span are not suspended, and that only those acts that grant experiences of happiness and suffer 

TANTRASĀRA 141 

ing remain suspended. This view is incorrect because it does not answer the question of why, even if it is assumed that the descent of grace occurs in the presence of such actions, grace is afraid of the deeds that bestow the results of experience. Furthermore, if the question of grace could be satisfactorily resolved by resorting to the theory of the ripening of impurities, 177 then the question of the nature of this theory needs to be answered, as well as the question of its cause. By this question, all possible causes, such as detachment, specific form of merit, service to righteous people, association with saintly persons, and the worship of deities stand refuted. Thus, arguments advanced by dualists are repudiated as incoherent. 

According to this nondual system of the autonomous Lord, we maintain the position that the great Lord, by way of sportful play, veils his innate nature and takes up the form of a bound being (paśu); however, there is no contradiction regarding the distinc tion of space, time, and his innate nature.178 Similarly, the Lord, by removing (the freely chosen) limitations upon his innate nature, reveals himself either instantaneously179 or gradually180 to that recipient of grace called a limited knowing subject (aṇu).181 The great Lord is in essence autonomous, and it is He who causes śakti to descend; therefore, the descent of grace, which is dependent on nothing, becomes fruitful by the realization of one's innate nature. However, for one desirous of enjoyment (bhogotsukasya), the descent of grace depends on his deeds. Upon one desirous of otherworldly enjoyments (lokottararūpabhogotsukasya), grace descends through the agency of Rudra, Viṣṇu, and Brahmā, the presiding authorities functioning in the sphere of māyā, [who are] impelled only by the will of the supreme Lord. This kind of grace yields results such as the attainment of the status of mantra know ing subject (mantrapramātā), etc., and (the capacity for) discrimi nation between the principles of] māyā and puruṣa, puruṣa and kalā, puruṣa and prakrti, and purusa and buddhi, and thus bars that kind of person from enjoying those fruits belonging to the lower principles. For one desirous of enjoyment and liberation, the 

142 TANTRASĀRA 

descent of grace has to depend on rituals when it comes to enjoy ments and is dependent on nothing when it comes to liberation; therefore, the descent of grace is both dependent and non-depen dent. It is not proper to ask why the descent of grace occurs only for that particular person. This is simply because the great Lord shines in that particular way. This being the case, then to which person might this kind of injunction related to the enjoyment of) some object be directed?182

The descent of grace is ninefold, with three variants: intense, moderate, and slow, combined with a further threefold division: supremely intense, moderately intense, and mildly intense. The occurrence of supremely intense descent of grace results in the fall of the body, whereupon the state of Parameśvara is attained. With the descent of moderately intense grace, the recipient is himself firmly convinced of the nature of reality and does not require any aid either from the scriptures or from a teacher. In him, intuitive knowledge opens automatically (pratibhajnanodayah), where upon, without undergoing external forms of purificatory rites, he becomes the giver of enjoyment and liberation to others. This kind of recipient of grace is called a teacher of prātibhā type. This person is not required to observe any customary behavior as used 

144 TANTRASĀRA 

in society. Even among the prātibhā type there may be the possi bility of comparative distinctions among recipients of grace. This is because of the diverse nature of the will of the Lord. Though being intuitive by nature, the person endowed with this type of grace may rely on the scriptures; this he does only for the verifica tion of truth. Thus, some teachers belonging to the prātibhā type may not be established in the śāstras, while others may be well established in scriptural knowledge. Therefore, they are of vari ous types, but in all the cases the element of intuition (pratibha) reigns supreme. In the presence of the teachers of the prātibhā type, other teachers have no authority. Just as in dualist systems (Saiva Siddhānta), śivas.who have attained liberation are unable to perform the functions of creation, destruction, etc., 'in the pres ence of the beginingless śiva. 

From the descent of mildly intense grace, a desire to approach a right kind of teacher183 develops, while one's leanings in the direction of incompetent: teachers disappear. It is only because of grace that one goes toward the right kind of teacher from an incompetent one. The true teacher is fully conversant with the entire truth contained in śāstras. He is none other than the revered Lord Bhairava. Even a yogin is the giver of release to others only through the knowledge gained by practice. In this regard, his com petency as teacher comes from his identity with śiva, while the loveliness and charm that he might possess are not essential. The incompetent teacher might possess all these other qualities except union with śiva. 

Thus, the person who feels a desire to approach (such a] teacher receives initiation, characterized by knowledge, through which he immediately attains liberation while still living (jivanmukti). This initiation takes place in different ways: by mere glance (avalo kana), through discourse, by enlightening the disciple regard ing śāstras, by means of viewing external rites, or by offering semen and menstrual fluids. A person well practiced in meditation, etc., receives initiation at that time which severs the bond of vital energy (prāṇa); however, this kind of initiation should be given 

TANTRASĀRA 145 

only at the time of death. This particular type of initiation will be explained later. Thus, the intense type of descent of grace is of a threefold nature. 

One who receives initiation as a result of supremely moder ate grace does not feel a deep conviction regarding his identity with śiva. However, by gradual ripening of that realization, he becomes śiva after he drops his body. One upon whom grace descends in a moderately moderate manner, although eager to attain śivahood, is overwhelmed by the desire for enjoyment. In spite of this, this kind of person is a recipient of the pure knowl edge granted to him through initiation: He, in the present body, experiences enjoyments obtained by the practice of yoga and becomes Śiva at the time of dropping his body. From the mildly moderate descent of grace one attains śivahood only after experi encing enjoyments in another body after dropping the present one. Thus, the moderate type of grace is also threefold. 

When a person's eagerness for the enjoyment of pleasures dom inates, then the nature of grace is said to be slow. The recipient of this grace becomes eager to attain identity with supreme Lord through the means of yoga, such as repetition of mantra; because mantras and the practice of yoga finally terminate in liberation, they are decidedly of the nature of grace. Here also, as a result of comparative distinction, the mild descent of grace is threefold. These are the main principles of the descent of grace. Regard ing Vaisnavas and other systems, the descent of grace is like the grace of the king and therefore does not culminate in liberation; therefore, this type is not going to be discussed here. It has already been stated that in every descent of grace, śakti abides as insepara ble from śiva; however, this cannot be the 'supreme one' (jyeșthā), but either fearsome (ghorā) or dreadful (ghoratamā).184 Although already diverse, the descent of grace becomes further differenti ated by means of comparative gradation. A person belonging to the Vaisnava and other orders, who follows the method prescribed by the teacher but at the same time follows this sāstra of the five fold current, becomes in due order sufficiently mature and is able 

146 TANTRASĀRA 

to gain the highest competency for receiving the Trika, the all transcending and supreme sāstra, which is revealed by the Lord. Others attain (the highest competency for receiving the Trika) by skipping some stages, thus creating indefinite divisions. Yet oth ers may attain (the same competency) instantaneously, i.e., with out any sequence (akrama). Thus, teachers belonging to the lower orders are not entitled even to see the sacred diagram (mandala), while the teacher belonging to the higher orders is instrumental in enlivening the lower doctrines. He is able to do this because, on account of his perfection, he is entitled to all the sāstras. This kind of person is a teacher (daisika), a guide (guruh), one who fol lows the rules and teaches others to follow them (ācārya), an ini tiator (dikṣakah), or a voracious reader (cumbakah). Among them, the best one is that one in whom the fullness of knowledge has completely flourished, without which the fulfillment of initiation, etc., would be impossible. 

A yogin who is associated with a person desirous of attain ing results is capable of granting him immediate results by instructing him to adopt a certain means (upaya) which will lead him to his goal. If that person, through the means taught to him, remains concentrated only on knowledge, then he may also attain liberation. A person desirous of having perfect knowl edge should approach many teachers; he should remain close to them, hoping to attain ever more superior knowledge of different kinds. However, abandoning a teacher perfect in knowledge defi nitely requires a need for expiation (prāyaścitta). The question might arise: What if the teacher does not give instruction, or he gives erroneous instruction; shouldn't one abandon him? To that we reply, “no," as that kind of teacher is free from attachment because he has attained perfect knowledge and therefore has no personal reasons for not revealing secrets. The teacher's silence might be the result of lack of merit on the side of disciple or for want of a surrendering spirit in the disciple. This disciple should continue to make an effort to serve this kind of teacher and should not abandon him. Thus, the descent of energy, having grace as 

TANTRASĀRA 147 

its purpose, is indeed independent. If the descent of grace were dependent on bad or good deeds, or restrictive causal laws (niyati), then it would be nothing but the function of veiling belonging to the Lord (tirobhāva).

भूयो बुध्येत वा सोऽयं शक्तिपातोऽनपेक्षकः || इति श्रीमदभिनवगुप्ताचार्यविरचिते तन्त्रसारे शक्तिपातप्रकाशनं नाम एकादशमाह्निकम् ।। 

Veiling' or tirobhāva is indeed dependent on deeds, and it can create such a situation as making one experience intense unhap piness and delusion. For instance, because of the free will of the light (prakāśasvātantryād), a perfectly enlightened person can behave like he is truly foolish and then blame that behavior on being foolish at heart. Similarly, a foolish person can imitate the behavior of an enlightened one, such as usage of the mantra in worship, etc., and then blame it (on the behavior of an enlightened one). However, compared to an enlightened one, the activities per 

148 TANTRASĀRA 

formed by a dullard, suited to an unenlightened one, although performed, decline and finally end. The activity of an enlightened one, being blamed as a forbidden behavior, makes the unenlight ened become doubtful of his potency, which is the functioning of the 'power of veiling' (tirobhāvaśakti). This causes an enlightened one to sink into the morass of delusion. 

This veiling has no effect on a person upon whom grace has fallen. In this instance, as in the previous example, it is not depen dent on deeds. In all of the following cases, because of the diver sity of the will of the Lord, tirobhāva persists: it results in suffer ing to be experienced only in this body; or in initiation followed by practice according to convention, such as serving a teacher, a deity, or sacrificial fire; or finding fault with them, like those engaged in service or blame; or like those who were engaged in a doctrinal order of śiva, and who later abandon it. Even in these examples of being influenced by tirobhāva, one may himself receive the descent of grace as a result of the wonderful manifes tation of Lord's will, or one may receive grace even after death through his teacher or relative. Thus, one is the sharer of the five functions of the Lord coherently united in one's own self. There fore, he is none other but Parameśvara and should not think of himself as being separate from him. 

The Lord, who by nature is without any veil, covers his nature of light by his freedom of will; in the same way he unfolds it as well. In the domain of his non-enlight ened state, he behaves like an enlightened one and later wakes up. The nature of the descent of grace is to be independent.

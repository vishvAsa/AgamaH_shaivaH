Chapter Eighteen The anointment (abhiseka) 

The person in whom maturity of knowledge has developed should be given anointment in order to follow the course of a sādhaka, or to become a spiritual guide (guru) to others. This is because only the person who possesses knowledge, even though devoid of all the other characteristic qualities, has earned the authority to follow the course of a sādhaka, or to bestow grace on others, even though he might have received anointment.[^221] If the teacher not perfect in knowledge abstains from giving initiation, he does not incur sin. However, the former one, who possesses knowledge, incurs sin because he is duty-bound, for he is consid ered to be the bestower of the status of the lord of vidyā. Therefore, being of such nature, if he abstains from giving initiation, this is his sin. 

After anointment for the purpose of fulfillment of identity between the mantra and the deity, the new teacher should observe the regular rituals of mantra every day for a period of six months through the repetition of mantra, oblation into the fire, and per 

182 TANTRASĀRA 

formance of specific worship.[^222] From then on, being one with the desired deity, he earns the right and authority of giving initiation, etc., to others. However, he should not initiate an unworthy one, nor should he avoid one who is worthy.[^223] Even the initiated one should be tested by a teacher while bestowing knowledge. The person who receives knowledge deceitfully should be looked at with indifference after this is known to be so. In this anointment, worship of the deities should be performed in accordance with the financial capacity of the person concerned. 

The person who himself is well practiced in knowledge 

• and bears the authority in himself, and is able to trans 

· mit that knowledge to others, possesses the nature of a sādhaka on the way to becoming a spiritual guide. Such a person should be given anointment.

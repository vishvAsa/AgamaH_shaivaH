Chapter Ten [In the previous chapter], the path of principles (tattvas) has been explained. Now the path called kalā, the subtle units of tattvas, etc., will be described. It has already been stated that the specific character which threads through all the worlds is called 'prin ciple' (tattva). In the same way, that which invariably abides in the group of tattvas is named kalā. This is because kalā is capable of fashioning or shaping (kalana) in a uniform way; for example, in regard to the principle earth, it is nivrtti because a process of the creation of the principles stops with it.[^166] 

The kalā named pratiṣthā functions in the group of tattvas beginning with water and ending with pradhāna because it is instrumental in nourishing and replenishing. The kalā named vidyā functions in the group of tattvas beginning with purușa and ending with māyā, because of which knowables begin to diminish and the ascension of consciousness occurs. From pure vidyā to the end of śaktitattva the śāntākalā operates. Due to its function, the activity of veils (kañcukas) rest in tranquility. Therefore, there are four spheres[^167] (andas): born of earth (pārthiva), born of prakrti (prāksta), born of māyā (mayīya), and born of śakti (sāktā). The energies belonging to the earth and other tattvas have their abode

in these spheres up to the end of the principle called śakti; there fore, in the principle śakti subtle tactile contact exists. [^168] Tactile contact possesses the nature of resistance, and therefore it is rea sonable to conclude that the spherical worlds exist up to the end of the śakti principle. Furthermore, in the śivatattva, there is the concived kalā called sāntātītā whose existence is created only for the purposes of instruction, meditation, and worship.[^169] The supreme reality possesses absolute freedom; however, even there, that which is beyond the scope of knowledge is also beyond kalā (kalātīta).[^170] Thus, the number of kalās is indeed five and the num ber of tattvas is thirty-six. . . . . . .

त्रयमुक्तं संग्रहाय शिष्येभ्यः ||३|| The knowable is twofold; following its division into gross and subtle qualities, the total number of tattvas becomes ten. Instrumentality is also twofold: first, there is pure instrumentality, and second, instrumen tality is connected with agenthood. Thus, the number of tattvas also becomes ten. Next to them are five tat tvas where instrumentality has become subordinate and agenthood has become distinctly prominent. Next come five tattvas that are the result of the purity of agent hood. The next five tattvas are those whose distinction from one another dissolves with the intention toward fullness. The thirty-sixth is the principle known as śiva, who is free from all limitations. When this is taught or meditated upon, that in which the mind gets a solid base is called the thirty-seventh principle. When this princi ple is also made an object of meditation, then the num ber of principles becomes thirty-eight; this does not involve infinite regress, however, because when śiva, who is associated with unlimited freedom, is being meditated upon, it terminates in the thirty-seventh tat tva.171 However, the thirty-sixth principle has to be con ceived of as beyond all other principles. Here ends the method of conceiving (grouping] all principles under 

the scheme of five kalās. When ātmākalā extends up to vijñānākalā, and vijñānākalā extends up to Isvara, and the remaining tattvas are pervaded by śiva, this is the method of conceiving all the tattvas under the 

138 TANTRASĀRA 

threefold scheme. The same scheme should also be assumed in regard to nine tattvas. 172 

The threefold division of the sixfold path, in the form of the worlds (bhuvanas), principles (tattvas), and kalās, which are of the nature of gross, subtler, and subtlest, is on the side of objectiv ity. When, on the other hand, it takes its repose (viśranti) in the subject, the division is similarly threefold.173 When it shines as the instrument of knowledge in this subjective aspect, then it is called the path of pada. But when the waves of agitation in the instru ment of knowledge are going to rest, then it is called the path of mantra. When, on the other hand, the agitation is completely paci fied in the fullness of subjectivity, then the path is that of varṇa. ... When that very varna takes rest in its fullness, it attains its own nature. Therefore, it is proper to conclude that one path possesses sixfold divisions. . . 

The number of pada, mantra, and varna is one, and the number of the worlds is sixteen; thus, the princi ple earth is composed of the kalā called nivstti. The fire is number three and the eye is number two; there fore, the number of principles from water to prakrti is twenty-three. The word rasa signifies number six and sara number five; therefore, the number of the words is fifty-six. This is pratisthākalā. The number of syllables constituting the principles from puruṣa to māyā are seven. The number of mantras and padas is two, while the number of the worlds is twenty eight. This is vidyākalā. The number of principles are three, that is, śuddhavidyā, iśvara, and sadāśiva. The mantra here consists of three syllables, while the num ber of the worlds is eighteen. This is śāntākalā. 

The number of pada, mantra, and principles (tattva) is one, while the number of syllables is sixteen. This is santātītākalā. These three verses in āryā meter have been composed by Abhinavagupta for the use of his students.

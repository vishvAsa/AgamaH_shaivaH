When a discursive thought (vikalpa) is capable of purifying itself in itself without depending on other means, it loses the functionality which is commonly associated with bonded beings (pasu).[^49]   
Then, by the grace of pure knowledge (Suddhavidyā), it (vikalpa) becomes transformed into the energy of the great Lord, and after taking recourse to it as the 'means' (upāya), it becomes capable of manifesting the knowledge belonging to śakti (śākta).  
This process was explained in the previous chapter.

[^49]:

    The term "bound soul” (paśu), which literally means animal, is a technical term of this system. With the appearance of limitation, the soul, which is essentially composed of pure consciousness, finds itself limited in knowledge and action.+++(5)+++ Its innate nature becomes as if veiled, for which reason it becomes known as atomic (anu).+++(5)+++

    At this level of existence the bonded souls are of great variety because they receive the grace of the Lord, which is based on comparative distinctions of intensity. The right form of intuitive judgment does not arise in all. Therefore, they have to depend on āgama for the rise of that intuitive knowledge. At this stage, there is a need for a spiritual guide.+++(4)+++ A spiritual guide is a person meant to lead the seeker in selecting an appropriate agama for him to study. When the agama is studied properly, pure thought (śuddha vikalpa) arises.  

    However, in the case of those who lack right understanding, purification of thoughts (vikalpas) in this particular way is not possible. Therefore, they need to rely on other means for that purification of thoughts (vikalpas). In short, these means are: meditation, taking recourse to the vital energy (prāṇa), and making the body the instrument of knowledge as a means to attain one's ends.

    The body itself is a gross instrument for the attainment of the highest aim of life. For those who are steadily convinced that a body is the Self, it becomes a suitable means.

## विकल्प-संस्कारः

यदा तु **उपायान्तरम्** असौ स्वसंस्कारार्थं **विकल्पो ऽपेक्षते**,

**आणवं ज्ञानम्** आविर् भावयति।+++(5)+++  

<details><summary>English</summary>

When, for the purification of discursive thought (vikalpa), one needs to rely on the 'means' (upāya), then he or she can take recourse in the intellect (buddhi), prāṇa, body, jar, and other external objects of a limited nature.[^50] By doing this, one descends to the level of an atom (aṇu) and causes the 'knowledge of limited nature' (āṇava) to manifest in his soul.

[^50]:

    Meditation is performed by the intellect (buddhi). This kind of practice is fruitful for those who think that intellect is the Self. 

    On the other hand, those who are convinced that the vital air (prāṇa) is the Self make the prāṇa a means. In order to remove vikalpas, the aspirant makes use of body (karaṇa), mudra, and different sorts of āsanas.

<details><summary>English</summary>

On that level the buddhi possesses a meditative nature,

and prana is of two kinds:[^51] gross and subtle.  
The former is of the nature of moving upward (uccārana). This moving upward possesses five modalities: prāṇa, apāna, samāna, udāna, and vyāna.  
The subtle form of prāṇa is denoted by the syllabic sound (varṇa), which will be explained later.

[^51]:

    Vital energy is of two types, one general and the other particular. 

    The particular form of the vital air manifests itself in five different ways. They are known as prāṇa, apāna, samāna, udāna, and vyāna. These particular forms of vital energy, although manifested distinctly in these five ways and functioning in different parts of the body, are basically resting in the general form of vital air. Their basic nature is to move forward (uccārana).

    The general prāṇa is known as vibration (spanda), pulsation, blossoming, etc. At the start of the creative impulse, after manifestation of void, the consciousness assumes the nature of vital energy.


The body, possessing a specific type of arrangement, is denoted by the word karaṇa.[^52]

[^52]: Karaṇa is a particular type of ānava upāya which relates to the meditation on the body, etc.

Jars and so forth are external objects, which will be described as the means for the purpose of worshipping the altar and the phallic form (linga).

## ध्यानम्

तत्र ध्यानं तावद् इह +उचितम् उपदेक्ष्यामः।  
यद् एतत् स्वप्रकाशं सर्व-तत्त्वान्तर्-भूतं परं तत्त्वम् उक्तं, तद् एव निज-हृदय-बोधे ध्यात्वा, तत्र **प्रमातृ-प्रमाण-प्रमेय-रूपस्य वह्न्य्-अर्क-सोम-त्रितयस्य सङ्घट्टं ध्यायेत्**।+++(5)+++  

<details><summary>English</summary>

Among all of these means, it is appropriate to give instruction regarding meditation first.It has already been pointed out that the self-shining supreme reality exists externally in all the principles (tattvas).

Having meditated on that supreme reality in the heart of one's own consciousness, [^53] one should then meditate on the close union of the three, which are fire, the sun, and the moon. In this context, fire stands for the knowing subject, the sun for the instrument of knowledge, and the moon for the knowable objects.

[^53]:

    The supreme consciousness is self-luminous by nature. It is only because of its autonomy that it takes on the nature of everything.+++(5)+++ In other words, we can say that it shines in multifarious forms. One should meditate in the core of one's heart because the heart is the essence of all the principles, which abide closest to the heart. 

    First of all the aspirant should meditate with concentration on the uni-flavoredness (samarasya) of prāṇa, apāna, and udāna, represent ing the moon, the sun, and the fire.+++(4)+++ This meditation is to be performed by stopping the outgoing and ingoing movement of vital air in such a way that prāṇa, apāna, and udāna, after giving up the functioning in their respective manners, become one, leaving out all distinctions. 

    As fire blazes up with the churning process of araṇi, in a similar way, the opposing movement of both prāṇa and apāna, being stopped, enters into the current in the middle path, which transforms it into the fire of udāna, known as the great terrible fire blazing upward. This fire is known as the great fire because it consumes the limitedness of the conscious subject, its object, and its instrument of knowledge. Thus, with attaining perfection in such meditation, the meditator becomes free from all limitations and then he makes an effort to attain oneness with the highest subject.

<details><summary>English</summary>

One should meditate in this way as long as Bhairava's fire is not manifested by the fanning of the air in the form of meditation.

This fire is to be conceived as being encompassed by the aforesaid twelve flames of energy,[^54] assuming the form of the "wheel," out of which these energies emerge through one of the outlets, such as the eyes, and take their repose on the objective level.

[^54]:

    The highest subject is supposed to be encircled with twelve energies. They are associated with creation, maintenance, dissolution, and the fourth one designated as nameless (anākhyā). This nameless one, being without limitations, is associated with each of the other three. Therefore the number becomes twelve. They are as follows: 

    - (a) sr̥ṣṭi-sr̥ṣṭi, sr̥ṣṭi-sthiti, sr̥ṣṭi-samhāra, sr̥ṣṭi-anākhyā 
    - (b) sthiti sr̥ṣṭi, sthiti-sthiti, sthiti-samhāra, sthiti-anākhyā 
    - (c) saṁhāra-sr̥ṣṭi, samhāra-sthiti, saṁhāra-saṁhāra, samhāra-anākhyā.

While it is resting on the objective level,  
one should first conceive of it as being externally replenished by the moon in the order of creation.  
Then, it should be conceived of as being made manifest by the sun in the order of maintenance.  
Further, it should be conceived as being made to dissolve by the all-encompassing fire of withdrawal.[^55]  
Finally, it should be conceived of as being merged into transcendence in order to become one with it.


[^55]:

    The transcendent wheel (anuttara cakra) consisting of twelvefold nature, going outside through the outlets of the eye, etc., assumes the nature of the object. This object is characterized by the moon; the sense organs, representing the sun, are the instrument of knowledge (pramāṇa); while the knowing subject is the fire.+++(5)+++

<details><summary>English</summary>

In this way, the "wheel" attains fullness with no difference from objective existence.  
Then, one should meditate by means of that “wheel" on the residual traces that remain from the entities, and should dissolve them in a similar fashion.[^56]

[^56]: After the destruction of all the objects, they remain existent in the form of residual traces. Therefore, they should also be placed into the flames of the fire of consciousness.

The person who persists with this practice of meditation attains the firm conviction that the series of creation, maintenance, and dissolution are in essence nothing but his own consciousness, which in reality is freedom (svātantrya), shining as creation belonging to one's own innate consciousness.  
In this way, one realizes the state of Bhairava without delay.

However, it is only through practice that one attains all sorts of desired goals.

Now, the topic related to the 'upward movement' (uccārana) of the vital energy (prāṇa):

One desirous of moving his vital energy upward (uccāra) should first make it rest (viśrānti) in the heart,[^57] the void,  
and then through the rising of prāṇa should have it rest in external objects.



[^57]:

    While giving exposition of the mystery of uccāra related to the movement of the vital energy, the author states that due to this movement an unmanifest sound becomes manifest. This unmanifest sound is called unstruck sound (anāhata).+++(4)+++ Before the rise of prāṇa, the aspirant causes it for a moment to rest in his heart.

<details><summary>English</summary>

Thus, it is explained that all the 'stages of rest' (viśrānti) beginning with void (sūnya) and ending with vyāna, are all different stages of bliss. They are as follows: nijānanda, [^58] nirānanda, [^59] parānanda, [^60] brahmānanda, [^61] mahānanda, [^62] and cidānanda.[^63]


[^58]:

    By the term void (sūnya) negation is meant. This is the state of dissolution of all objects. The heart is known as the void where non-existence of any positive entity is possible. It is essentially of the nature of consciousness where bliss, the essence of it, remains perfectly blossoming. It is because of this nature that it is called innate blissfulness (nijānanda). The experiencing subject feels it as the very nature of the Self. With direct vision of one's own nature this blissfulness becomes manifest.


[^59]:

    At this level, as there is no existence of objectivity in any way, the experience of the delight that occurs there is called nirānanda. Then the energy of consciousness, after making the void manifest, assumes the nature of vital energy, which possesses dual form. On the one hand, prāṇa is insentient, and on the other it is sentient, for the Lord has made it distinct from other insentient objects by bestowing sentiency on it and has made it the experiencing subject. It experiences the bliss of its own (nijānanda), however, as the experiencing subject proceeds along the knowable objects touching the instrument of knowledge - In other words, when it becomes slightly inclined toward externality, then the bliss which remains associated with it is known as nirānanda. This is because it loses the earlier nature of blissfulness belonging to the experiencing subject alone. 

[^60]:

    Parānanda literally means the bliss belonging to the other. With the rise of the knowable, which occurs along with the rise of apāna, distinction or otherness shows itself. Therefore, the bliss that becomes manifest, at this stage, does not belong to the Self but to something distinct from it. It is for this reason that it is called parānanda. 

[^61]:

    On the level of samāna all the knowables become intermixed with : one another and show themselves as the unity of all. The delight that develops as a result of this is highly extensive and nourishing It is for this reason that a yogin experiences this particular kind of bliss as brahmānanda. 

[^62]:

    The number of the movements of the inhalation and exhalation is 21,600 during the period of 24 hours +++(net estimate - 20k)+++. When the yogin is able to dissolve the inhaling and exhaling breaths in the middle current (madhya mārga), only then the vital air known as prāṇa transforms itself and becomes udāna. When one is able to rest there, one experiences bliss abiding in the experiencing subject, which is quite distinct from nijānanda and other types of bliss. It is called mahānanda because of its greatness. 

[^63]:

    After one attains and experiences mahānanda, one advances further and as a result of the rise of vyāna, the great all-pervasive one, one experiences bliss free from all accidental attributes. This type of bliss is known as bliss of consciousness (cidānanda).

Universal bliss (jagadānanda) is the one blissful state, which unifies all the other six states mentioned above.  
This universal bliss is free from rising and setting, and is repose in one's own Self.

    - when the yogin utilizes the means related to the body to attain the highest reality, he experi ences a sort of delight which is the result of his intention toward fullness (pūrṇatā). The emergence of delight occurs only at his contact with fullness. When the yogin remains absorbed in that delightful state (even for moment), his firm conviction regarding his identity with body is severed as if with the flash of light of consciousness. 
    - Then he experiences a sudden "upward movement" known as “a jump upward” (udbhava). This takes place because the pull in the opposite direction becomes absent. 
    - As all the bonds functioning in the lower regions are cut off by the light, this upper pull leads the aspirant to feel and attain his own innate potency, the energy of which cuts off all the bonds of ignorance. This state is technically known as kampa, which literally means shaking. 
    - Then the state that follows is called nidrā. At this state all external sense organs cease to function, and even the internal ones stop to function properly. Hence he feels a kind of slumber which is a temporary state, for when he attains steadiness in pure consciousness, he experiences the immanence of consciousness and is able to realize that all, whatever that might be, is, in essence, consciousness. 
    - With this direct realization he wanders or whirls (ghūrṇate), that is, arrives at the state of vibrate consciousness, until finally the state of great pervasiveness (mahāvyāpti) begins to shine forth.
    - The effect of this is that his ignorance, which is his firm conviction in the form of conceiving the nonself as the self, is destroyed first. This is followed by the destruction of the conviction of conceiving the self as nonself. Finally, the yogin directly realizes the true nature of the Self.

    The five states like waking, etc., are related to the triangle centrally located in the mūlādhāra, where the delight is experienced. The bulb is the location of udbhāva, kampa is experienced in the heart, the palate is the place of the sleep (nidrā), while the whirl (ghūrṇi) is experienced at the end of twelve (dvādaśānta).+++(5)+++

That state, where the 'moving upward' (uccāra) of the vital energy has its repose (viśrānti),  
where the entity of knowables has dissolved into a 'transcendent vibration' (param-spandam),  
where knowables appear in a budding state,  
and where they where they have fully blossomed,  
(that state) is known as threefold linga.[^66]  
The nature of this three fold linga will be described when the occasion for that arises.


[^66]:

    The absolute state of the heart of repose which is attained through uccāra is technically known as unmanifest [linga]. This linga is of three types, i.e., avyakta, vyaktāvyakta, and vyakta.
    
    - Avyakta linga is characterized by absorption (līnam) where everything loses its individuality. However, it is only experienced while one remains unified with it. It is this state from which the universe emerges and where it finally goes to rest. 
    - The manifested-unmanifested (vyakta vyakta) form of linga is of the nature of absorption with highest reality, which shines in the form, “I am This." Therefore, it is related to the pure level of dynamic energy on the one hand, and on the other, to the objective world. 
    - The manifest (vyakta) linga is of the nature of cognition in which I-Consciousness becomes subordinated and manifests itself as if distinct from it and therefore shines as "This.” However, even at this level it does not lose its pure nature of consciousness.

Of the above, the principal one is characterized by vibration. When this vibration expresses itself in the form of contraction and expansion with the nature of the 'unity of the two' (yāmala), it attains repose with the form of the 'subtle emission' (visargakalā).

Now on the topic of 'syllabic sound' (varna), which is of the nature of subtle vital energy:   
In that 'upward movement' (uccāra) of the vital energy, there is a sound (dhvani), which is continuously sounding as if it is imitating the unmanifest.[^67] This sound is called 'syllabic sound' (varṇa). 

[^67]:

    The movement of vital energy is of two kinds. The first one is vibrative and natural, while the other is of the nature of activity and is born of effort. 
    
    The dynamic movement of the vital energy is ever associated with a sound which is known as unstruck sound (anāhata). It goes on sounding automatically in the heart of every living being. There is none to utter it or to stop it. All the phonemes abide inseparably in it. 
    
    Furthermore, yogins experience two tinct aspects of nāda. The first is ever shining which does not have any rest. It only rises once and remains shining forever. Another aspect of nāda is one which rises but which also sets. However, the subtle nāda where all the phonemes inseparably abide is known as the unmanifest sound. Two seed mantras (bījas) called sr̥ṣṭi and samhāra are its manifested forms. In other words, nada is cognized by the help of these seed syllables.+++(4)+++

One can attain supreme consciousness by the practice of these mantras.  
For example, when letters beginning with "ka” and ending with "ma,"[^68] either with or without vowels,  
are merged into the core of the vital energy or simply brought to memory,  
then one experiences a balanced state of vibration of consciousness. 

[^68]:

    These are the letters from "ka" varga to the end of “pa” varga. In this context they are used as mantras.

This is because the word, that is, mantra, is free from conventional relations (samaya)[^69] and therefore is full in every respect.

[^69]:

    Samaya is known as convention, i.e., a supposed relation between words and their meanings.

Even the words which depend on convention are also capable of conveying their respective meanings according to the imagination of one's mind.  
After one has experienced supreme consciousness (in this way] he should bring together the heart, the throat, the lips, and the two 'ends of the twelve' (dvādaśānta). Then, one should unify all of them in the core of 'consciousness' (hrdayam). This is the esoteric secret of this syllable (varṇa).

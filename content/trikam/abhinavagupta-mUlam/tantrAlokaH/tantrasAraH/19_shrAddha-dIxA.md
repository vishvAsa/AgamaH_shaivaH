Chapter Nineteen People, and even teachers, who followed lower doctrines should be given an initiation called the final purificatory rite' or 'last sacra 

ment' (antyasamskāra diksa),224 which should be performed fol lowing the procedure of reclaiming the dead, provided the descent of grace has touched them. The same applies to those who had fol lowed the order of the higher doctrines, but who have fallen from the right path and have not performed any rites of atonement. This is the command of the great Lord. 

All that was described as the procedure for the reclaiming of the dead should be performed on the corpse. The burning of the body is done as the final oblation. The teacher should perform the final rite for the dead person, for the confirmation of the faith (pratyaya) of the ignorant,225 according to his power of activ ity, knowledge, and yoga. Then, in the body of the deceased, the teacher should place the mantras (nyāsa) from the feet to the head, and, drawing the departed soul near by the application of the net, he should arrest it, penetrate it, stir it, and enliven it with the transmission of the vital energy to the heart, the throat, and on the forehead. In this way, the corpse begins to shake. Then, the rite

of the unification with the great Lord being performed, the body should be burnt as the final oblation. 

After this, the initiation called śrāddhadiksā226 should be per formed even for those who have been purified by means of the final rites of the dead, and also for those who have not been puri fied in this manner. For them, this final rite should be performed on the third or fourth day, every month, or every year. 

Then, completing the rite ending with oblation into the fire. one should take up a food offering in one of his hands and, con ceiving his power as the virile energy of the Lord representing the enjoyable object, which has assumed the power abiding in the limited self and has made her identity with it, contemplating thus, the performer should offer it to the great Lord, the supreme agent of the enjoyable object.227 

In this manner, when enjoyment ceases, one becomes indeed the master. Although by means of initiations, such as the rite for the dead, the reclamation of the body, and initiation during the śrāddha ceremony, one attains the fulfillment of one's aim in regard to those who are desirous of enjoyment, an abundance of ritualistic activities are performed for the attainment of a pleni tude of fruits. Therefore, all should be performed in regard to a person desirous of liberation for the attainment of oneness with the deity; this is performed daily throughout one's life, like other daily practices. But the knower of reality needs no procedure beginning with the final ritual for the dead (offering into the flame) and end ing with śrāddha, etc. The death of such a person is a 'day of festi val' (parvadinam) for the disciples, for it fulfills the shortcomings of consciousness of those who follow the lineage. The descendent of the teacher has a single end which, in essence, is nothing but the supreme reality. This day of ceremony is like the day of receiving the seed of the lineage from the teacher while he was alive. 

Everywhere in the ritualistic procedure of śrāddha, etc., the mūrtiyaga is the most important one. This is supported by the doc trine called Sri Siddhāmata. The procedure of it will be described in the naimittika section.

śiva is by nature inclined to show grace. Being so inclined, the person on whom He shows grace unavoid ably becomes identical with the Lord. It is merely his will by which the means (upāya) are imagined to be so. Though knowing this, the wise person takes recourse to means having limitations, and then he remains free from doubts.

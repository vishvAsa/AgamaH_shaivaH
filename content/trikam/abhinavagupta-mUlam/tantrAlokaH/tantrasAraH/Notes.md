    The day is the period when the sun shines and the moon, in the form of apāna, declines. For this reason, the day is conceived to be the period of the dark fortnight. Similarly, during the night, apāna, in the form of the moon, arises; therefore, the night is conceived as the bright fortnight. 

[^80]:

    There are two places of 'repose' (viśrānti), composed of half of a 

tuṭi each. They are in the center of the heart and at the end of the twelve' (dvādaśānta), free from the changing effects of time. Both locations are the junctions of prāṇa and apāna. The time unit for 

each of them is one tuṭi: 

[^81]:

    Here the concept of day and night is explained in a different way. 

The day is the period when manifestation of objects occurs; the 

night is that period when blissfulness becomes predominant. : 

[^82]:

    'The passage of a planet from one sign of the zodiac to another' 

(samkrānti), occurs in six sections each along the path of the vital breath. They are: makara, kumbha, mina, meșa, vrṣa, and mit huna, while on the other half they are: karka, simha, kānyā, tulā, vrscika, and dhanu. Similarly, the sun's progress towards the north and towards the south, respectively, is also conceived of as occur ring in the breath. The period during which the sun moves to the north is considered to be the bestower of good results in the other world, while the period during which the sun proceeds towards the south is considered to be the bestower of good results in this mate 

rial world. 

[^83]:

    The twelve superintending deities, one for each month, are called rudras and named Dakṣa, Canda, Hara, Caṇdī, Pramatha, Bhima, Manmatha, Sakuni, Sumati, Nanda, Gopālaka, and Pitāmahā. 

[^84]:

    If the movement of the vital breath covers one digit, only representing a season (two months), then the sun's movement occupies only the span of three digits. As a result, the span of one year will be six digits and in one single movement of the outgoing and ingoing vital breaths twelve years can be conceived. 

234 NOTES 



[^85]:

    The normal period of the year with reference to human beings and the supposed year of the vital breath are different. 

[^86]:

    The span of a divine year is said to to consist of 12,000 human years. This period is divided into four divisions known as: ksta, consisting 4,000 years; tretā, consisting of 3,000 years; dvāpara, consisting of 2,000 years, and kali, whose duration is 1,000 years. Thus, the total comes to 10,000 years, while the remaining 2,000 years are considered to be junctions. The span of these junctions is 400, 300, 200, 100 years and counted in the following way: the last 100 years of the kali are added to the first 400 years of the krta; thus the span of the first junction is 500 years. Similarly, the duration of the junc - ture of the krta and tretā is 400 years plus 300, and thus 700 years; next, the duration of the juncture of the trētā and dvāpara is 300 years plus 200 and thus 500 years; finally, the juncture of dvāpara and kali is 200 years plus 100, yielding 300 years. Therefore, the accumulated duration of all the junctions is 2000 years. 

[^87]:

    Different Indras are said to be the rulers in different cycles of Manu. 

During the period in which Brahmā remains active, fourteen cycles of Manu pass on. This long period is said to be a span of one day of 

Brahmā's life. His night is of the same span. 

[^88]:

    The term "three worlds” refers to the nether world along with the 

bhuḥ, bhuvaḥ, and svaḥ. 

[^89]:

    The night in avyakta is said to be a kind of dissolution. However, 

this is a subsidiary dissolution (pralaya) and not a principal one 

(mahāpralaya). 

[^90]:

    According to the teachings of agamas, those who have attained lib 

eration following the doctrine of Sāmkhya and other systems are certain to be created again at the start of new creation. This is because their liberation is of limited nature and does not elevate 

them above maya. For details see Chapter Eight. 

[^91]:

    The sheaths (kañcukas) are five or six. They are niyati, kalā, rāga, 

vidyā, kalā, and māyā. Māyā is the all-pervading principle. The day of kalā is the duration of 100 years of those who live in the principle niyati. In the same way, 100 years of kalā is the span of a day of those who live in the principle rāga. One hundred years of

. 

principle called rāga are only one day of the principle of vidyā. In the same way the day of the principle kalā comprises 100 years of the principle vidyā. Similarly, one day of māyā is made of 100 

years of the principle kalā. 

[^92]:

    The night related to the principle of Sadāśiva is considered to be the 

great dissolution (mahāpralaya). During this period all the paths (adhvas) remain dissolved in the state of equilibrium. The super intending deity known as Sadāśiva is dissolved in the primal sound (nāda). This primal sound is in turn dissolved into śakti, śakti into vyāpini and vyāpinī into samanā. In samanā there is no trace of time. It is the eyerlasting state. It is from this state that time arises like the opening and closing of the eyelids. Though all the limited souls rest in this supreme state of equilibrium, they do not attain 

final liberation. 

[^93]:

    The creations and dissolutions are highly extensive and varied and 

abide in the vital energy. The vital energy is essentially of the nature of vibrative energy (spanda). This energy, from which time and its divisions emerge, is ever-pulsating. Time is not at all abso lute but relative, and it has its base in the will of the Lord. On account of the vibration of consciousness, the minute moment 

becomes varied and it is experienced as highly extensive. 

[^94]:

    There are two 'ends of twelve' (dvādaśānta). One is above brah 

mārandhra and the other is in mūlādhāra. The first is known as śivadvādaśānta, the end of twelve related to śiva, and the other is 

known as the end of twelve related to śakti. 

[^95]:

    The six causal deities (kāraṇaṣaṭka) each have six centers. They 

abide in those centers in the ascending and descending order. The superintending deities of the respective centers function in differ 

ent stages of life and finally bestow release (mokṣa). 

[^96]:

    The ten principal channels that prāṇa circulates through are idā, 

pingalā, suṣumnā, gāndhari, hastiyjihvā, pūṣā, yaśā, alamhbusā, kuhū, and sankhini. Although all the channels have emerged from 

the navel, they become manifest in the heart. 

[^97]:

    The superintending deities of directions are ten. They are Indra, 

Vahni, Yama, and so on. They rotate in a cyclic order and as a 

236 NOTES 

result, limited souls act in accordance with the nature of these dei ties. Sometimes they are morbid, sometimes they are haughty, sad, 

elated, happy, unhappy, etc. 

[^98]:

    The names of three principal channels are idā, pingalā, and sus 

umnā. They are supposed to be located inside the spinal cord. Idā is placed at the left, pingalā to the right, and suṣumna in the mid dle of the spinal cord. Ida represents the moon, pingalā the sun, and suṣumnā the fire. While the vital air samāna moves along these three principal channels up and down, they assume the 

nature of the sun, the moon, and fire. 

[^99]:

    All the Sanskrit syllables are divided into eight groups (varga). All 

the vowels come under "a" group (varga). The number of vowels is sixteen. Then come the group of "ka," "ca,"" "ta," "ta," "pa,” 

"sa," and the group of semi-vowels. 

[^100]:

    The number of half mātrās regarding "ka" and so on is thirty-three. 

Half mātrās of long vowels are thirty-two. Phonemes known as pluta have six half mātrās. Therefore, the total of half mātrās is

[^101]:

    According to this system, the Lord's power of action (kriyāśakti) 

manifests time and space as 'paths' (adhvas). The path of space is a means of unifying and traversing insubstantial and substantial forms such as the intellect, the altar or image, the void. Despite this diversity, all these forms abide in consciousness and have their 

place of repose (viśrānti) in consciousness. 

[^102]:

    On the path, all forms shine internally and externally through the 

outlets of consciousness; this is how they are created and mani fested. Consciousness, in its autonomy, shines as both the knowing subject and its object. The variety of objects, though not different 

from the knowing subject, appears as if different from it. 

[^103]:

    The aspirant attains the nature of Bhairava by perceiving everything, 

from the all-consuming fire (kālāgni) said to abide at the bottom of the earth, to the highest principle, i.e., anāśritaśiva, in ascending order and unifying them into the singularity of I-Consciousness. 

NOTES 237 



[^104]:

    Worlds of a variegated nature are included under the principle of 

earth. The sphere under which they shine is called the sphere of Brahmā. Similarly, other spheres, e.g., the sphere of praksti, the sphere of māyā, and the sphere of śakti, are wider than the preced ing one. All the principles from water to prakrti come under the sphere of prakrti. All the principles from puruṣa to māyā come under the sphere of māyā. The extent of the sphere of śakti extends up to the Sadāśiva principle. Thus, the number of spheres (andas) is four. The spheres are the masses of substance which have fallen 

from the state of energy. 

[^105]:

    According to this system, there are ten 'guardians of the quarters' 

in accordance with the number of directions. The guardians of each direction are composed of a group of ten, consisting of a superintending deity and nine subordinates. Taken as ten groups of ten guardians, the total number becomes 100 deities; therefore, 

they are known as the “Hundred Rudras" (Satarudras). 

[^106]:

    This system envisions a limitless number of 'worlds' made from 

and dominated by each principle. These worlds exist so that souls which have not received the Saiva form of initiation, but have attained a lower form of perfection through a continuous practice of concentration, receive a body and sense organs best suited for experiencing pleasure and pain in a particular world, and may finally attain identity with the Lord. Every world has superintend 

ing deities who are called the Lords of that world. 

[^107]:

    Located in the intellect principle (buddhi tattva) are eight 'worlds' 

(bhuvana), each dominated by a class of heavenly beings or deity: pisacas, raksasas, yakśas, gandharvas, Indra, Soma, Prajāpati, 

and Brahmā. 

[^108]:

    According to the Svacchanda Tantra, the names of the worlds 

under prakrti are: Akrta, Krta, Vaibhava, Brahma, Vaiṣnava, Kaumara, 'belonging to Uma' (Auma), and 'belonging to Srikant ha.' Kṣemarāja explains that those who have practiced yoga with renunciation attain the 'world' (bhuvana) named Akrta, while those who practiced karmayoga reach the bhuvana named Krta. Similarly, those who practiced nirmanayoga go to the world of 

238 NOTES 

sbhus. The abode of Brahmā is attainable to those who practice yoga with conviction that puruṣa is one universal soul. The abode of Viṣnu is the final resort for those who strictly practiced yoga according to Vaiṣṇava tradition. Those who practice yoga main taining celibacy (brahmacarya) go to the abode of Kaumara world. The abodes above this, named Auma and Sraikantha, are the 

abodes of those who practice yoga according to the Saiva doctrine. 

[^109]:

    There are seven groups of eight deities who preside over different 

principles. The first is called patysttaka, the group of eight Lords beginning with Lakulisa and ending with Amaresa. The second is called Guhyaṣtaka who are the Lords of fire; the first of them is Bhairava. The third group is Atiguhyașttaka, which rules over the principle named wind (vayu). The fourth group of eight is called Pavitrāstaka, with Sthānu, etc., who rule over the principle called ākāśa. The fifth group of eight, beginning with Sthūla and ending with Chagalāṇda, rules over ahamkāra. The sixth group of eight divinities called Yonyaṣtaka rules over the intellect. The seventh 

group of eight is called Yogaṣtaka which rules over prakrti. 

[^110]:

    The eleven worlds of the Rudras are as follows: Vāma, Bhīma, 

Ugra, Bhava, Isa, Ekavīra, Pracanda, Gauri, Aja, Ananta, and 

Ekaśiva. 

[^111]:

    The names of the worlds in impure vidyā, kale, and niyati are Kro 

dheśa and Canda, Samvarta and Jyoti, Sūra and Pancānta, respec 

tively. 

[^112]:

    The worlds under kalā and mayā are as follows: Ekavīra, śikhi, 

Śrīkantha in kalā, while in māyā, Mahātejas, Vāma, Bhava, Udb 

hava, Ekapinga and īsāna, Bhuvanesa and Anguṣtha. 

[^113]:

    In pure vidyā principle there are five worlds. They are: Hala 

halarudra, Krodha, Ambika, Aghora, and Yama. 

[^114]:

    Every principle is composed of subtle elements (kalās). They are 

called nirrtti, pratisthā, vidyā, śāntā, and sāntātītā. The number of worlds in niyrttikalā is sixteen; in pratistha the number is fifty six; in vidyā the number is twenty-eight; in śāntā the number is eighteen. There are no worlds in śāntātītā. Thus, the total number of the worlds in all five kalās is one hundred eighteen. 

NOTES 239 

Chapter Eight 

[^115]:

    The generic attribute of all jars is jarness, i.e., that which perme 

ates all jars. The highest Lord, śiva, is far more extensive than any other generic attribute; therefore, he is the greatest universal by 

whose light everything shines. 

[^116]:

    According to this system, where some specific characteristics such 

as, support, solidity, etc., are found, that is to be known as the earth principle. These characteristics of the earth are seen in the regions beginning with the all-consuming dreadful fire (kālāgni) 

and ending in the world of Virabhadra. 

[^117]:

    The theory of the nature of absolute causal relation states that even 

at the emergence of creation, the universe is nothing but an expan sion, an 'opening up' (sr̥ṣṭi) of the light of the autonomous Lord. The Lord is also the cause of 'maintenance' (sthiti), i.e., the uni verse remaining steadily present within the Self; and 'withdrawal (saṁhāra), the state of rest in one's own Self. According to this theory, in reality no change has taken place in the Self, which is identical with consciousness. Furthermore, internality and exter nality are not distinct from each other, but two sides of the same reality. The artificial or fictional causal relation is not real, and is accepted only to help explain the state existing in māyā. The power of causal relation is limited and governed by the Lord's restrictive 

power (niyati). 

[^118]:

    For the creation of a particular object, some elements are present 

in the beginning and others follow it in a regular order. This order of sequence, in the form of priority and posteriority, remains invariably present; for example, the clay used in making a jar is 

always present before the jar itself comes into existence. 

[^119]:

    Every effect has in its background the sentient cause as its agent. If 

the conscious agent is absent, the aggregation of all the causes, either individually or collectively, cannot produce the intended object. For example, even if the stick for moving the potter's wheel, clay, and other necessary materials for making a jar are present, the jar cannot be produced if the potter himself is absent. There fore, it is concluded that a conscious agent is required for produc240 NOTES 

ing an effect. However, all of the above-mentioned instruments, along with the sentient agent, are considered as the cause of any 

action which in reality terminates in consciousness. 

[^120]:

    It is generally accepted that the causal relation depends on or is 

controlled by the restrictive power of the Lord. Therefore, it is relative, but the absolute causal relation depends on none. Con sciousness shines in the form of the universe. For instance, all the principles (tattvas) from earth to śiva are dependent on the one prior to it. The earth is supported by the water, the water helps the earth for its solidity. Furthermore, all the elements are unable to come into being without the existence of subtle elements. In the same way, these subtle elements cannot come into existence with out the blossoming action of the sense organs. That again is impos sible without determination regarding different sense organs. This also is not possible without the existence of the primary matter inseparably and equally linked with all, which is known as mūlapraksti. This primary matter, being an enjoyable object, is unable to exist without the subject that enjoys it. The subject that experiences it is the sharer of the experience of different objects of experience. It is for that reason that it is considered limited. Thus, the limitation that is seen in a conscious subject (puruṣa) is only imposed and not real. This imposed limitation is due to kāla, kalā, niyati, rāga, and vidyā, which cannot be activated without con sciousness (samvit). However, consciousness, being partless, can not manifest without the existence of the delusive power called māyā. Freedom, the cause of limitation, has comparative distinc tions of manifestation. These features are shining in the beginning as slightly unlimited, then unlimited, then slightly blossoming and finally are fully bloomed. However, these states of the manifesta tions by the power of freedom could not be possible without that which is perfectly luminous by nature, which in this system is 

called Bhairava. 

[^121]:

    This remark explains the existence of differentiation or multiplicity 

in spite of the presence of the Absolute everywhere. 

[^122]:

    Mount Meru cannot be supposed to be the cause of the jar, because 

NOTES 241 

it exists in a distant place. The question implied here is, how could 

the universe be created by a Lord who remains distant? 

[^123]:

    This is to say that the effects can be produced in a variety of ways. 

[^124]:

    śiva is, in essence, consciousness. He is perfectly full and free 

from desire. In the state of māyā, the limited soul feels a longing for an object in order to fulfill his desires. The desire arises in the limited soul because of some want in him. The Lord, on the other hand, does not lack anything. Therefore, there is no question of any desire in him. However, on account of his freedom, a sort of intention toward tasting of his delight continuously goes on. The pentad-named śiva, śakti, sadāśiva, īśvara, and śuddhavidyā, who abide in the pure path (adhva), shine with comparative intensity from the relish of the taste of delight on account of his autonomy. It is because of the comparative intensity of this relish that con sciousness manifests itself as "I" (aham). This is known as the state of śakti. In other words, consciousness which is absolute (anuttara) now sees (as if), on the mirror of consciousness, its own reflection and cognizes it to be its own, then the cognition that fol lows is “I am This” (aham idam). In this instance, the substratum where it shines is “I” and “This" shines as an indistinct outline of the picture. In the cognition, "I am This," "I” is the principal and "This" has the subordinate position. The principle known as sadāśiva abides where the host of the subjects called mantreśvara cognizes the universal light of consciousness as “I am This.” But on the level of the knowing subjects called mantreśvara, this cog nition assumes the form of “This is I," where "This” is vividly prominent and “I” is subordinate. This principle is called isvara, where “This” as the knowable shines with “I," invariably one with it. In śuddhavidyā, on the other hand, there is no distinction between principality and subordinacy. There both “I” and “This" 

shine in a balanced way. 

[^125]:

    In this triadic system, subjects are of seven kinds. They are known 

as sakala, pralayākala, vijñānākala, mantra, mantreśvara, mantramaheśvara, and śiva. Impurities are of three kinds. They are ānava, māyīya, and kārma. The āṇavamala is of two kinds. 

242 NOTES 

First, it lacks right knowledge regarding the Self, which is of the nature of consciousness. The second is the wrong notion of con ceiving non-self, that is, the body, the sense organs, prāṇa, etc., as the Self. The impurity born of māyā (māyīya) causes the notion of difference. The impurity born of deeds (karma) appears to the soul to be of the nature of virtue and vice. Impurities are considered to be the bond by which souls remain bound to worldly existence. The knowing subjects who have all of the above three defilements (mala) are called sakala. The souls known as pralayākala have two such impurities, i.e., āṇava and karma. The vijñānākala souls have only one mala. They are of two kinds: (a) free vijñānākala souls, in which all·impurities have ended, and (b) vijñānākala souls, in: which some trace of impurity still persists. From among the first group, eight vidyeśvaras are selected, and from the second group 

seven million mantras serve the Lord to help the worldly people. 

[^126]:

    śiva is always perfectly full of His five powers. However, he mani 

fests different principles in which a particular energy shines pre dominantly while other energies remain subordinate. On account of this factor different principles, even in this pure path, and dis 

tinct features like śiva, Sadāśiva, etc., become manifest. 

[^127]:

    According to this system, defilement (mala) is not a distinct sub 

stance as accepted by dualist Saiva thinkers. 

[^128]:

    It is comparable to a seed, which does not take root and blossom 

externally and is going to be destroyed. 

[^129]:

    The characteristic of kalā is limited doership. 

[^130]:

    In some doctrines kāla evolves after niyati, but in the present text 

niyati is mentioned after kāla. The reason for this is that the causal relation cannot stand without time, for the regular order of the cause preceding the effect cannot take place without time. Priority 

and posteriority can exist only when time comes into being. 

[^131]:

    Kalā is the agent which creates the knowable object and the effect 

as separate from itself. 

[^132]:

    Sukha is the state of agitation which is pleasant, rajas is the state 

of agitation which is painful, while tamas is the state of agitation which lacks awareness. 

NOTES 243 



[^133]:

    Above intellect (buddhi) and below the primordial matter (prakrti), 

a guna principle (tattva) is supposed to exist. It is only an aspect of praksti, the balanced state of three guṇas. Therefore, the balanced state of guṇas is called prakrti and its agitated aspect is known as guṇa tattva. However, guṇa is not counted as a distinct principle from praksti. The impelling force that agitates or breaks the bal ance of prakrti is the superintending deity of the tattva. The agita tion in praksti occurs in relation to those who desire enjoyment, but in those in whom these desires of enjoyment have disappeared, this agitation does not create any effect. According to the Trika 

system, agitation in praksti is caused by the.Lord Srikanthaṇātha. 

[^134]:

    According to Sāṁkhya philosophy, prakrtį is insentient, while 

purusa is sentient but non-active either in bondage or in liberation. Therefore, some external agent of agitation is required. According to Saiva philosophy, agitation is created by the intervention of 

īśvara. 



[^135]:

    As, for example, when one perceives an object, the cognition “I 

see a tree" arises. In this instance, “I” is a subject and a tree is an object. The relationship between the two, the experiencing subject and object is the result of ahamkāra. For seeing a tree, eyes are sufficient, but the sight of the tree is experienced by the instru 

ment "I" ahamkāra. 

[^136]:

    When, by spiritual practice, the mind becomes subtle, it does not 

require any external instrument for perception. At that point, it can see through the sense of touch and experience touch through 

the sense of hearing, etc. 

[^137]:

    This is a reference to the Vaiseșika school of thought, according to 

which sense organs are born of matter. 

Chapter Nine 

[^138]:

    Here thirty-six principles (tattvas) are understood in terms of 

seven kinds of knowing subjects (pramātā) residing on the seven 

spheres along thirty-six principles. 

[^139]:

    The plural ending attached to the names of these seven knowing 

subjects indicates the existence of a great number of knowing sub jects belonging to each of these groups. 

244 NOTES 



[^140]:

    In the lowest sphere, from earth to praksti, reside the sakala know 

ing subjects. The sakala knowing subjects are capable of perceiv ing only the principles from earth to praksti. The higher knowing subjects, who possess more extensive subjectivity and therefore possess qualitatively different energies (śaktis), are capable of per 

ceiving the higher principles. 

[^141]:

    In TĀ 10:3-5, Abhinavagupta explains: 

The principles from earth to praksti are divided into fifteen on the basis of the (seven) possessors of power (śaktimān), their powers (śaktis), along with their 'unique nature' or thing in itself', (svarūpa). There are thir-: teen divisions from puruṣa to kalā; eleven divisions [exist] when the pralayakala [group of knowing sub jects) becomes the thing in itself, it is similar with māyā; [there are] nine divisions when the thing in itself becomes vijnanakala; seven divisions [manifest] when the man tra [knowing subjects) becomes the unique nature; a threefold division [arises) when the mantramahesvaras become the unique nature. Śiva, whose nature is con sciousness, which is dance of uninterrupted light, has no 

division. 

[^142]:

    The expression prameyatayogya means: 'that which is worthy to 

be conceived as an object itself,' that is, as insentient; it is neither 

energy nor the possessor of energy. 

[^143]:

    According to this system, the universe is of a threefold nature, 

non-transcendent (apara), transcendent-non-transcendent (parā para), and transcendent (para). In other words, reality is primarily conceived as possessing an objective side (nara), energy (śakti), and a possessor of the energy (śaktimān). However, Abhi navagupta points out that the thing in itself' (svarūpa) is the sphere of objectivity, the śākta is the sphere of perception, and the possessor of power is the perceiver or knowing subject. Therefore, all seven knowing subjects are śiva, who possesses different ener gies, that is, different powers in the different spheres in which they operate. The thing in itself is common to all of them, which pro vides a degree of objectivity. 

NOTES 245 



[^144]:

    Limited knowledge (vidyā) and limited agency (kalā) are consid 

ered to be the energies of the sakala souls, who are defiled by all three impurities (malas). Although sakala souls are bound and limited by impurities, they possess the powers of knowledge and 

action. 

[^145]:

    The word asphuṭa means indistinct or dormant. In pralayākala 

souls, vidyā and kalā are still present; however, they remain dor 

mant because they rest in deep sleep (suṣupti). 

[^146]:

    The sevenfold differentiation of the śaktis is used for the purpose 

of elaboration and instruction. In reality, there is only one śakti ... belonging to the Lord; that is, His svātantryaśakti, which is .inseparably united with Him. This autonomy manifests itself as 

many śaktis, but at the same time keeps all of them within and 

shines as one. 

[^147]:

    Distinctions among the instruments do not create distinction in the 

subject. The supreme subject, by means of its power of freedom, creates divisions in its own Self by causing some to shine as an 

object, and others as an instrument. 

[^148]:

    Here begins a long and complex argument in which Abhinavagupta 

attempts to refute 'doctrine of perceptibility' advocated by the Mīmāṁsā school. According to the Mīmāṁsā theory, in order to be perceived, every object must possess a quality of perceptibility; any object devoid of this quality cannot be perceived. Abhi navagupta disagrees and attempts to prove that perceptibility is not the quality of an object, but a power possessed by the perceiver. All entities already exist within consciousness, and when a given entity appears within the organs of perception of a perceiver, then it becomes an object of perception. Everything is illuminated by consciousness, including defilement (mala), as well as non-exis tence, because for a thing to be non-existent, it must be included in consciousness. Therefore, objective existence depends on con sciousness, and is not perceptible independently from it. For Abhi navagupta, it is important to establish this position, because he needs to argue that the knowing subject must develop a higher level of subjectivity to be able to perceive the larger and subtler spheres of reality.

    The one who is self-luminous does not need anyone to perceive this 

shining, because it is the very nature of the divine to shine. There fore, He does not assume the nature of objectivity, and because of that the quality of being perceptible, which is distinct from its own 

Self, does not appear in Him. 

[^150]:

    The point here is that this feeling of jealousy does not abide in the 

beautiful woman, but in the person himself. 

[^151]:

    The act of watching this dance becomes complete when a person 

attains the state of aesthetic pleasure by becoming one with the unified light of awareness manifested through the watching audi ence; thus, vidya and kala awaken subjectivity in sakala souls where objectivity is predominant. 

. 

[^152]:

    The point here is that when objectivity in the principles from puruṣa 

to kalā are conceived and the portions of the veils (kañcukas) come into perception in the form of objects, then the subjectivity of 

puruṣa is lost. 

[^153]:

    The distinctions have been ascertained, but the number of objects 

which possess multiple natures cannot be stated. Therefore, the author, taking a clay jar as an example, presents its varied nature. Its quality of being a knowable object is nothing but its identity with the knowing subject. Therefore, when the jar is known by all knowing subjects as a jar, then it comes under the sakala group. When, on the other hand, it is only perceived by śiva, it is none 

other than śiva Himself. 

[^154]:

    The seeker who apprehends the earth principle as Brahman, but 

who dies before becoming fully established in śiva, attains the 

state of vijñānākala. 

[^155]:

    Those who practice the yoga of conceiving the earth principle as 

Brahman, by the end of the day of Brahmā (kalpa), or at the time 

of death, attain the state of pralayakevala. 

[^156]:

    When the group of seven knowing subjects, from sakala to śiva, is 

agitated (prakṣobha), they become intent on functioning in their respective fields. This agitation is known as a 'pulsation' or a 'change.' This brings about the appearance of the seven śaktis; there fore, the number of possessors of the śaktis (śaktimān) is also seven. 

NOTES 247 



[^157]:

    The purity of pure knowable (śuddhaprameya) is a result of it not 

being touched by the knowing subject. This is the case with the earth principle as well as the thing in itself (svarūpas) of all the 

other principles as well. 

[^158]:

    When a person well-established in prāṇa perceives an external 

object, his breath goes outside to a span of sixteen digits (angulas). When the final measure comes in contact with an object, the breath becomes identified with it. This is explained by the term 

tanmayi. 

[^159]:

    Those who are endowed with discerning capability are able to con 

ceive fifteenfold nature to the end of pradhana. 

[^160]:

    With the lessening of-the-number of thought constructs, the span of 

a tuti also lessens. The lessening of the thought of this-ness (idantā) diminishes gradually, and it finally results in the form of 

absorption into śiva constituting two digits (angulas). 

[^161]:

    The word sāvadhānatā here means 'steadiness of consciousness of 

that is not to be diverted from here to there, or from this to that.' It means that the yogin remains attentive towards that one from which the knower of the object (grāhaka) arises, and from where the object gets its rise. It always remains steady in self-luminous 

consciousness alone. 

[^162]:

    According to early Saiva thinkers, such as Kallata, the meaning of 

the word pāta is goddess Kālī, Mātssadbhāva, Bhairava, Pratibhā. However, the author himself is reluctant to go into depth explain 

ing the mystical meaning of this word. 

[^163]:

    When a yogin practices meditation in the tuṭi related either to 

mantramaheśvara, mantreśvara, or mantra, he is able to attain 

the siddhis corresponding to these states. 

[^164]:

    The dream state is considered to be an instrument, or rather, a 

door, by the help of which one is able to arrive at the right form of 

knowledge. 

[^165]:

    The supreme consciousness externally assumes threefold nature. 

These are the object of knowledge (rūpam), the instrumentality indicated in the sentence above by the expression "by, means of sight," while the word aham indicates the subject of experience. 

248 NOTES 

Therefore, the subject knows the object by means of the instru ment, i.e., sight. However, the supreme subject (parā) permeates and remains above these three. 

Chapter Ten 

[^166]:

    According to this system, there exists a subtle energy which func 

tions to hold all the principles (tattvas) in their respective places For example, the principle earth is held by the subtle energy called dhārikā. As the function of this energy is to contain or stop the earth, it is also called nivstti. Similarly, the subtle energies called pratiṣthā, vidyā, and śānta are active in other principles or in 

groups of them. .: 

[^167]:

    Anda sphere, or egg, is that which serves as the wall separating 

one sphere from the other. They are also called coverings or veils 

(āvaraṇa) which do not allow one sphere to penetrate another. 

[^168]:

    This is to say that the qualities, such as smell, taste, touch, etc., 

belonging to earth and other tattvas exist also in the śakti tattva; however, their existence is not in the gross form but in the subtle. This is the reason why śiva is ritually worshipped in the phallic 

form made of five different elements. 

[^169]:

    The principle called śiva is free from any sorts of mutations, limi 

tations, or thought constructs. 

[^170]:

    This is to say that transcendence cannot be an object of meditation. 

If an object of meditation were to exist in it, it would not be tran scendent. Therefore, the kala that functions in the lower level, just below the highest, is known as śāntā. However, śiva is beyond 

śāntā; therefore, no name is suitable to describe the Immutable One. 

[^171]:

    Anything that shines as knowable remains existing for some time, 

but when the quality of being an object of knowledge disappears from the heart of the yogin, that which remains is known as thirty six principles. Even if, for the purpose of teaching, in that state, the divine is conceived as the thirty-seventh principle, then upon the disappearance of even this objectivity from it, the divine is conceived as the thirty-eighth principle.

NOTES 249 



[^172]:

    When the whole scheme of thirty-six tattvas is grouped into nine 

divisions, then their names are praksti, puruṣa, niyati, kāla, māyā, 

vidyā, īśvara, sadāśiva, and śiva. 

[^173]:

    The worlds are perceived as objects of knowledge shining in three 

different forms of knowable objects. They are: kalā, tattva, and bhuvana. In the same way, when they rest in the subject, they are also threefold, i.e., varṇa, mantra, and pada. 

Chapter Eleven 

[^174]:

    Abhinavagupta's thesis is, in essence, that consciousness (samvid) . is a perfect unity, full and unchanging even when taking the forms 

of all manifestations and activities. What is contained in the first ten chapters of this work constitutes a short-cut for a small number of truth-seekers who, according to this system, have been pursuing spiritual perfection over many lifetimes. The significance of this 

knowledge for others is made clear in this chapter. 

[^175]:

    It is stated in the Bhagavadgita that the fire of knowledge burns 

the karma of all deeds. For one undergoing the experience of past deeds, it is necessary to remain involved in actions whose fruits are to be experienced in the future. The doer has to experience the results of past actions gradually, not all at once. There is no end to the cycle of deeds or their results, and for this reason the descent of grace (śaktipāta) needs to be discussed. According to the posi tion represented here, when śakti 'opens up in one's own self, 

right knowledge dawns spontaneously. 

[^176]:

    Karmasāmya occurs as a result of balance of two mutually oppo 

site past actions. Both of these actions possess exactly equal power, and therefore restrict each other from producing any fruit. Accord ing to this theory, śaktipāta takes place when these two deeds are 

balanced and their results neutralized. 

[^177]:

    According to the teacher Khetapāla, that śakti whose nature is to 

restrain (nirodhikā) arrests the mala. When impurities (mala) become perfectly ripened, the above śakti becomes inactive, and the proper manifestation of knowledge and action occurs. This cul minates in the decent of grace (śaktipāta) on a seeker.250 NOTES 



[^178]:

    When the Lord assumes the form of bound being by accepting the 

limitations of time, space, etc., this does not entail any differentia 

tion in His innermost nature. 

[^179]:

    The term jhatiti means 'without delay,' that is, taking recourse 

directly to anupāya. 

[^180]:

    The term 'by gradual process' (kramena) refers to a method of ini 

tiation, performance rituals, etc. 

[^181]:

    This is the Saiva explanation of the nature of the descent of grace. 

In the process of manifestation, the supreme Lord (Parameśvara) creates limited beings by concealing (tirobhāva) His own Self through kancukas, tattvas, and the malas. He reveals his own Self by bestowing śaktipāta on-limited souls. The entire process of con cealment and revelation is the result of the autonomy (svātantrya) 

of the Lord. 

[^182]:

    This is to say that the autonomous and omnipresent Lord is impar 

tial and therefore there is no object, activity, or person that He 

prefers over others. 

[^183]:

    As it is stated, the right kind of teacher (guru) is considered to be 

equal to Bhairava. This is because he possesses the fullness of self realization as well as the right understanding of the meaning of the 

śāstras. 

[^184]:

    Although śakti is present everywhere, it has different forms with 

different effects: as jyeșthā-śakti, it leads one to the ultimate goal; on the other hand, the ghorā and ghoratarā-śaktis, that is, the fearsome and the terrible, lead one toward worldly existence. 

Chapter Twelve 

[^185]:

    Viras are Saiva practitioners deemed to have attained mastery over 

the senses and a high level of spiritual development. 

[^186]:

    The procedure of external bathing is as follows: keeping the mind 

steadily concentrated on the mantra given to him by the guru, one should follow the track of the cows while dust is still present in the air. One is supposed to enter, and should make three strides in the dust created by the cows. This is known as pārthiva bath. In the 

NOTES 251 

same way, one should purify the whole body, beginning with head and ending with feet, by uttering the mantra of śiva with its five limbs (Isana is the head, Tatpurusa is the face, Aghora is the heart, Vāmadeva is the hidden parts of the body, and Sadyojāta is the whole body). Then, having cleansed the body with the mantra, one should plunge into the water repeating the mantra of śiva with its auxiliary parts. This is known as bathing with water. Taking ashes from the sacrificial fire, one should burn impurities present on the head, face, heart, genitals, and the feet with it while uttering the mantra "phat.” When this is done one should throw a handful of these ashes on the head while repeating the mantra of śiva with its five limbs. This is known as bathing with ashes. One should move back and forth in the pleasing air, remembering the mantra, given to him by his guru, in his heart. This is known as bathing with air. One should bring the mantra into one's mind and should remain concentrated there fixing his concentration on the void (ākāśa). This is known as bathing in the void. One who immerses oneself in the light of the sun and the moon, identifying himself with śiva, is cleansed of all impurities. This type of bathing is called soma and arka. The last type of bath is bathing in the Self (ātmā). In the Tan traloka, Abhinavagupta describes it in the following way: “The very Self is the supreme Lord himself; it is free from disciplines established in spiritual texts. It is like a great lake in extension and depth; the universe should dissolve therein, upon which one 

becomes pure and the cause of purification for others.” 

[^187]:

    The expression "tatratatra” refers to the five faces of śiva, i.e., 

Īsana, Tatpuruṣa, etc. One is to first identify with these five faces of śiva, upon which one attains full absorption into śiva. 

Chapter Thirteen 

[^188]:

    The author begins this chapter, which deals with initiation, by 

describing the procedure for selecting a suitable place for worship, mantra repetition, and practice of yoga. He discusses this topic in Chapter 15 of his TĀ, verses 80-115ab. At the very beginning, Abhinavagupta points out that only when one is serene and well 

252 NOTES 

disposed in his heart (bhāvam prasannam ālocya) is he suitable to perform worship, and only then should he proceed to the place of 

worship. 

[^189]:

    In TĀ 15: 114a-115b, Abhinavagupta describes the place where 

the worship should take place: "The suitable place--for either attaining perfection or liberation with regard to the practice of worship, mantra repetition, or attainment of samādhi-is the one 

where heart is inclined toward beauty and at peace." 

[^190]:

    The land of Aryans is between Himalaya and Vindhyācala. 

[^191]:

    Kāraka is a term, used by Pāṇini in his Astādhyāyi, which denotes 

various participants in action presented by a sentence. The closest equivalent in other classical and some modern languages is a word 

'case,' such as nominative, genitive, accusative, ablative, etc. 

[^192]:

    Abhinavagupta, who advocates the theory of the supreme nondual 

ity, has to account for ritual action, which consists of factors or participants in action presented by a sentence (kārakas), which because of their perceived distinction could be construed as con tradicting nonduality. This was certainly the opinion of Samkara cārya and other Advaita Vedānta thinkers; Abhinavagupta dis agreed with this understanding and argues that action, distinction, change, etc., are also included within consciousness. To illustrate, we can take the example of the following sentence: I offer water from the sacrificial pot to Lord śiva with a spoon in the place of worship. The factors here are: the agent of acting, the object of the act, its instrument, its point of ablation, and the location of the act of worship. For Samkarācārya, the supreme reality cannot be of the same order as that of objective existence which is transient in nature. The Brahman is the transcendent, immutable, and partless reality, and all subjective and objective phenomena are only appearances possessing no real existence. The Brahman is without attributes and as immutable, it cannot be subject to action. The attribute of changeability is the most important characteristic of objective existence, and therefore ever-changing empirical exis tence must have a ground on which all these changes take place. The same, of course, applies to the ritual action, which, as we have 

NOTES 253 

seen, consists of the factors or the participants in action described by a sentence. For Abhinavagupta, on the other hand, the supreme reality, which consists of prakāśa and vimarśa, even in the process of externalization, remains established in its own Self, 'relishing' (camatkāra) the bliss of 'fullness' (pūrnatā), and 'independence' (svātantrya) of its own essential nature, which is in no way over shadowed by the external manifestation. The lower aspect of cre ation is a contracted form of that supreme consciousness, which, through the activity of māyā śakti, assumes limited forms, thus bringing into existence the notion of duality. Thus, the supreme reality consists as much of differentiation as it does of unity. This differentiation always remains within that I-Consciousness and therefore is never separate from it. Thus, unlike Samkara for whom action is always binding, Abhinavagupta accepts action, 

such as the ritual activity, as potentially liberating. 

[^193]:

    In TĀ 15: 161, Abhinavagupta describes the role and the meaning 

of sacrificial vessel in:Tantric ritual in the following way: "All that which is touched by the drops of the water contained in the sacrifi cial vessel becomes in fact pure. What other kind of purity could there ever be but that of the touch of the rays of the sun of śiva?” Furthermore, “As the Lord said in the Mālinīvijayottara Tantra in the section dealing with the sacrificial vessel, it is necessary to be careful not to conceive anything as not being purified by it. Every thing is purified by it and what is impure becomes pure" (TĀ 15: 162-163ab.) However, the impurity only belongs to the limited knowing subject abiding in māyā and is not the essential nature of things: “Here we speak of impurity from the perspective of bonded souls and of their systems. The essential nature of all things remains in fact always the same, without changing from what it 

was earlier or what is conceived to be” (TĀ 15: 163cd-164ab.) 

[^194]:

    All the various factors which constitute a ritual action attain iden 

tity with śiva through the process of the placement of the syllables 

(nyāsa). 

[^195]:

    This is to say that direction depends on how the forms are arranged 

in space. 

254 NOTES 



[^196]:

    Here begins description of inner worship. In the course of this 

worship, one is expected to bring one's body, mind, void, and 

prāṇa into identity with śiva. See TĀ 15: 295b-

    This is the reference to múlādhāracakra, which, according to TĀ 

15: 297cd, is located four fingers below the navel. 

[^198]:

    Here begins what Abhinavagupta calls 'the external sacrifice' 

because the disciple, after attaining identity with śiva through var ious ritual acts, should project his consciousness externally in the 

vital breath, void, and up to the external plane. 

[^199]:

    There are eight purificatory rites and six deities. Therefore, the 

number becomes forty-eight.

    Abhinavagupta talks at length about the nature of animal sacrifice 

in TĀ 16:28-

[^72]:

    There, by quoting various scriptures, he points out that any type of animal killing, such as for profit, a wedding, or sport, is not allowed except in the course of sacrifice (yāga). According to him, killing consists of separating an animal that still possesses each of the three impurities (malas) from the vital breath. On the other hand, the ritualistic sacrifice of an animal is not killing because, in the course of the ritual, the animal is first separated from three impurities, and thus it is separated from its body. Thus, for Abhinavagupta, ritual sacrifice of an animal is a 

NOTES 255 

form of initiation which joins the animal with the higher principles 

and for the purpose of propitiating God. 

[^207]:

    The nirbīja type of initiation is given to those judged incapable of following the set of rules of post-initiatory conduct (samayapāśa), as for example children, those who are dull, old people, women, those attached to their wealth, the sick, and so on. They attain liberation on account of their devotion to the teacher, deities, and scriptures. On the other hand, the sabīja type of initiation is given to those who have the gift of reason, are capable of tolerating toils and difficulties, and are therefore capable of following the set of rules of pre-initiatory conduct... 

Chapter Fifteen 

[^208]:

    The initiation described in this chapter is given to a dying person. 

Ordinarily, the initiation is not given to all, and one desirous of initiation needs to show his devotion to teacher, deities, or scrip tures. This devotion is, in turn, seen as an indication of the descent of grace (śaktipāta), and śaktipāta is perceived as a definite sign that one is suitable for initiation. The conditions under which the teacher is expected to grant initiation to a dying person are described by Abhinavagupta in the TĀ 19: 4-6: When in a dying person, the fall of even weak power is awakened-whether he is taken by devotion to a teacher and others; whether the fall of grace is through work of friends, relatives, etc., whether he has been indeed regular (samayin) but has not obtained the supreme initiation; whether, already having obtained it, he desires to leave as soon as possible his vital breaths, desirous of going away-the teacher should provide for him the initiation of immediate depar ture, free from impurities. However, the teacher must be careful not to give initiation to a person whose impurities (malas) haven't reach maturation, or to one whose karma hasn't been exhausted (seṣakarmikavigrahe). The commentator explains this compound to mean: one who is not about to die, that is, one whose prārabdhakarma hasn't been fully exhausted. 

[^209]:

    Marma is the place where the feeling of the connectedness with the body remains present. 

256 NOTES 



[^210]:

    According to the Tantrāloka, this is done by means of the nyāsa, using the kṣurika and other mantras. 

[^211]:

    That is, at the time of leaving one's body. 

[^212]:

    Abhinavagupta describes the nature of brahmavidyā initiation and 

the qualifications a teacher needs to have to perform this kind of initiation in the following way: "This initiation, which provides exit from the body, must be performed by a teacher who is experi enced in yoga. How could one who has not practiced various prāṇayama exercises be in a position to affect it" (TĀ19:23cd 24ab). (The brahmavidya) is in a position of producing its effects automatically, such as the purification of the principles, etc. The teacher, thanks to the power of ritual action and mantras, can thus join the disciple with the supreme principle (tattva). Even if a teacher hasn't practiced yoga, he is nevertheless in a position to execute the initiation that provides immediate exit from the body, 

thanks to the power of ritual action, mantras, and meditation. 

[^213]:

    According to Abhinavagupta, both the samayin and purtka are 

entitled to recite brahmavidyā. By this recitation, the dying person 

receives the samaya type of initiation. See TĀ 19:

[^31]:

    

[^214]:

    The meaning of the expression sapratyaya is 'with signs or with 

giving signs,' as, for example, a person's dead body is re-animated 

by the power of mantra and lifts itself, etc. 

[^215]:

    This is the type of initiation which, according to TĀ, gives hope to 

foolish individuals. It is described by Abhinavagupta in TĀ 20:2–7: The teacher, completely intent upon reciting appropriate mantras, must meditate on his right hand in the form of a triangle of fire, completely flaming, resplendent with the phoneme of fire, stirred by a wheel of winds, and must place there any seed and meditate on how it is burning, both in the hand and within his heart. In this way the seed, consumed by the heat of a multitude of "phat" mantras enlivened by the phonemes of fire "ra," loses every seminal quality and is now incapable of germinating. At the same time, by virtue of this same procedure, based on the power of mantras, meditation, and rituals, the three malas (āṇava, māyiya, and kārma) are also 'burned in the sense that they are no longer in a position to furnish 

NOTES 257 

their products. This initiation, which has as its purpose the destruc tion of the seed, was described to me by the venerable śambhunātha in his benevolence. The teacher, out of mercy, can also join the seed to śiva. The initiation is, in fact, full of splendor (sudipta), and is in 

a position to grant liberation also to vegetable life. 

[^216]:

    This particular type of initiation, which reduces or eliminates the 

weight of a disciple, Abhinavagupta connects with the five stages of repose, that is, pragānanda, udbhava, kampa, nidrā, and ghūrṇi described in Chapter Five of Tantrasāra. In TĀ 20: 14-15ab, he clarifies: “The leap (udbhava) is due to relief, caused by an eclips ing of the corporeal influence (dehagraha). The body is essentially constituted by the elements of earth. When the teacher, thanks to: the mantra of lightness, which will be explained later, meditates on the disciple rising into the air, he loses his earthly qualities." 

Chapter Sixteen 


[^217]:

    As we have seen earlier, it is the aspirant's devotion to the teacher, 

deity, or śāstras which would entitle him to receive initiation, as this devotion is perceived as a clear sign of śaktipāta. However, in the case of the deceased or the absent one, this is obviously impos sible. Yet, the teacher would perform such an initiation if he could in some way infer that śaktipāta had descended on such a person. The signs of this type of śaktipāta are, for example: strong feelings that a teacher himself, for some unknown reason, had for a deceased or absent soul, or the strong persistence of the family 

that advocated initiation. 

[^218]:

    Abhinavagupta describes a procedure called 'application of the 

great net' (mahājjāla prayoga) in some detail in TĀ 21: 25-

[^45]:

    However, the intricacies of this procedure remain unknown because the acārya would receive oral instruction from his own teacher. The purpose of this procedure was rescuing departed souls who, for one reason or another, did not received initiation during their lives. A teacher would first catch the desired soul, draw him into the net, then reinstate him into a figure made of kusa grass, which repre sented his body, and then grant him liberation through initiation. 

258 NOTES 

Chapter Seventeen 

[^219]:

    We have already seen that a disciple is joined to a different princi 

ple in the course of initiation. To which principle one is joined will depend on the school of thought whose initiation one receives. However, according to the Trika school, other schools of thought do not possess the knowledge to enable a disciple to attain identity with śiva. Therefore, those who have received initiation into what the followers of Trika consider inferior sects should be first dis joined or drawn away from the principles that they were joined to by the previous initiation, and then initiated again. The process of transcending the inferior doctrines is accomplished gradually through a succession of steps: the descent of grace, the removal of impurities, the desire to find the right teacher, initiation, knowl edge, the abandonment of that which is to be avoided, immersion into that which is to be accepted, giving up the sphere of the enjoy able, and the removal of the limitations created by āṇavamala. For 

details, see Chapter 22 of the Tantrāloka. 

[^220]:

    Abhinavagupta gives the names of the genetic mantras 

(sādhāraṇāḥ mantrāḥ) in TĀ 22: 

[^20]:

    They are seven in number and their names are: prāṇava or mantra aum, mātskā, māyā, vyo mavyāpi, șadakṣara, bahurūpa, and the eye mantra (netra). According to TĀ 22: 15-17a, this is what a teacher says to one who is about to embrace Saivism and receive initiation: "This one was once a follower of other disciplines but is now inspired by your blessing; therefore bestow your grace (śaktipāta) upon him, so that this abandonment of other doctrines does not become a source of doubt for him, which will oblige him to practice rights of atone ment. And having attained identity with you, may he quickly achieve perfection and liberation." 

Chapter Eighteen 

[^221]:

    In T.23:3-4, Abhinavagupta explains that a spiritual guide 

should transmit his own power (svādhikara) to a disciple whom he thinks is at the point of being in possession of well-practiced knowledge. "The one," continues Abhinavagupta, quoting Kami kāgama, "who does not possess this knowledge is not a teacher, 

NOTES 259 

even if he has been anointed and has passed through the various stages, such as samayin, etc.” Furthermore, the only criterion for the selection of a new teacher is knowledge. Abhinavagupta writes, "The teacher who creates a new teacher must therefore select an individual of full and perfect knowledge, without considering any other characteristic, such as place, family, conduct, and body." TA 

23:16b-17a. 

[^222]:

    In TĀ 23:31-32, Abhinavagupta describes the responsibilities of a 

newly consecrated teacher in the immediate period after his initia tion. He writes: "The new teacher, after having obtained consecra tion, must meditate and recite the entire complex of mantras estab lished in the scriptures for a period of six months so that he becomes one with them. Having attained identity with the mantras, and having taken possession of the potency of mantra (mantra virya), he finally becomes able to cut the bonds. Therefore, he 

should spare no effort to attain identity with the mantras."

    In the Tantrāloka; Abhinavagupta explains that Brāhmaṇs, Kṣatri 

yas, Vaisyas, eunuchs, women, Sudras, and any other kinds of per son desirous of initiation should be initiated without being asked their caste. However, the teacher should take this into consider ation at the time when knowledge is imparted to them. Further more, the teacher, who is the basis of knowledge, should set seven sessions. These sessions are: initiation, explanation, compassion, friendliness, contemplation of the śāstras, unification with śiva, and giving away of food, etc. See TĀ 23:20b/23a.

    As for the purpose of this rite, Abhinavagupta writes: “This type 

of initiation affects the purification of the subtle body (puryașt aka). If the puryaṣtaka does not exist, then there is also no heaven 

or hell.” TĀ 24:20-

    The point here is that the entire procedure performed by teacher 

that will be described in the following lines is performed to estab lish firm conviction on the side of the ignorant ones. The entire performance by the teacher, according to Abhinavagupta, is not helpful in any way in attaining liberation. See TĀ 24:15b-16a.260 NOTES 



[^226]:

    Here begins description of śrāddhadiksā, or post-mortem initiation. 

Abhinavagupta discusses it in Chapter 25 of his TĀ based on the authority of the Siddhayogesvarimata Tantra. This rite must be per formed on the third, fourth, and tenth day after death, every month 

in the first year. After that, it should be performed once every year. 

[^227]:

    In TĀ 25: 4-6, Abhinavagupta clarifies: "This done, the teacher 

must take in hand, first of all, the offering (naivedyam), and after having meditated that in this offering abides śakti of the nature of food in the form of potency instrumental in nourishing, he must conceive that the dead person for whose sake this rite is performed is penetrated by it. The bound part in the form of enjoyable of this dead disciple must then be offered by a teacher to the enjoying sub- . ject in identity with him. In this way, the disciple becomes śiva." 

Chapter Twenty 

[^228]:

    This vague statement can only be understood if we read it along 

with its corresponding section of the TĀ, which is Chapter 

[^26]:

    In the beginning of this chapter, Abhinavagupta explains that all the types of initiation presented up to now, including the last sacra ment, have as their goals purification, enjoyment, liberation, or both enjoyment and liberation. Jayaratha, in his commentary, clar ifies that the initiation which has enjoyment (bubhukṣuḥ) as its aim is structured so that it is not in a position to directly grant libera tion without first granting the fruition of the desired enjoyments). On the other hand, the mumukṣuḥ type of initiation, such as that of a spiritual son, etc., grants liberation precisely because it is devoid of the necessity of prior fruition. Furthermore, this type of initia tion can be either the sabīja or the nirbīja type. Only those who received the sabīja type of initiation are expected to follow a cer tain set of rules for the rest of their lives. On the other hand, those deemed incapable of following these rules receive the nirbīja type of initiation, which in itself includes mantras capable of purifying 

the bonds of post-initiatory rules (samayapāśa). 

[^229]:

    Mantras should be received in the course of ritual and should be 

kept secret. The practitioner should attain identity with the potency of the mantra (mantravirya), without which mantras 

NOTES 261 

remain ineffective. Furthermore, mantras should be received directly from a teacher who has himself attained identity with the potency of the mantra, and not from some book. In TĀ26: 20-24ab, Abhinavagupta writes: 

“The fundamental rule is the following: namely, the man tric form is not to be revealed by the teacher to the dis ciple in written form, especially in our system, which is superior to all. The mantras are of the nature of pho nemes, and phonemes are of the nature of reflective con sciousness. They can be transmitted to the disciple only if . it is not separated from the consciousness of the teacher. ... Written mantras àre, on the other hand, stripped of their 

potency and therefore unreal. Because of the conven tional meaning which clouds them, their natural splendor doesn't manifest from books." However, it has been stated in the Siddhayogesvarīmata that those who, in spite of adopting mantras from books, attain identity with its potency, are purified by Bhairava and spontaneously initiated. “Once mantras have been invoked," continues Abhinavagupta, “it is necessary to satisfy them and propitiate them with flowers, liquor, offerings of food and incense, proportionately to the fate, devotion, and capabilities of the worshipper. The śakti, nāda, and other mantras, which are especially fer vent, must be satisfied with liquor, meat, and blood at the beginning, and only afterwards with flowers, incense, 

etc." (TA 26:51b-53a.) 

[^230]:

    The unmanifest or avyaktalinga is one that has been spontaneously 

formed in nature. Among all the types of unmanifest lingas, those not made by human hand are considered to be the most excellent ones. Therefore, these types of lingas are highly recommended for the purpose of ritual worship. However, manifest, or vyakta lingas, can also be used in rituals, Abhinavagupta writes: “The teacher can, if he wishes, install a manifest linga (vyakta) in the form of an image or painting found in a picture or book, made of wood, gold, or crafted by an expert and initiated artist” (TĀ 27:19b-20a). 

262 NOTES 

Lingas can be made of various materials, such as "little stones, gems, pearls, flowers, food, clothes, and perfumed substances. Lingas of stone created by artists, and so also those of metals, with the exception of gold ones, should be avoided" (TĀ 27: 12-13). Abhinavagupta points out that various measures, given in various texts, regarding the size and shape of lingas, and other concerns, are of little importance because: "The linga which grants the desired fruit is in fact only the one that has been illuminated by 

mantra, animated by its noble potency” (TĀ 27: 14b). 

[^231]:

    With the previous section, the instructions for the types of rituals 

that are indispensable observances (nitya) has been completed. In this section, the description of occasional observances (naimittika) begins. Abhinavagupta derives the word 'parva' from two roots:: the first root, pr,' which means 'to fill,' is combined with the suf fix 'van.' The other root is 'parv,' which also means 'to fill'; thus a celebration of a festival day is called 'parvadinam,' because on 

that day consciousness attains fulfillment. 

[^232]:

    According to the Siddhayogesvarimata, the other name for the 

sacrifice of the wheel (cakrayāga) is mūrtiyāga. The cakrayāga or mūrtiyāga is of five types. Abhinavagupta writes: 

The sacrifice of the wheel is of five types, namely: soli tary (kevala), coupled (yāmala), mixed (miśra), cou pling of the wheel (cakrayuk), and mingling of heroes (vīrasaṁkara). The solitary, in this context, is one in which only the teacher take part; the mixed is one in which disciples also take part, along with their wives; the coupled is of two kinds, based on whether the women who participated were wives or hired courtesans; the cou pling of the wheel is so-called because this is the type of sacrifice associated with the wheel, which because of the unification of śaktis grants all desired fruits; finally the sacrifice in which everybody participates is called min 

gling of the heroes. (TĀ 28: 78b-82a.) 

[^233]:

    One is supposed to perform the offering of the sacred thread (pavitraka) to make up for any deficiency and neglect of his responsibility regarding the teacher, scriptures, or for any transgression of the rules (samaya), or for those who failed to celebrate a festival day (parvadinam) or any of the occasional or indispensable observances. 

[^234]:

    Abhinavagupta outlines the procedure applied when a teacher explains the meaning of scriptures to disciples according to Chapter 52 of the Devyāyamala Tantra. 

[^235]:

    Abhinavagupta lists ten types of teachers capable of explaining the 

scriptures: "Each of these ten types of teachers has assumed a human body and possesses a particular mental disposition, but are all identical with śiva, although they are different from each other through knowledge and action. They are all dedicated to the scrip tures, to worship, to the initiation rites, to sexual union, meat, and liquor. There are secondary divisions among these due to possess ing different mental dispositions, such as tranquility (calmness), 

anger, or patience, etc." (TA 28: 391a-

[^393]:

    ) 

[^236]:

    As we have seen, the spiritual teacher is worshipped in most of the 

other sacrifices, but in all of these instances this worship is an accessory part of the sacrifice. On the other hand, this ritual is primarily devoted to satisfying or pleasing the teacher. 

Chapter Twenty-One 

[^237]:

    In this chapter, Abhinavagupta gives a brief outline of his under 

standing of the nature, meaning, and purpose of the āgamas or śāstras. This summary is brief and cryptic, and therefore difficult to comprehend without prior knowledge of the corresponding chap ters of the Tantrāloka, īśvarapratyabhijñāvimarśinī, or īśvara 

pratyabhijñāvivr̥tivimarśinī. 

[^238]:

    The entire universe is the expression of consciousness, which con 

sists of prakāśa or manifestation, and vimarśa, which is the knowledge of prakāśa in its collective and particular aspects. In a narrower sense, this vimarśa is language, which takes the form of 

the various āgamas. 

[^239]:

    In the last three chapters of his TA, Abhinavagupta discusses the 

nature of the śāstras or agamas at length. The title of Chapter 35 is 

264 NOTES 

"The Union of all the Šāstras.' In it, Abhinavagupta presents his vision that brings together the great variety of agamic texts, both Hindu and non-Hindu. In his analysis, he grants all of them the status of being authoritative or being a valid means of gaining knowledge (pramāna). However, he arranges them in a hierarchi 

cal order, placing the Trika sastras at the apex. 

[^240]:

    For Abhinavagupta, there is only one agama from which all the 

others emerge. This broad acceptance of all sastras requires him to attempt a reconciliation of their differences. In order to accom plish this, he points out that all of them bring about the promised fruit. In this way, Sāṁkhya gives to its follower the knowledge to discriminate between purusa and prakrti. Similarly, the follower of Buddhism attains the buddhi tattva, but only the Trika grants full and complete liberation to those who are entitled (adhikari). For Abhinavagupta, an adhikari is one who possesses firm faith in a given agama. Another question that arises here is: if it is true that all agamas emerge from one and the same source, then why is it necessary to perform a ritual of conversion, such as 'reclamation of linga' (lingouddhāra)? Abhinavagupta explains: 

In the body of one single doctrine, as for example, in the Vedas, it happens that its followers, in order to attain to superior degrees or ranks, must submit to special rites of purification. The same thing can be said in regard to our tradition, as for example, in the case of the reclama tion of the linga, etc. In other words, in the way in which one belonging to a lower āśrama cannot enjoy the fruits which come from the upper aśrama, in the same way, a follower of the Pāñcarātras, etc., cannot attain the iden 

tity with Śiva. (TĀ 35:28-

[^29]:

    ) 

[^241]:

    In TĀ 35: 1b-2a, Abhinavagupta defines prasiddhi as a type of 

knowledge that is necessarily based in an omniscient knowing sub ject and is the basis of all human activity.

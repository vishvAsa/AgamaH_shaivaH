Chapter Fifteen When a teacher learns by himself, or through relatives, of a descent of grace on a person who is about to die,[^208] he should give him the immediate ascension type of initiation (samutkramana diksa). Then the teacher, having placed all six paths in the dis ciple and purifying each of the six, one by one, should place the goddess Kālārātrī in the center of the delicate joints of the body (marma).[^209] Then he should gradually pierce the bonds of the deli cate points by her,[^210] and should then lead the consciousness of the disciple and place it into the brahmarandra. Then, following the aforesaid method, he should offer the final oblation for the purpose of unification so that, after it is offered, and after the individual self exits the body, he may become identical with Lord

śiva. However, for the one who is desirous of enjoyment, the sec ond final oblation is offered for the purpose of associating him with the place of enjoyment. At that moment211 his individual self remains dissolved there, and for him nothing remains to be done in this world. 

In addition to this, a teacher may recite the brahmavidyā 212 into the ear of the disciple. Brahmavidyā, being of the nature of the reflective consciousness, causes an immediate self-reflection of enlightenment in the limited consciousness of the awakened, bound soul. The samayins and others are also entitled to recite it.213 If the nirbīja type of initiation with conviction (sapratyaya)214 is given to a dullard on whom the descent of grace has occurred, then the hand of śiva' (śivahasta) type of procedure should also be disclosed to him. This procedure is followed during offering of the hand of śiva (śivahastadāna) to him. 

There is a fiery triangle, dreadful with flames, from which sparks of fire with the syllabic form of "ra" are emerging. It is being blown from outside by waves of wind. This diagram should be meditated upon using the palm of the teacher's right hand. Throwing a seed there, one should conceive that it has the syl lable "ra" above and below, by which a series of 'phat mantras are awakened, which burn its capacity of creativity.215 Thus, the seed of both become seedless by this type of initiation. It becomes capable of destroying its latent seed power, as has been stated, and even immovable objects are capable of receiving an initiation. The disciple should be conceived as being steadily established in the world of air and carried by it, and should also be conceived as being light in weight. Then, he is seen as being lighter when mea 

sured on the scale.216 

If mantra cuts the delicate joints of the body, and if lightness appears and the power of germination of the seed disappears, the great Lord leads one who is engaged in the right path to attain the desired ends immediately.

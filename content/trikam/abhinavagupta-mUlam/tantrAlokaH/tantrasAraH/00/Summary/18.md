In this chapter the method of abhiseka is described. Abhiseka is given both to putraka and acārya types of disciples, provided they have received the sabīja form of initiation. The term sabīja means “with seed," but it really signifies that this form of initiation is given to those who are competent enough to follow certain strict rules of conduct during their lifetime. On the other hand, the nir-bīja form of initiation is given to old and decrepit persons who are less assiduous and therefore unable to follow strict codes of conduct as enjoined by the holy text. 

Abhiseka is restrictive in the sense that not everybody is considered competent enough to receive it. In particular, acāryābhiṣeka is given to those who, after receiving initiation, have attained proficiency in āgamic knowledge; those who have restraint over their body, mind, and speech; those who follow the duties as enjoined by the scripture; those who have become proficient in the unification of the adhvas in their respective order (adhvānusandhāna); those who have gained perfection-in the highest knowledge by listening to it from their teacher; and those who continue mental exertion for retaining it, followed by meditative thought (śruta, cinta, and bhāvanā) terminating in identity with śiva. The author categorically states that even after receiving abhiṣeka, only one who has really attained perfection in the highest knowledge is worthy of bestowing grace to others.

This chapter gives the procedure known as lingoddhāra; it simply means “rescuing a person from a fallen state." It is performed for one who has gone away from the right track by receiving initia tion from persons belonging to other systems, such as Vaisnava, Bauddha, and other lower Saiva schools. However, the teacher will grant this type of initiation only when he becomes convinced that Śaktipāta has definitely occurred in a prospective disciple. 

According to the author, the Trika is the superior system, for all the other śāstras, as preached by Kapila and others, lead the seeker to attain release from prakrti, but they do not help him attain release from māyā. On the other hand, Saivāgamas, as expounded by the Trika, lead everybody to the ultimate immediately.

Chapter Thirteen After the ritual bath, one should proceed toward the place of wor ship in a delightful mood.188 The place of worship is where heart becomes filled with satisfaction and is well suited for the absorp tion into Parameśvara.189 The place of worship does not have any other characteristics. If any other characteristic is mentioned, it is given only because it is instrumental in granting identification with the object of meditation, which is attained because of mental tran quility. Therefore, there is no place similar to a place of worship. ___ The sacred spot (pitha), the mountaintop, etc., taught in the śāstras as places of worship should be known as supporting this description. The energies (śaktis), possessing the state of absorp tion into Parameśvara and in accordance with his restrictive energy (niyati), incarnate themselves at the various sacred places, like the regions inhabited by the Aryans 190 of good moral conduct, and also the regions of barbarians prone to immorality. The moun taintops and other similar places are conducive to concentration because of being isolated (solitary) and free from distraction. 

Then, while standing outside, in front of the temple, the aspi rant should 'place syllables' (nyāsa) in a general way, first in the fingers and then in the limbs of his body. This should be done with. 

TANTRASĀRA 153 

two combinations of mantras: 'hrim,' 'nam,' 'pham,' 'hrim'; and 'hrim,'',' 'ksa,' 'hrim' indicative of śiva and śakti, which are the 

mantras of the malini and mātrka orders. If this placement of man tras' (nyāsa) is done with only one of these two, then it should first be performed with mālini, followed by matrkā. If nyāsa is done for the purpose of attaining mokṣa, then it should be done from the feet all way to the top of the head. However, if enjoyment (bhoga) is the objective, then it should be done in reverse. The goddess mālini is the principal form of śakti which, because of the close union of vowels (bījas) and consonants (yonis), is capable of fulfilling 

• all sorts of desires. Her name is aptly significant. She is adorned .. with a garland of rudraśaktis blossoming in fruits. She is the hum ming bee of sound (nāda), capable of dissolving the ice of worldly existence. She bears both spiritual perfection (siddhi) and libera tion (mokṣa). She is associated with both the śaktis of offering and accepting, for the syllables "ya" and "ra” are identical, according to Panini. Therefore, even the application of the mantra, which has lost its traditional procedure, becomes perfect (comes to its fruition) by the power of placement of mālini. Impure Gāruda and Vaisnava mantras bestow liberation after becoming pure (by its efficacy).

After the placement of syllables (nyāsa) upon the body, the placement is to be done on the sacrificial vessel (arghapātra) for the ritual. In this system, the activities performed in the ritual form of worship involving verbs and grammatical cases (kārakas)191 for the purpose of steady realization of identification with the Lord have been given as an example.192 Here in the sacrificial vessel (arghapātra) 193 all the cases thus become one with the Lord. 

By following the order of ritual activities in this way, all the (grammatical) cases are transformed into the Lord.194 When all these activities are seen, with this insight, even without taking recourse to the principal form of knowledge or yoga, one becomes united with the Lord. 

Thus, placing syllables (nyāsa) on the vessel for rituals and worshipping with flowers, incense, etc., one should sprinkle the flowers, the essence of the ritual, with small drops of water from the vessel to consecrate them. Then in the orb of light, on the ground, or in the void, one should worship the family of attend ing deities, uttering this mantra: “I pay obeisance to the external deities of the main deity" (aum bāhyaparivārāya namaḥ). Then, at the door [of the place of the sacrifice] one should worship with mantra thus: "I pay my obeisance to the host of deities abiding at the door” (aum dvāra devatācakrāya namah). 

If the external place is not a sacred one, then entering at the front diagram (mandala) and the altar, one should worship the external deities of the family and the host of deities abiding at the door, and should perform the placement of the above-mentioned syllables, etc. This should be done inside the place of worship and not outside. Then uttering the mantra 'phat' three times with a flower in his hand, and energizing them with mantra 'phat,' he should throw the flowers in the northeastern direction, and while conceiving all the obstacles (as being) removed, should enter in front of the mandala and should look on all the sides of the temple kindled with rays of the light belonging to the Lord.

खेचरीयं खसंचारस्थितिभ्यां खामृताशनात् ।। A person desiring liberation should sit facing north so that all of his bonds may quickly be burnt by the flame of the fire emanat ing from the Lord Aghora. Regarding the notion of spatial direc tion (dik), it is stated that the Lord's freedom, by which the forms (mūrtis) [of the spatial directions) are made manifest, is the very principle of the spatial direction. The manifestation of conscious ness itself is the center (madhya), because all the different mani festations of directions make their appearance from that center. The direction of above' is the region which is appropriated by the light, but the direction which is not so (i.e., "below') is the "nether' region. The 'east' is that which remains in front of that light. The direction different from it is the 'west' because the 'east' receives the light facing it. The ‘south' is the direction towards which the currents of light ascend. It is called 'south' (daksina) because of its agreeableness. The direction facing it is the 'north' because it is the region to be illuminated. This is the description of the fourfold directions. 

There in the center exists the Lord, his face called Iśānais in the upper region, and below is his nether face. In the four quarters beginning with east, etc., his faces, called Sri Tatpurusa, Aghora, 

TANTRASĀRA 157 

Sadyojāta, and Vāmadeva, are located. In the middle of the above four directions, there are located four other directions. Thus, it is because of greatness of consciousness that the directions are mani fested, which are caused by the forms.195 For this reason, direction is not a separate principle (tattva); just as when one wants to cross over one's own shadow, it (the shadow) always remains in front. In this same way, the Lord always remains in the center. It has been stated that superior to all is the state of being in the center. Thus, as the Lord is the agent causing the division of directions, so also is the sun. It has been stated in different texts that the sun indeed is the Lord's power of knowledge (jñānaśakti). 

The east is that where the manifestation of light first occurs. Where manifestation occurs, it (the east) is definitely there. Although the directions, such as east, etc., are dependent on the self, i.e., are subjective, the region that remains in the front of a person is always) east. Thus, the determination of direction should be accomplished by bringing the self, the sun, and the Lord into one single concept. This is the knowledge regarding direction as thought by Abhinavagupta's teachers. 

This being the case, one should sit facing north, and by aban doning a sense of egoism (ahambhāva), one should burn the egoism of possessing a body in both the gross and subtle bodies. Though the body still exists, it should be looked at as the bodies of others, for the Self is without a body. Then one who is steadily established in the tranquil and unchanging abode has a natural inclination towards creativity. The first vibrative fractional unit of it is indeed the arising of form (mūrti). Conceiving thus, one should install on that form (mūrti) the host of divinities that are worshipped, as it was prescribed before. Principally, the śaktis should be worshipped, for they are the seats of the nine-formed energy belonging to the Lord. This is the view of our teachers. 

There are five states beginning with waking, etc., but the sixth is called anuttara, the 'innate state' (svabhāva dasā), which is to be conceived as uniting all. Therefore, placement (nyāsa) should be sixfold (upon the six cakras). In these different cakras, Brahmā, 

158 TANTRASĀRA 

Viṣṇu, Rudra, īśvara, Sadāśiva, and śakti, the causal deities, are abiding steadily in the host of thirty-six tattvas, separately in each. By the application of nyāsa, one attains the fullness of Lord Bhairava, who transcends the phenomenal principles. In this way, the state of Bhairava becomes manifest. Therefore, in the case of those who have attained the state of identity with Bhairava, the performance of nyāsa, etc., is meaningless. For those who are established in the tranquil state, what could be the utility of creat ing principles, nyāsa, etc.? In reply to this, we say that the tran quil state of the body of Bhairava is so vast that he is the final terminating point in whose own nature the diversity of manifesta tions, dissolution, and creation remains manifest. 

Thus, by means of the mutual union of the two, and by meditat ing on the vital air, body, intellect, etc., which have become trans formed into the Lord himself, one should worship both (“both" refers to the union of the prāṇa and Bhairava, the intellect and Bhairava, the body and Bhairava) externally and internally with flowers, incense, libations, etc., for as long as possible. Then in the body, in the vital energy and in the intellect, one should install the trident with the lotus accordingly. 

This is as follows:196 the root of the staff should reach the root of the basic power (ādhāraśakti)."97 The bulb is perfectly pure having solidity in the interior (with the capacity to hold all); the staff goes up to the roof of the palate, where the opening exists. It includes all the principles ending in kalā. It is named ananta. The knot above it is characterized by māyā; the lotus of pure vidyā is the quadrangular bedstead. It is there that the Lord Sadāśiva abides. He himself is the great corpse (mahāpreta). He is called mahāpreta because everything finds the excellence of rest there, and because He is predominantly of the nature of consciousness, due to the absence of a body in the form of knowable objects, and because of being characterized by the cognition of nāda. Emerg ing from his navel and penetrating through the three openings of his head are three prongs representing śakti, vyāpini, and samanā, above nādānta and at the end of twelve. Above them exist three 

TANTRASĀRA 159 

lotuses with the nature of unmanā. One should make this differ-: ence the seat of an all-pervasive superintending agent, so that it may become one's basis. Then the desired deity should be con ceived as abiding there. The offering of the entire being to that, which is the very essence of all entities, is called worship (pūjā). That, which brings about absorption into it, is known as medita tion (dhyāna). The inner reflection of that, of nature existing in the form of the primal sound (nāda), continuously oscillating, is the repetition of mantra (japa). Following the order of cognition of this very type, by whose force the great fire has been awakened, and which has brought the entire universe to identity with one's own Self (viśvātmikaraṇam), is known as homa. After perform ing that, one should meditate on all the attending deities as arising from the mass of fire as its ignited sparks, and one should worship them in the above manner. 

Meditating on the trident from the root extending up to 

the end of twelve and resting at the top of the wheel of the goddess (devīcakra), one who becomes free from sequence attains the state of wandering in the void of consciousness. 

From the base to the end of twelve, passing like a staff, this consciousness wandering through the void is char acterized by its identification with the void beyond the void. This is indeed void because of wandering through the void, abiding in the void, and swallowing the nectar of the void. एवम् अन्तर्यागमात्रादेव वस्तुतः कृतकृत्यता | सत्यतः तदाविष्टस्य, तथापि बहिरपि कार्यो यागोऽवच्छेदहानाय एव, योऽपि तथा समावेशभाक् न भवति तस्य मुख्यो बहिर्यागः, तदभ्यासात् समावेशलाभो-यतस्तस्यापि तु पशुताति

Even then, external rituals should be performed for the removal of limitations. For the person who has not attained absorption of that nature, the exter nal form of ritual is the main form (of ritual practice). He attains absorption by practicing it. However, even for him, the inner form of ritual is essential for the removal of the state of the bonded soul (pasu). When the external form of ritual is not firmly estab lished in his essence, then because of the strength of his desire it becomes the giver of purity. 

When a person is desirous of receiving initiation, for the pur pose of consecration one should select a spot of land, then worship 

Ganesa and other Gods, worship the small jar and the big jar, wor ship the altar, and then perform oblation into the fire. Regarding indispensable observances (nitya), occasional observances (naimittika), the worship of the altar, and oblation into the fire should be performed. Then, the ritual of the consecration of the disciple is performed for the purpose of producing in him the capacity to receive the impression of purification. It is like making the teeth sour, that is, to prepare him to become inclined to the duty toward the Lord; and as regards the teacher, it is the acceptance of such a disciple. As regards the materials existing in the place of ritual, these should be conceived as worthy of becoming the right materi als for worship by energizing them with the nourishing energy of the Lord, and then offering them. 

Then, preparing this place of worship, abundant with all these materials, the worshipper calls to mind the goddess mālini or mātrkā, and while throwing a handful of flowers to the deity, he should think of them as being filled with the light of rays of those syllables. Then, energizing white mustard, paddy, washed rice, fried rice, and so on with the mantra 'phat' and conceiving them as flames of fire, one should throw them, beginning from the northeast, in a given order. This is the procedure for the selection of sacred spots. 

Then, offering a seat ending in pure vidya, one should perform the worship of Ganesa. Next, he should worship the well-deco rated jar, filled with the substance of delight (wine). Then, placing a betel nut (pūga) inside it, he should call to mind the root mantra in the prescribed procedure as superintending over all, and then he should make the jar charged with the mantra by repeating it 108 times. In the second jar, he should worship the mantra 'phat for the pacification of obstacles. After that, he should worship the guardians of the quarters with their weapons in their respec tive quarters. Then, he should hand over the jar charged with the mantra to a disciple who has been initiated previously, and the teacher himself should take up the jar (kumbha). Then, following the disciple, who goes on pouring water in an unbroken line (from the left of the kalasa) in order to pacify obstacles up to the end of the temple, the teacher recites the following mantra: 

O Indra, in order to pacify obstacles in your direction, you should remain.alert by the order of śiva to the end of the ritual.

With the name having three syllables, the word “hey you" (bhoh) is to be uttered once. Thus, going round from the east he should place the jar in the northeast corner, and the jar charged with the mantra should be placed on the scatterings of the offer ings) to the right of the kumbha. Then, worship of both jars should be performed. After this, the worship of the Lord is performed at the altar. 

Then, conceiving the fire pit as the power of the Lord, and 

164 TANTRASĀRA 

kindling a fire, unifying it with the fire of consciousness abiding in the core of the heart, while cognizing the mantra along with it, and conceiving the blazing fire as of the nature of Lord śiva, then placing malini and mātrkā there, one should satisfy the mantra with clarified butter and sesame seeds; sprinkling water from the water jar consecrates the sesame seeds and the clarified butter, and consecration of the large ladle and the short ladle is the glance characterized by the nonduality of the Lord. Performing oblation according to one's capacity, he should place both ladles one above the other, mutually facing each other, representing śiva above and śakti below. The worshipper should stand, placing the toes 

of both his:feet parallel and straight. Then, he should conceive * that the full moon has arisen from the void, ābiding in the end of 

the twelve from which oozes out nectar, and that (this nectar) is falling on the ladle. He should go on reciting the mantra, ending with vaiṣad, and should remain standing until all the clarified but ter has been consumed. This final oblation satisfies all the host of mantras. 

Then, bringing caru (boiled rice to which clarified butter is added while cooking) that has been purified by the sprinkling of water and offering portions of it to the altar, the big jar, the small jar, and into the fire, the teacher should keep one portion in order to offer it to the disciple. 

Next, the offering of the tooth-stick will be described. It should be thrown by the disciple. If it falls to the southeast, south, and southwest, or straight down, that is considered inauspicious. In that case, oblation into the fire while uttering the mantra "phat will remove the fault. 

The teacher should then make the disciple stand before the sacred diagram (mandala) blindfolded, without agitation, in order for him to earn the right to have a glimpse of the mantra that he will receive in the future. Then, he should sit on his knees and throw a handful of flowers into the mandala. All at once, with the blindfold over his eyes being removed, he sees the mantra directly before him, because the means of knowledge, being graced by 

TANTRASĀRA 165 

the descent of śakti, allows him to perceive the mantra near and directly, and he becomes identical with it. The nearness of the mantra is directly perceived by those whose sense organs have been favored by the grace of śakti, but those possessed by demons see it with dread. 

Then the teacher, worshipping on the right palm of his hand the host of brilliantly blazing deities with his left hand, should place it on the top of the head, heart, and navel of the disciple, burning all the bonds of impurities. Then to the left of the disciple, worship ping the rejuvenating deity having a mild nature, he should pay obeisance to him; then, outside of the place of worship, he should present the offering of wine, meat, and water to the-ghosts (bhūta) and the deities governing all the directions. Then he should purify himself by sipping water. Then, eating the boiled rice (caru) along with the disciple, the teacher should remain awake in the enlight ened state while maintaining the unity of his own self with the self of the disciple. In the morning, if the disciple tells him about dreams that he had during his sleep at night, the teacher should not give him an interpretation of these dreams at that time, as he could become doubtful and afraid of them. In order to relieve the disciple, the teacher should worship the deity with the man tra 'phat.' Then, worshipping the Lord in the former manner and placing the disciple before the Lord, the teacher enters the body of the disciple through the channel of the vital energy, and should touch the disciple's six cardinal spots, i.e., the heart, the throat, the palate, the forehead, the aperture above the head, and the 'end of twelve' (dvādaśānta). Thus touching the six causal deities, he should conceive eight purificatory rites in each of the superintend ing deities, and making the vital energy of the disciple rest for the moment in each spot, he should repeat this procedure. In this way, when forty-eight purificatory rites199 are performed on a person, attainment of a portion of Rudra occurs in him, with the result that he becomes samayin. Then he should worship the mantra with flowers, etc. 

Then, the teacher should narrate the conventional rules for him 

166 TANTRASĀRA 

to follow.200 One should show devotion to the spiritual guide in every way. The same devotion should be shown to the holy texts and to the deity. One should be disinclined to contrary schools of thought. One should see the son of the spiritual guide as one's own. The person who is related to him in connection with study of the text and the person who has been previously initiated should be looked upon with regard. For the purpose of paying regards, one should not think of them as having been born of sexual union. It should be kept in mind that this does not come automatically. Barren women should not be looked down upon as the cause of hatred. The name of the deity, the name of the teacher, and the mantra should not be uttered except during performance of the rituals. One should not make use of the bed, etc. which has been used by the teacher. Wordly sports, whatever they may be, should not be done before the teacher. One should not regard others as superior to one's own teacher. On occasions such as ceremonial rites observed for a deceased person, only the spiritual guide is to be worshipped. During occasional rites, one should not utter the word śākini, etc. One should perform worship on the days of festivals. One should not associate closely with Vaisnavas and others who hold a lower view of the truth. One should not look at those belonging to this doctrine as being members of their former castes, but as being identical to śiva.201 When the members of the teacher's family come to the house, one should perform sacrifices according to one's ability. A person belonging to a lower order of Vaisnava, etc., should be avoided, even though he has been made a teacher, owning to the desire of knowing their doctrines. Even so, he should not be looked upon as being superior to one's own teacher. One should not associate with Kāpālikas, etc., and compare one's doctrines with theirs. One should worship in accor dance with one's own capacity. One should abandon all doubts. While sitting in the cakra, the divisions of younger and older, which occurred due to birth, should not be brought to mind. One should not regard temples and sacred places with greater esteem than the body. One should keep the ultimate truth of the mantra in 

TANTRASĀRA 167 

mind continuously. 

Thus, listening to these conventional rules, and approaching the teacher, prostrating before him, propitiating him with money, one's wife, and even by one's person as his fee, one should then satisfy those who have previously been initiated, as well as those who are poor and helpless. Then, one should worship the mūrti cakra in the foregoing manner. In this way, the disciple becomes the follower of conventional rules which lead him to the ultimate. One earns competency in the practice of mantra, daily rituals, in listening to a holy text, and in its study. In regard to occasional worship, only the teacher is to be prayed to. This concludes the . instruction on the subject of conventional rules. : 

After meditating on all the paths abiding in one's own Self, one should conceive one's self as being full.. Therefore, with a look of grace, one should see the dis .ciple's self pervaded up to the end of the twelve. In this way he becomes transformed into samayin.

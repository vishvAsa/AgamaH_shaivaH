Chapter Sixteen In this chapter the initiation of one who is not present will be described. This type of initiation is twofold, i.e., for the person who is dead, and for one who is still alive (but not present). If a person who offered service to the teacher but died before initia tion, or was sent into exile, or was killed by black magic (incan tation), -etc., or by accident, he should be given initiation if he becomes intent on receiving it at the time of death, or if a teacher finds out from others that the descent of grace has occurred in him.217 This is the command of the Lord. 

176 TANTRASĀRA 

During the performance of initiation for one who is dead, there is no need for consecration, etc. In the sacred diagram for the proximity of a particular mantra, detailed ritualistic activities are needed: exquisite materials, like flowers, and so on; a place as the sacred seat, and so on; the mandala, the sacred diagram, like a trident with a lotus, and so on; a figure (ākrti) as the spe cific form to be meditated upon; the mantra itself as self-effulgent. These [ritualistic activities and materials) are for the meditative yogins and jñānis who are immersed in meditation, who possess right knowledge, and who are devoted to the Divine. They are the causes for the proximity of the mantra according to their order of.. priority and posteriority. What morę can we say about those who have attained the perfect nature of the Lord? 

After worshipping the Lord, the teacher places a figure made of kusa grass, etc., and should look at it following the method received from his teacher. That is: 

When the energy has risen from the mūlādhāra cakra upward, a shaft (danda) from which innumerable sys tem of channels (nãạis) come and spread out, the yogin, by his power, should bring the shaft under control, which should be thought to have gone to the void of the nose, and then thrown outside in order to cause it to pervade the entire world. Then, it should be thrown to the extent that, from the abode of fire, plenty of smoky flames may emerge and cover the entire path with its net. This is the application of the great net218 to drag the desired soul near. 

By the application of this great net, the host of paths which are to be covered come under control and are placed before first and then are brought near later. If all are brought before, even then only the intended one is rescued or drawn before. This application, named net for rescuing and drawing of dead souls, I learned from Śrī śambhunātha.

परोक्षमभिसंधाय दीक्षितेति किमद्भुतम् ।। इति श्रीमदभिनवगुप्ताचार्यविरचिते तन्त्रसारे परोक्षदीक्षाप्रकाशनं नाम षोडशमाह्निकम् ।। 

If this is so, why does it not happen so externally? Is the answer then that without proper practice in dragging it cannot be fruitful? No; when one becomes engaged in such activity, if the teacher is possessed by love and hatred, he could lose his absorp tion of lordship internally. Therefore, in that case, the teacher remains conditioned by the restrictive power of niyati, so practice is unavoidable. But here, in the teacher, on account of the presence of the absorption of [in] the Lord, which is the characteristic of grace, he becomes free. The Lord himself, by taking recourse to 

178 TANTRASĀRA 

the body of the teacher as his substratum, bestows grace on those who are to be blessed with grace. It is true to say that grace has unthinkably glorious capacity. 

Thus the soul, which is drawn by the application of the net, enters the figure made of kusa grass or the fruit of a jāti (Jas minum grandiflorum). However, it does not move because of the absence of the mind and the vital energy, or the totality of causes, but by the force of deep contemplation-it does indeed move. Though it is of such a nature, the purificatory rite of consecration, and so on, is to be performed, which terminates in the final obla tion and unification with the desired end. Then, by means of the final oblation, the figure made of kusa grass and other materials should be dissolved in the highest light of the Lord. Thus rescued, the soul, by the final oblation, attains liberation, whether it was in hell, the world of the spirit, or in the world of lower animals. But if the soul is living as a man, then he obtains at that moment knowledge, yoga, initiation, or discernment, because the body of the teacher is a competent authority regarding this. This is the procedure for rescuing the dead. 

This is the method for a person who is alive but absent when the descent of grace occurs. Only the figure made of kusa grass and attraction are excluded. In this regard, the appearance of his thorough contemplation is sufficient for his purification. 

Initiation, again, is the bestower of both enjoyment and lib eration, because latent traces of the impression of past deeds are strong and because it is impossible to root out all these desires. In initiation, the consecration performed according to the procedure of the higher doctrine is stronger, but that of the other inferior doctrines requires further consecration for the purpose of puri fication. Even the person who is initiated in absentia experiences manifestation of knowledge, and so on. 

What a wonder that the teacher, by his steady absorp tion in the Great Lord, becomes the sharer of the free dom of will. Even viewing the person, though absent, he becomes the initiator.

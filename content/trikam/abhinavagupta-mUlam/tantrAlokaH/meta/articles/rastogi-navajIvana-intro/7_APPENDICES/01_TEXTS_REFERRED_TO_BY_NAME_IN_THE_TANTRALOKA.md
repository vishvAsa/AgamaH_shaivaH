1. An incomplete manuscript titled Aghoratantra (No. C91) is available in the Aryabhaşa Pustakalaya, Varanasi. Brij Vallabh Dvivedi, on the authority of the T.A. 25.58, finds it to be identical with the Svacchanda Tantra. If it is so, it has been published in KSTS in six volumes (Vol. V in two parts) with the Uddyota by Ksemarāja. 
2. Identical with the Aitareyopanised. Brought out with Sam- kara's commentary by Gita Press, Gorakhpur alongwith 10 other principal Upanisads in 3 volumes. 
3. Eight MSS of one Anandatantra-five complete, one incom- plete and two with the commentary of Navasimhacarya-are available in the Government Oriental Manuscript Library, Mad- ras. The MSS are numbered as D5562-69 and R-5314. The India Office Library Catalogue lists a complete MS bearing No. 2541 (Tă. Să. p. 45). One Anandaśāsana is noticed as referred to in the New Cat. Cat., II, p. 118 (Upodghāta., p. 20). 
4. The Anantakārikā is Adhārakārikā, published in KSTS as the Paramarthasara with Yogarāja's commentary. It is a Saivite adaptation of the Vaiṣaṇava/Yoga original which has been pub- lished along with the commentary of Raghavananda in Acyuta- granthamālā.

5. Published in KSTS under the title Paratriśikāvivarana comprising the Paratriśikā and Abhinavagupta's Vivarana com- mentary, later crically edited with an annotated Italian translation by R. Gnoli (Rome). Also published in KSTS with Rājānaka Lasaka's commentary called Lasaki or Laghuvṛtti. 
6-7. Four incomplete MSS of the Bhairava Tantra are report- ed to be extant-one, at the Aryabhaşa Pustakalaya, Varanasi (No. C2927), second at B.H.U. (No. 5446), third at the K.S. Sanskrit University, Darbhanga (No. 296 [12]) and fourth at Bharata Itihasa Samśodhaka Mandala, Poona (No. BL 12165). The Tă. Să. (p. 449) lists one MS at the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal (No. 6041). 
8. By now we know of seven MSS viz.,--the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal (6392), the Curator's Office Library, Triven- dram (T982) and the Darbar Library, Nepal (3/370, 1/296, 1/1160, 1/1557 and 1/147). According to the Ta.Sa. (p. 429), the Trivendrum catalogue lists one more MS as 1103 B and that of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal lists one at No. 5892. All are incomplete but two are quite large. Mark Dyczkowski is presently working on its critical edition. 
9. One MS named Cintamani is listed at Trivendrum (COL 6888) but, perhaps it is not the one in question, since Jayaratha

interprets Cintamani as the Tattvārthacintamani, a non-extant work by Kallata. 
10. We learn of one Damaraka Tamtra at Adyar (No. 6041). But we are not sure if it is the one we are looking for. One Damara- tantra is also listed in the catalogue of the Sanskrit University, Varanasi (No. 24385). Vide Tā.Sā., p. 227 
11 & 19. The Nepal Darbar Library, according to Dvivedi (Upod- ghata., p. 28), stores a MS of some Matagahvarpañcastikā. It is, however, open to doubt if it is one with the Kulagahvara. 
12. Published in numerous editions. 
13. The Iśanasivapaddhati is not to be confused with the Isāna- Sivagurudevapaddhati which has been edited and published by T. Ganapati Shastri in two volumes. (Upodghata., p. 209, fn. 3). 
14. See fn. 45 below. 
15. MSS available in the Darbar Library, Nepal (Vide Tantra Catalogue, Vol. I, pp. 37-42). For other references see New Cat. Cat., Vol. IV, pp. 48-49, 72-73 (Upodghāta., p. 26). It appears identical with the Kalikakulakramasadbhava (116) or the Kālikā- kulasadbhava (1/686) at the Darbar Library, Nepal. We are told

A. Sanderson (Oxford) is working on a critical edition of this 
text. 
16. According to Dvivedi (Upodghata., pp. 217-18), the Kalot- tara is Trimsikākālottara which is another name of the Mat- angaparamesvara. The latter with Ramakantha's commentary has been brought out by the French Institute of Indology, Pondi- chery. We gather that R. Torrella (Rome) is bringing out a critical edition of the same. One Devikālottaragama has been included in the 2nd volume of the Tantrasamgraha published from the Sanskrit University, Varanasi. However, two MSS, one named as Kalottara-mahatantra and the other as Kalottaratantra, have been noticed in Jodhpur collection (No. 290) and the Oriental Research Institute, Baroda (No. 791). 
17. Previously the Kamikagama was published in two volumes in Grantha script from Madras. It was reprinted in Nagari script as Purvakāmika (Part I, ed. Svaminathaśīvācārya) by Dakṣiṇabharatarcakasamgha and as Uttarakāmika (Part II) by Civaña Napotayantrašalai, Cintatripeṭṭai, Madras. 
18. First published from Devakottai, Tirupati in 1932 in Gran- tha script. One MS has been listed at the French Institute of Indology, Pondichery (MS No. 290). 
19. See Fn. 11 above.. 
20. According to Jayaratha (on T.A. 29.56) it is a section of the Tantraraja-bhaṭṭāraka which, according to A. Padoux, is

two (COL1642/A and-/B) in those of the Curator's Library, Triven- drum. The Tā.Sa (P. 512) notes two MSS in the Trivendrum col- lection at 1017A and -B. It also talks of one more MS, complete whereabouts of which have not been furnished. 
31-32. An incomplete MS of the Maukuṭagama is found in BORI, Poona (BL 11428) and that of the Makuṭāgama at Baroda (6827/C). The Tā.Sā. (p. 517) notices one Mukutasamhita in the India Office Catalogue on page 840. 
33. Jñana and Yoga Padas with Nārāyaṇakantha's commen- tary published from Kashmir in KSTS as Mrgendra-tantram and Carya and Kriya Pādas from Pondichery as well as from Devakottai as Mrgendra-agama. 
34. Gonda (Medieval Religious Literature, p. 206, fn. 165) identifies it with the Netratantra which is published in KSTS. If so it is one with the Amṛtesa (Upodghata, p. 14), (Ta.Sa. p. 16-17). 
35. Available in the MS form under several titles e.g., Niḥśvāsa- tattvasaṁhită (1/277), Niḥśvāsatantra (1/279) and Niḥśvāsākhya- mahatantra. The first two are listed in the Darbar Library, Nepal. See Tā.Sã. p. 342; Upodghata, p. 45; New Cat. Cat. III, p. 64. A MS of the Pratisthatantra, being a part of the Niḥśvāsamaha- tantra, is listed in the Darbar Library, Nepal catalogue (1/1003).

36-37. Listed in the Tantra catalogue of the Darbar Library, Nepal (Vol. I, p. 227). Its number is 1/1606. 
38. See Tă.Sã. p. 335. It appears to be a generic name. But if it is identical with the Nityaṣoḍaśikarnava, it is published with the Setubandha of Bhaskararaya in Anandaśrama Series and with the Artharatnavali and R̥juvimarśinī by the S.S. University, Varanasi. 
39. We know of three MSS, all named Pauşkaragama-one at Baroda (6827 a), second at the Punjab University Library, Lahore (number not available) and third, with a commentary by Jñana- prakāśācārya (4395) at VVRI, Hoshiarpur.

45. See fn. 14 above also. Identical with Jñanottara. Published by Muttaiya Pillai from Devakottai, Tirupati in 1923 (Upodghāta, p. 74). The Ta.Sa. (pp. 685-686) refers to a MS of Aghoraśivācārya's commentary on it. A MS of the Jñanottarayogaśāstra (C 99) is reported to be available in the BHU collection (Upodghata, p. 35). 46. A MS called Siddhāmata is listed in the catalogue of the Punjab University, Lahore (1643). 
47. According to the Ta.Sa. (p. 697) its MSS are available in the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal (5948) and also in the Darbar Library (2/32).

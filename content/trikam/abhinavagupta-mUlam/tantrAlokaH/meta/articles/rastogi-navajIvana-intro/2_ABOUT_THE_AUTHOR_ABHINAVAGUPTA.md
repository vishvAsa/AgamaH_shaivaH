(i) Biographical data 

It will be appropriate if we begin with the biogra- phical data as made available by Abhinavagupta in the Tantraloka. Abhinavagupta gives graphic details of his ancestry, parentage, teachers, pupils and cir- cumstances under which the Tantraloka was written.1 

(a) NAME 

According to the Tantraloka Abhinavagupta was not his actual name. It was a title which he earned from his teachers in recognition of his devotion to and reflection upon Siva. This fact has already been emphasized earlier where, according to Jayaratha, his name implied authoritativeness. Abhinavagupta is never tired of repeating this fact. He calls himself competent. This leads to the natural conclusion that

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

he alone was competent to undertake a work like Tantraloka which was professedly a digest of the entire Şaḍardha (lit. half of six i.e., Trika) scriptural litera- ture.1 Abhinava's academic, intellectual, spiritual and yogic attainments were of very high order. The very nature of his physical birth, in the tantric parlance, underlies this. In the first verse itself which refers to his 

parents he suggests his Yoginibhūtva" (i.e., arising from Yoginis.). Such a suggestion assumes added significance in the context of the Tantraloka whose committed goal, as we have seen, is to enable the lis- tener-aspirant achieve Bhairavahood (Absolutic be- ing). Here the parents achieve Bhairavahood which is transmitted to progeny." Thus there is very sug- gestive relationship between his birth and composition of the Tantraloka. This view gets strengthened by another remark of Jayaratha. In the thirteenth Āh- nika while discussing the various kinds of fall of

T.A.V., I, pp. 14-15 

2. Yoginibhū is a typical Kula concept. In the 29th Ahnika called 'Rahasyavidhiprakāśana', this concept has been discussed under Dautavidhi (i.e., practice relating to the female messenger). When parents unite identifying themselves with Śiva and Sakti giving birth to progeny, the latter who is the Siva-incarnate and instant repository of knowledge is designated as Yoginibhu-

grace (Śaktipāta), Abhinava points out to the charac- teristics,1 laid down in the Śripurvasastra, of an as- pirant who is endowed with Madhyativraśaktipāta: 

1. Unflinching faith in God; 

2. Realization of Mantras; 

3. Control over all the objective principles; 

4. Successful conclusion of the activities under- 

taken; 

5. Poetic creativity; and 

6. Sudden or spontaneous knowledge of all the 

disciplines. 

All these signs or a few of them show themselves in varying degrees according to the quantum of grace bestowed. But, Jayaratha, on the authority of his teachers, says all these signs were patently visible in the author of the Tantraloka." This is why such a man whose wisdom (Sattarka-right logic) dawns on its own is said to be initiated by one's own deified awareness and exercises universal jurisdiction. It is, therefore, not difficult to understand as to why Abhi- nava assumes the role of an Acarya (teacher) through- out his work.4

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

(b) PUPILS, COLLEAGUES AND FAMILY CIRCLE 

Two factors prompted Abhinavagupta to under- take the writing of the Tantraloka. He was implored by his students and colleagues1 and was ordained by his teacher Sambhunatha' to write a complete man- ual and bring out the aspects that the heretics were not able to see. Abhinavagupta in his concluding remarks even names his important pupils who were instrumental to his writing the Tantraloka. Mano- ratha, who happened to be his brothers, was foremost among them. However, before he could go ahead to favour Manoratha, other disciples including his cou- sins also approached him with a similar request. Of

these Karna—the son of Sauri, Mandra–Karna's boyhood friend and son of a minister, Ksema, Utpala, Abhinava, Cakraka, Padmagupta-all cousins, and Rāmagupta are remembered by name. A few others also beseached Abhinava who accommodated all of them as it was against his training to turn down a re- quest. We have already come across his brother Manoratha, Karṇa and Ramadeva in the concluding verses of the Paratrimśikāvivarana' being described in extremely eloquent terms. His brother was a great devotee of Siva and displayed command over all the disciplines. Karna, though quite young, had grasped the essence of Saiva principles and was totally averse to mundane attractions. He is the same Karṇa who, together with Mandra, requested Abhinava time and again to write a commentary on the Malini-vijayot- taratantra. Karna had one son, Yogeśvaridatta by name, who displayed personal qualities justifying his name. Karna's young wife Ambat also grew deta- ched from the worldly affairs and devoted herself ex- clusively to the worship of Śiva when her husband died later at an advanced age." It is clear from Abhi-

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

nava's remarks that although Karna's entreaty was a forceful factor behind Abhinava's undertaking, the former did not live long to see the work complete. Ambā, Karna's wife, was perhaps Abhinava's sister, elder or younger it is difficult to say. Because, on the strength of Abhinava's own statement, she looked upon Abhinava as her teacher and Śiva personified although he happened to be her real brother and as such she was successful in keeping the filial emotions at bay.1 And when it came to Abhinava, though a brother, he justified her trust, respect and faith in him as a teacher by his virtuous conduct where the joy of knowledge aggravated his lust for further knowledge," but who also actively nurtured all the efforts annul- ling the sense of delimited existence from heart. This perhaps explains why Abhinava devotes so much space to the description of Karna and his family. 

Next comes Rāmagupta who is referred to as Ramadeva in the P.T.V. He was exclusively given to the study of Saiva scriptures and having fully com- prehended the nuances of Vidhi and Mandala in Trika scriptures was rather impatient to serve his teacher, Śiva as well as scriptures. From the P.T.V.

we learn that he had thoroughly mastered grammar, Mimāmsā and logic also.1 

The list includes his five cousins including Kṣema and one his namesake. All these cousins showed in common their absolute devotion to Śiva and rejection of worldly possessions. We do not know if Kṣema amongst them was identical with Abhinava's illustri- ous disciple Kṣemaraja, the author of several erudite works. But all the circumstantial evidence tends to favour this identification. Although all these are men- tioned as 'Pitrvyatanayah', Abhinava in his Tantra- loka does not indicate who his uncle (Pitṛvya) was. According to Pandey he mentions his uncle as Va- managupta in the Abhinavabharati. From this quot- ation he appears to be a man of literature. While discus- sing Abhinava's teachers we shall revert to him. Since he is the only person alluded to as his uncle, it may not be illogical if Kṣema's father and Vamanadatta are identified. 

The only pupil we have yet to talk about is Man- dra. He happens to be a boyhood friend of Karna and his cousin also, as is gathered from the fact that Vatsalika, Śauri's wife, has been called his aunt (Pitṛ- vyavadhu). The possession of all the necessary basic qualities makes his personality very pleasing and he was gifted with enormous riches and learning in equal measure. It was he who made Abhinava's stay at his suburban residence where all the members of house-

hold including children were dedicated to the divine worship.' 

It was the combined request of all these pupils and his fellow-students who were longing to learn the entire tantric literature that he could not desist from writing the Tantraloka. In fact it was his own deep rooted desire that was awaiting an excuse for an outlet just as a dancer, desiring to dance, cannot resist step- ping when he gets an instrument for accompaniment. Not only the request from students, but also the advice of his teachers to this effect was found by him full of great benign possibilities.* 

(c) PLACE OF COMPOSITION 

The Tantraloka was, thus, written in the suburban residence of Mandra, where his aunt VatsalikāR look- ed after Abhinava with so much care and concern that Abhinava found her name equal to her merits and felt constrained to attribute the success of his work to the all-caring presence of Vatsalikā. His 1. विक्षिप्तभावपरिहारमथो चिकीर्षन् मन्द्रः स्वके पुरवरे स्थितिमस्य वव्रे । आबालगोपमपि अत्र महेश्वरस्य दास्यं जनश्चरति पीठनिवासकल्पे ॥ 2. T.A. 1.15 (fn. 1 on p. 22 supra). Abhinava is silent about his T.A. 37.72 fellow-students. Could the phrase, therefore, be explained as not 'his' fellow-students but as 'their' (pupils') classmates?

gratitude is reflected in every word of the poetic appre- ciation he has showered on her.1 Vatsalika was the wife of Sauri who was king's minister and had later resigned the job when his mind became pure owing to devotion to Siva." 

(d) TIME 

Out of the material covered so far, the portion re- lating to Karna and Sauri etc. is relevant from yet another point of view. Abhinava, though ever ready to provide sufficient biographical data about himself and his environ, does not throw any direct hint on his time in the Tantraloka itself. Abhinava's time is no doubt fairly certain (he is placed around 950-1020 A.D.). It is here that we get some clues on the matter. Sauri appears to be a senior contemporary of Abhi- nava because the latter has seen all the three gener- ations of Sauri e.g.,-Sauri, Karna and Yogeśvari- datta. Abhinava in fact was the contemporary of Karna, his brother-in-law, husband of his sister Amba. Abhinava also witnessed the death of Karna, his close relative and an ardent disciple. Karna died at fairly advanced age (Agrage Vayasi T.A. 37.77) when his son, Yogeśvaridatta, was already grown up. Cons-

truing the present data with those in the P.T.V.1 we come to learn that Sauri was son of Vallabha who was a Brahmin and a senior minister or the prime minister of king Yasaskara who definitely ruled in the year 939 A.D. Thus, Abhinava who belonged to the third generation from king Yaśaskara should have undertaken the writing of the Tantraloka at quite mature age; his accepted date (circa 950-1025 A.D.) continues to remain the same which may be shown in the following tabular form:

(e) ANCESTORS & PARENTS 

Abhinava has provided sufficient insight into his place of origin, ancestors and teachers. Apart from scattered references throughout the text of the Tan- trāloka he has devoted sizable space in the first and the thirtyseventh Ahnikas. His earliest known an- cestor Atrigupta was born in Madhyadeśa which falls

Madhyadeśa is found to be synonymous with Antarvedi' (i.e., land between Ganga and Yamuna) which might be identified with modern Kannauj and was the centre of all learning. His surname was Gupta and his proper as well as Gotra names were Atri, if we go by the explanation of Jayaratha. He was brought to Kashmir by king Lalitāditya-Muktāpīda of Karkotaka dynasty (725- 761 A.D.) out of great love and respect possibly when the latter conquered the king Yasovarman of Kan- nauja (730-740 A.D.). Abhinava has paid glowing tributes to Kashmir, the land of learning, beauty and eternal bliss. Atrigupta was settled in Pravarapura, a decent beautiful town founded by an earlier king Pravarasenas (c. 5th - 6th century) on the banks of

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

Vitastā, modern Jhelum. We do not know if he is the same as the illustrious composer of the Setu- bandha, because Abhinava is silent on this aspect. A house was built on the bank of Jhelum by king Lalita- ditya for his residence facing the temple of Śiva cre- ating an environ of sanctity around the whole place. The temple, too, was located on the river bank and had a Siddhalinga enshrined in it.' The king also granted enough property and wealth for Atrigupta's maintenance. After a sufficient gap of about 150 years in the lineage of the immigrant family of Atri- gupta, Abhinava's grandfather Varāhagupta was born. He was an eminent scholar. It appears all through the intervening generations, about which no- thing is known, traditions of learning and devotion to Śiva continued unabated. Varahagupta's son Nara- simhagupta, also popularly known as Cukhalaka, was Abhinava's father. His intellect was sharp, mind pure as a result of his deep access into all the branches of learning and heart full of devout devotion to Siva.

On the authority of Jayaratha we know that the name of Abhinava's mother was Vimalā.5 In fact

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Abhinava himself suggests it in the very first word (Vimalakala) of the Tantraloka'. His mother died when Abhinava was a child and was brought up by his father. His father though young was in the least distracted by deviations natural to the young age and had developed acute devotion to Siva as a result of complete aversion to the worldly attractions3. Mother's premature death brought a sea change in Abhinava's spiritual life and with the removal of the staunchest cause of attachment, he instantly attained salvation in his lifetime itself. His father reared Abhinava not only physically, but intellectually also. We shall have occasion to dilate upon it later. 

Now a brief pause. In this context Abhinava makes no mention of his brother and sister though we have already noted that Manoratha and Amba were his brother and sister respectively. It is difficult to say among the three who was younger and who was elder. From Abhinava's account we know that his mother died in his childhood and he was tended by his young father; it is quite possible that Abhinava might be the youngest. The reason for our holding so lies in the fact that he was a Yoginibhū in whose birth

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

parental union did not take place for the satisfaction of carnal instinct but as a matter of spiritual necessity. Abhinava's parents must have taken some time be- fore they were able to develop such a frame of mind. Thus his brother and sister should have been born in the evolutionary phase. In any case the mutual gap bet- ween their birth must be small as the father was quite young when he turned away from worldly allure- ments and mother passed away quite early. Regard- ing Abhinava's own family, the Tantraloka is not of much help. It is from the I.P.V.V. we learn that he was a celibate throughout his life and as such the question of having wife or son etc. did never arise.' 

From the foregoing account the following picture of Abhinava and his family emerges :

formative. He received his first lessons from his father, Narasimhagupta alias Cukhalaka. Grammar, logic and literature were the three fields which he mastered under the guidance of his father,1 but the lessons with his father were just the beginning of his extraordinary intellectual pursuit. It appears while he was enjoying his lessons in literature, he was over- taken by irresistible devotion to Śiva which made him serve numerous teachers at their own seats. In pur- suing his ever-increasing lust he did not even bother for the normal decorum and accepted serfdom of his teachers to acquire knowledge.

It appears Abhinava had to face tremendous criti- cism for going from one teacher to the other. Al- though he is an ardent follower of the Sripurvasastra, he quotes from the Mataśāstra twice in the Tantra- loka to emphasize that as a black bee (Bhriga) moves from flower to flower to collect scent, in the same way a student, desirous of knowledge, should visit from teacher to teacher. It is why he flocked at the gates of logicians, Mimāmsists, Buddhists, Arhats and Vaiṣṇavas. He also suggests the order in which he

approached the teachers of respective disciplines. He first approached Vaisnavas, then Buddhists, then Siddhanta Saivists, and finally Trika scholars.' It is a very terse proposition to identify all his teachers by name in different disciplines, yet we get a reasonably adequate account in this respect. 

(i) MATHIKAGURUS & (ii) JÑANAGURUS 

Abhinava's teachers may be divided in two broad groups (1) Mathikāgurus (teachers representing a preceptorial school and thereby a definite spiritual approach) and (2) Jñanagurus (teachers imparting knowledge in general in some specific area). In the opening verses of the first Ahnika he deals with the Mathikāgurus (except Amardaka Maṭhikā) and to- wards close of the Tantraloka (37th Ah.) he first dis- cusses Maṭhikāgurus and then other teachers. Under Mathikāgurus he first refers to Bhutiraja." Bhutirāja and his son, whose name Abhinava does not disclose, represent the Natha Maṭhikā, representing dualist- cum-monist school. Traiyamba Mathika, which is related to Tantra-prakriyā, is represented by Lakṣ- managupta who steps into the shoes of Utpala and Somānanda, Abhinava's grand and great-grand tea- chers respectively." Lakṣmaṇagupta is followed by

Śambhunatha, who represents the Fourth School1. which also goes by the name of Ardha-traiyambaka and is supposed to be identical with Kula Prakriya." Sambhunatha appears to be the main inspiration be- hind the Tantraloka. Although Abhinava has left out teachers of the Amardaka school in the beginning, possibly because they fell outside the purview of Tan- traprakriyā, he utilizes the first apportunity in the concluding verses to refer to Vamanatha who was the son or pupil of Eraka and represented the dualist school founded by Amardaka or Ananda.3 

After discussing Mathikāgurus, he switches over to give out a long list of his main teachers who perhaps taught him secular subjects. The list reads as under: (i) Sricandra Sarmā, (ii) Bhava, (iii) Bhaktivilāsa, (iv) Yogānanda, (v) Abhinanda, (vi) Sivaśakti,

All these teachers, whose favour was earned by Abhinava due to their service and attendance, con- veyed whatever they knew in their branches to Abhi- nava helping him become self-contented and truly dedicated to exploring reality. Since these are his principal teachers, there might have been some not- so-important teachers, about whom we hardly know anything. Abhinava, however, refers to his several teachers in the body of the text quite often, but use of the term 'Guru' or 'Guravah' is so loose that it is difficult to take a definite stand. Sometimes it refers to a mythical figure, sometimes to a preceptorial ancestor much anterior to him," sometimes to the legendary Kṛṣṇa and sometimes to the earlier com- mentators including even his opponents". Moreover, it does not have an exact chronological connotation. However, on the basis of available evidence, a con- jecture can be made. Abhinava studied the Matanga Agama with some Aniruddhas who also commented

upon the Matanga Sastra an Agama of Siddhanta Saivism. Jayaratha seems to have quoted a long ex- tract from this commentary in his Viveka on the Tan- trāloka 8.433-34.' In addition, Abhinava also fur- nishes some useful information about some of his teachers. Dharmasiva, mentioned at serial No. (viii) above, seems to have imparted lessons on some of the matters connected with Parokşṣa Dikṣā (indirect initi- ation). His views are quoted in the context of judg- ing the comparative strength of the rites (Samskaras)2 which were slightly different from those enunciated by Sambhunatha. His method is then discussed from the T.A. 21.50 to 21.55. Abhinava has referred to two Vamanas above with slight variation in name-one is Vamanatha, his teacher in Saiva dualism and other Vamanaka about whom we perhaps know nothing. According to Pandey one of the Vamanas (which one?) is identical with Abhinava's uncle Vamana- gupta" and has been mentioned in the list of his tea- chers. Possibly it is Vamanaka which goes more in

line with Vamanagupta. But Abhinava nowhere re- fers to Vamanaka as his uncle in the Tantraloka nor does he give the slightest idea about the discipline taught. He, however, refers to one Vamanadatta, who on the testimony of Jayaratha, was the author of one Samvitprakāśa.1 This Vamanadatta has defi- nitely been referred to as 'Gurubhih' and not by name. From the content and context it appears that this Vamanadatta talked of variety in the instrumental knowledge without affecting the overall unity of divine consciousness. In all probability Vamanaka is Vamanadatta who was a teacher of Abhinava, but not his uncle. Amongst the remaining Jñanagurus our informations about Bhaskara are in much better shape, though his name does not figure in the Tan-

2. Dwivedi in his Upodghata (pp. 15-16, 65-66, 72-73, 78, 83) has dwelt in detail on the issue except student-teacher relationship between Abhinava and Vamana. He has identified Hrasvanatha, the author of the Advaya-sampattivārtika with Vamanadatta, the author of the Samvitprakasa. The view needs further examination. His other informations are important. According to him the Samvitprakasa was a text with Vaisnava leanings. Its MS is available in B.H.U. Library (Nos. C4003 and C5186). Vamanadatta seems to have written two more books Subodhamañjari (C4235 at B.H.U.) and Svabodhamañjarīmātṛkā (C100 at B.H.U.). If Hrasvanatha, the son of Harşadatta, is none other than the author of the Samvitprakāśa-if Dwivedi's hypo- thesis prevails-he should be credited with the authorship of the Bodhavilāsa also (K.T., pp. 182-83, fn. 3). Dwivedi has disputed duality of Hrasvanathas (Upodghata, p. 66) suggested by us (K.T., pp. 176-183), but without assigning any reason whatsoever for disagreement.

trāloka elsewhere.1 From other sources we know that he was the renowned author of the Vārtika on the Śivasutras, in addition to the Vivekanjana and Kak- syastotra. His father was one Divakara and he was a disciple of Srikantha in Spanda branch and of the Stotrakāra Siddhinatha in Krama. Some liberty may be taken for certain conjectures with regard to Bhava mentioned at Serial No. (ii) above. Abhinava has referred to a series of teachers coming in preceptorial succession who commented on the Paratriśikā Sāstra running as under-Somānanda, Kalyāņa and Bha- vabhuti. If Abhinava's description depicts the chro- nological succession of teacher-commentators Bha- vabhuti occupies exactly the same point of time (calculating from Somānanda) which is occupied by Bhava as teacher of Abhinavagupta. In that case 'Bhava' would be an abbreviated form of Bhavabhuti or should we be justified in reading in the text "Bhava- bhutivilāsayogananda" in place of "Bhavabhakti- vilāsayogananda"? We leave it for future investi- 

gation. 

In this group figures Udbhața also, about whom Abhinava's commentator Jayaratha gives us some information. This Udbhața is different from his ear- lier namesake, who was a poetician and a prominent figure in king Jayapiḍa's court (779-813 A.D.). The latter Udbhața followed Ujjata in succession and happened to be the grand disciple of Bhanuka (850-

900 A.D.), an early Krama teacher.' This tradition descended down to Jayaratha intact through interven- ing generations of teachers. However if both the accounts-Abhinava's as well as Jayaratha's--are construed together, it would appear that Abhinava was in possession of both the Krama traditions-one descending through Govindaraja Somānanda→ Lakṣmaṇagupta and the other through Bhanuka→ Ujjata Udbhața. Since Abhinava subscribed to the tradition headed by Somānanda, he is avowedly in- debted to Lakṣmaṇagupta for his lessons in the whole of Tantra-prakriya comprising Krama, Trika and Pratyabhijñā systems. Udbhața comes in for a lone reference, because Abhinava, though, learnt Krama dicta from Udbhața, his lessons were limited to the sphere of Udbhata's branch of Krama alone and his heart did not lie there. 

2 

Coming to the Mathikāgurus our first encounter takes place with one Vāmanatha who taught tantras of the dualistic schools to Abhinava. He has no- where been remembered except once. From Abhi- nava's statement we simply know that he was either son or pupil of Eraka, who happened to be an ex- cellent teacher. This Eraka, the teacher in dualism, is not to be confused with his earlier namesake who

Next come Bhutirāja (900-950 A.D.) and his son as representative teachers of dualism-cum-nondualism2 initiated by Srinatha. It appears that Abhinava took his lessons from father and son both. As we have seen, Bhütirāja is remembered in the beginning and his son towards the end of the Tantraloka. The Tan- trāloka is silent about his son. From other sources he may be identified with Helārāja, the illustrious commentator of the Vakyapadiya and brother of Indurāja, the latter being Abhinava's teacher in literary criticism. Bhutiraja has claimed highest veneration from Abhinava who views him as another form of the Godhead. Bhutirāja seems to have excelled in many branches of learning in addition to the dualis- tic-monistic discipline. Perhaps his full name was Bhūtirājamiśra. He seems to have initiated Abhinava in the science of the 'size of all the regions' (Bhuvanas) and 'purifiability of all of them' and propounded the theory of hundred Rudras (Satarudras) in the con- text of the treatment of Bhuvanadhvan and Pratisthā Kalā. Another major item which Abhinava learnt

from Bhutiraja was Brahmavidya which consisted of such Mantras which if read at the time of death would lead to instant self-realization.' He also imparted three esoteric disciplines pertaining to Pranava, Māyā and Bindu to Abhinava in the course of discussion on Mantravirya. Several references in the Tantrāsāra to Bhūtiraja in the context of Krama system gave rise to a suspicion among later scholars that Krama was also one of the domains in which Abhinava was introduced by Bhutiraja. According to Jayaratha there was no substance in such statements." Jaya- ratha has also taken exception to his being a pupil of Cakrabhānu (1050-1100 A.D.), an important' Krama teacher. Bhutiraja is one person about whom we have some more informations, most of them provided by Abhinava himself. But we refrain from them at the moment as we are concentrating on the material in

the Tantraloka1 alone. Thus Bhutirāja emerges as an extremely celebrated scholar who was father of two eminent scholars e.g., Induraja and Helārāja and teacher of Abhinavagupta and Helārāja. 

Next comes Lakṣmaṇagupta who commands very high veneration from Abhinava. He comes in the preceptorial lineage of Traiyambaka and is responsi- ble for Abhinava's training in the entire monistic thought of Kashmir including Krama, Trika and Pratyabhijñā branches, excepting Kula. He directly inherited the traditional secrets from Traiyambaka through Somānanda and Utpala. Thus he was direct disciple of the last. We have already marked Abhi- nava referring in very eloquent words to him." 

In addition to Trika, Krama and Pratyabhijñā which constitute Tantra-prakriya, Abhinava refers to his other views also. From the T.A. 15.247 to 254 Abhinava discusses a special type of Nyasa, which according to Jayaratha was advocated by Lakṣmaṇa- gupta' in the overall context of Samayidikṣā. This was one of the six original Nyāsas employed to in- voke and realize Kalasaṁkarşini. Lakṣmaṇagupta differed from Sambhunatha in respect of Saktanyasa."

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

Similarly Jayaratha points out that Lakṣmaṇagupta held a different construction of the Mantras1 as opposed to the 'ancients'. The Tantraloka and Viveka both do not go beyond this point. From it it appears that Lakṣmaṇagupta must have certain work or works to his credit of which we know very little. It is only from another source, the I.P.V.V., that we know that he was the author of one Śriśāstra which, subject to further investigations, may be identified with Sārada- tilakatantra. It appears strange at the first sight that Abhinava neither refers nor quotes from the S.T. any- where, perhaps due to the fact that the S.T. does not purport to be a work relating to the disciplines in which Abhinava was specifically groomed by Laks- maṇagupta. Future studies may investigate if the views appearing in the Tantraloka or Jayaratha are traceable or not to the ST. 

We have now arrived at the ultimate phase of our enquiry regarding his teachers. Sambhunatha, the prime force and motivation behind the Tantrāloka, was Abhinava's guide in Kula system or Ardha-Trai- yambaka school, a school emanating from Traiyam- baka through his daughter. Kula system was also

known as Kula-prakriya.' Among all his teachers Sambhunatha is held in highest regard. He is com- pared to the sun whose rays removed the darkness caused by ignorance from the heart of Abhinava.2 He is again described as the sun in the vast firmament of the lineage of Traiyambaka. He is further des- cribed as the moon for the ocean of the Trika sys- tems. Bhattanātha was his other title or name. It was because of him and his consort that Abhinava shone with spiritual splendour consequent upon the total removal of his sense of duality. It was due to this special calibre, Abhinava could embark upon writing the Tantraloka. The consort here is some Bhagavati, as we know it from another verse." In fact she was the spiritual messenger (Dūti) and has been specially mentioned because under Kula Pra- kriyā knowledge is transmitted through her alone. In other words Abhinava was favoured by Sambhu- nātha through his Dūti Bhagavati." 

Sambhunatha's preceptorial lineage may be pre- sented like this Sumatinātha Somadeva-Sam-

bhunatha Abhinava.' Sometimes Abhinava speaks of Sambhunatha as the direct recipient of grace and knowledge from Sumati, ignoring Somadeva. Accor- ding to Jayaratha one should not get confused on such statements, because the 'teacher' here means the lineage teacher' or the word 'teacher' has to be un- derstood to stand for teacher or grand-teacher, as the case may be. Jayaratha adds to our information by quoting from certain other source. From it, it is clear that Sambhunatha hailed from some seat situ- ated in south known as Jalandhara and was a com- petent authority in the system of five sources thriving on Atimārga. This is an important statement from the historical angle. As we know Krama has been called to have emanated from Northern seat." As against this Jalandhara is described not as Southern Pitha but as being situated somewhere in south.

Geographically, present Jalandhara falls towards south of Kashmir. Could we therefore surmise that Sambhunatha belonged to modern Jalandhara and Abhinava walked down to him in pursuit of his studies, since former's fame had already spread far and wide from his spiritual seat itself. The other significant point that merits consideration is that he excelled in Atimārga, which was perhaps more akin to Tripura system. This problem has occupied our attention elsewhere1 and our information has re- mained static so far. 

Sambhunatha's learning was not confined to Kula system alone. Jayaratha while explaining the T.A. 1.13 says that the choice of diction implies his hav- ing contributed to the disciplines like Trika etc. In order to endorse his statement he quotes a verse from Abhinava suggesting that Abhinava's commentary on one of the Trika Sastras, incorporated his learning from Sambhunatha who had mastered all the scrip- tures. However, as the verse could not be traced to any of Abhinava's published works, it is difficult to precisely pinpoint the system. It may, however, be observed in passing that Sambhunatha exercised considerable impact on Abhinava in respect of his 

1. Vide K.T., pp. 27-29. If Atimārga is synonymous with Tri- pură, it is curious that Jayaratha nowhere refers to Sambhu- nātha in his V.M.V, a text devoted to Tripura school. It is now for the future studies to decide on it.

two other texts e.g., PT.V and M.V.V.2. Since other sources are not our immediate concern we have to refrain from alluding to them unless it is absolutely necessary. 

Abhinava has cited Sambhunatha as an authority on several occasions and on different issues. Abhi- nava learnt Dhyana (meditation), as the first among Anava Upayas, from him. The second Upaya, con- sisting of articulation of the state of vital airs (Prāṇa- vṛttisamuccara) is also credited to the teachings of Sambhunatha. This included variety of blisses from Nirānanda, to Jagadananda. Under the same Aṇa- vopaya presentation of the 'day-night division'(Aho- rātravibhāga the second ancillary topic under the Kālādhvan, i.e. passage of time) and his criticism of other inferior views' carries the imprints of Sambhu-

natha's teachings. In the overall context of passage of space (Deśādhvan)' Abhinava has openly acknowl- edged the debt of Sambhunatha in his treatment of the five stages of human experience such as wakeful- ness etc., being the third ancillary topic under the cla- boration of the sub-categories (Tattvabheda). Simi- larly in the course of enunciating the second ancillary topic, i.e. the procedure of categories (Tattvavidhi), fifteen internal varieties of every category and the like have been discussed by Abhinavagupta only in the light of what Śambhunatha preached him by trans- mitting the entire tradition which the former secured from his teachers. In the same context Abhinava- gupta discusses the categories as symbolized by Prāṇic variety latent in the Khecaricakra keeping within the in- structions of Sambhunatha. In the thirteenth Ahnika while dwelling upon the fifth ancillary topic i.e., variety of disappearance (Tirobhavavaicitrya), Abhinavagupta invokes the criteria as laid down by Sambhunatha as to who ought to be preferred as a teacher between a Yogin and a Jñanin." It is in this Ahnika

that Abhinavagupta does not accept Bhedavādin's view regarding existence of gradation in the descent of grace on the strength of Sambhunatha's teachings.' Moving further we notice Abhinava discussing the varieties of 'general assignment' (Sāmānyanyāsa ) as a third ancillary topic under Samayidikṣā and ascribing it to his teacher." In the same Ahnika Abhinavagupta expresses his indebtedness to him in the presentation of various types of 'special assignment' (Visesanyāsa) and underscores the difference between the two lines adopted by Sambhunatha and Lakṣmaṇagupta, his two teachers, in respect of the Sripūrvaśāstra. Abhi- navagupta reconciles the two positions saying that one should first practice sixfold Sāktā Nyāsas as advocated by Lakṣmaṇagupta and then switchover to sixfold Saiva Nyasas enjoined by Sambhunatha." Samayidikṣā pertains to the daily functions (Nitya- karma) of the aspirants. All round worship of the cycle aiming at adoring the ultimate principle of efful- gence is the sixteenth ancillary topic while the fire-

rites (Vahnikarma) constituted by Samskaras (Sams- kriyātattva) is the twentyfirst ancillary topic1-both these items have been reproduced by Abhinavagupta as he imbibed them from Sambhunatha. Another item of esoteric value was Jalayo ga which was a major constituent of the indirect initiation (Parokṣa Dikṣā)." In the context of the eighth ancillary topic under the occasional functions (Naimittika Vidhi) Abhi- navagupta examines the phenomenon of death elimi- nating the fear thereof and while rejecting other views he swears by one propagated by Sambhunatha. The whole of the twentyninth Ahnika is devoted to Kula- yaga or the esoteric practices according to Kula-pra- kriya, the specific area where Sambhunatha excelled. But even here certain items were propounded with greater emphasis on the authority of SambhunathaR. For instance, the method of worship (Arcavidhi, the third ancillary topic in the Ahnika) included the doct- rine of ten aspects of Homa (offering oblation to fire) which emanated from Sambhunatha. In the thirtyfifth āhnika Abhinavagupta's attempt to strike a synthesis and project a harmonious construction of the different scriptures is again inspired by the teach- ings of Sambhunatha." 

From the foregoing account it is obvious that

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

Sambhunatha exercised tremendous influence not over Abhinavagupta's knowledge alone but also over his basic approach towards tantric wisdom and life. It is a matter of great misfortune that none of his works is extant today.' In certain circles he has also been equated with Siddhinatha, the author of the 

1. However, Pandey assigns one Tantrasadbhava to Sambhu- nātha on the basis of the T.A. 30.99a- 

तुलामेलकयोगः श्रीतन्त्रसद्भावशासने । 

य उक्तः शम्भुनाथेन स मया दर्शितक्रमात् ॥ 

(Abhi., p. 583) 

Dwivedi agrees with Pandey's views [NST (Upodghata) p. 37 and also Upodghāta, p. 38]. This view is further strengthened when we find the same idea echoed in the T.A. 29.212- 

शंभुनाथेनोपदिष्टां दृष्टां सद्भावशासने । 

T.A.V. 

According to Jayaratha this Sadbhavaśāsana is none other than the Tantrasadbhāva [ सद्भावशासने इति श्रीतन्त्रसद्भावे (29th Ah.), XI, p. 136]. However the equation does not hold further. As we have already pointed out earlier, the use of 'Sambhunatha' is not definitive-sometimes it stands for the divine and sometimes for the teacher. Here and in most contexts it denotes the divine source. In the T.A. 20.12 Abhinavagupta ascribes the authorship of the Tantrasadbhava to the Godhead- 

यथा श्रीतन्त्रसद्भावे कथिता परमेशिना । श्रीपूर्वशास्त्रेऽप्येषा च सूचिता परमेशिना ।। 

a. Abhinavagupta reiterates his views regarding the revelatory 

character of the text in the T.A. 30.59- 

व्योमस्विति शिवेनोक्तं तन्त्रसद्भावशासने । 

Even in continuation with the T.A. 30.99, cited above, Abhinavagupta explicates his stand in the T.A. 30.101- प्रकर्तव्या यथा दीक्षा श्रीसन्तत्यागमोदिता । 

कथ्यते हाटकेशानपातालाधिपचोदिता ॥ 

Then on the strength of Abhinavagupta's own statements the Tantrasadbhava is a work of divine origin and Sambhu- nātha, his teacher, could not be its author. According to Dwivedi (Upodghata, p. 38) the work is available in M.S. and the quotes from it in the T.A.V. are traceable to it.1

Krama Stotra, but on a close scrutiny the view is difficult to maintain.1 

Thus, the known part of the glittering galaxy of Abhinavagupta's teachers comes to a close. How- ever, it does not wind up the list altogether, because several references in the Tantraloka to his teachers are either obscure or doubtful and thereby they stren- gthen the possibility of there being several other tea- chers. From the quotations it appears that Abhinava- gupta, in addition to different disciplines, learnt diff- erent texts in the same discipline from different tea- chers, but at the present juncture our informations are severely handicapped. Moreover, his teachers in Buddhism, Vaisnavism and Jainism etc. are not known to us. A few of them may be from the list furnished by Abhinavagupta and a few not-so-impor- tant might have escaped any mention at all. To re- capitulate, the following chart may give a brief idea of his teachers and the subjects they taught on the basis of the material in the Tantraloka:

From Abhinava's teachers we now turn to his works' confining our enquiry to the titles cited in the Tantraloka alone. Interestingly the number of own works mentioned is not large. His first ever reference has been made to one Anuttaraprakriya' which has been found identical with the Parātrimśikāvivaraṇa by Jayaratha. It is to be noted that Abhinavagupta makes no mention of its authorship. He has referred to other Vivṛtis on the P.T. but they are all by his predecessors and goes on citing views from one such Vivṛti in the T.A. 13.150-154. In view of Abhinava- gupta's silence on the authorship are we justified in branding the Anuttaraprakriya as his work? Perhaps yes, for (i) Jayaratha interprets Anuttaraprakriyā as Parātrisikāvivarana, which is exactly the title of Abhi- navagupta's published work, (ii) Abhinavagupta has

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

shunned detailed discussion on the inter se relation- ship amongst categories where each succeeding cate- gory represents the power and each preceding the powerful and commends his another work for a detailed understanding. The problem, inter alia, has been treated in detail in the P.T.V. by Abhinavagupta (pp. 99-218). Abhinavagupta's commendation, com- ing as it does in the Tantraloka, assumes special signi- ficance because the Paratrimśikā has been called the Trikasutra elsewhere and has been shown to serve as an index to the entire subject matter of Trika System,' (iii) The word "Purogamaḥ" (i.c. pilots or precursors) clearly implies that he authored a commentary on the P.T. which was preceded by his teachers namely Somānanda, Kalyāṇa and Bhavabhuti. Profuse refer- ences to Somānanda and his univocal acknow- ledgement of debt to the former towards the end of his P.T.V. leave no doubt about the fact that the reference to the Anuttaraprakriya is to his own work. 

The other work which has found mention is the Maliniślokavārtika where the nature of five sources starting with their origin from the transcendontal base has been taken up for elaborate treatment. One, eager to learn, may refer to it because Abhinavagupta is not in the habit of unnecessary repetition." This text

is identical with the Mālinīvijayavārtika and is a versi- cular running commentary on the Mālinīvijayottara Tantra. This is none other than the famous Śripurva- sastra, the scriptural backbone of the Tantraloka. Pandey has successfully visualized a chronological order1 among all the three works under reference which is as follows-M.V.V., P.T.V. and T.A.- each coming in succession.

In this very context it is significant to note that Abhinavagupta makes an indirect reference to one of his works called Pañcikā. While commenting on the T.A. 23.752 Jayaratha yields sufficient inform- ation. It was a commentary which bore the title Pañcikā and was composed in versicular form as a quotation from it suggests. One thing is absolutely sure that the treatise was available to Jayaratha. Here again Abhinavagupta's reticence on its authorship is intriguing. It is Jayaratha who in another context refers to the Pañcikā as Abhinavagupta's composi- tion. The relevant reference does not give an idea of the original text as to whose commentary it was. Banking on the contextual evidence (Abhinavagupta is discussing removal of inferior knowledge from an aspirant belonging to the lesser disciplines as pro-

pounded in the Śrīpurvaśāstra)1 it, in all probability, should have been an exposition of the Sripurvasastra. If it be so, the work would be identical with one Purvapañcikă included by Pandey among the works of Abhinavagupta. The contention gets support if we coordinate the statement of Jayaratha on the T.A. 16.135-36 where Abhinavagupta dwells on the 'assign- ment of the passage of a syllable' (Padadhvanyasa) in the context of 'variety of the purifiables' (Sodhyavai- citrya) under Putrakadikṣā (initiation concerning as- pirant of Putraka class) with the one in the P.T.V. The work, as held by Pandey, might be an extremely large work if one remembers that the M.V.V. was a running commentary on the first verse of the M.V.T, of course briefly incorporating the total subject mat- ter of all the 18 chapters. Since the P.T.V. alludes to this text, the chronological sequence of the four works would emerge somewhat like this-Malini- vijayavārtika, Purvapañcikā, Pratyabhijñā vimarśinī and Tantraloka. It will be proper to conclude that all these works constituted a complete whole on the Tantrika material in a cognate field. It is significant to note that the Mālinīvijayavārtika was written in the same house in which the Tantraloka was under-

taken.' It aimed at pleasing Sambhunatha and was undertaken at the instance of Karna and Mandra. Similar was the case with the P.T.V. at the time of whose writing, like the Tantraloka, Abhinava- gupta was under the care of Vatsalika' and which was written at the request of Karna among others." The benedictory verse is common to all the three works. The ideas that have been dealt with in one text are skipped over or just referred to in other works. It is an irony of fate that the Purvapañcikā or Pañ- cikā is perhaps lost to us. 

Only one more work that is available from references is the Prakirṇakavivaraṇa. Although the work is not cited by name in the Tantraloka-it is alluded to as 'elsewhere' (Anyatra), Jayaratha interprets the word 'Anyatra' as Prakirṇakavivarana. According to Abhi- navagupta the causative operation (Prayojaka-vya- pāra) indicated in Sanskrit by the suffix Nic loses its primary meaning if it is related to the insentient prompter. The problem is: what is that constitutes the proper object of causative operation-one about which the relative action has already commenced or is yet to commence? Abhinavagupta says he has dealt with the issue in detail elsewhere, hence the reader should better not concentrate on this point here. In the Tantraloka and for that matter in whole of the Abhi-

navan writings there is absolute lack of any other refer- ence to this work. Whether the work is identical with or different from his own Prakaraṇavivarana has been discussed elsewhere.' It is, however, difficult to sur- mise about the precise nature of its contents. How- ever, the word 'Prakirṇaka' stands for 'miscellaneous'. Hence Abhinavagupta appears to have focussed on several relevant miscellaneous issues which were not primarily philosophical but, all the same, carried philo- sophical implications'. Such a hypothesis appears harmonious with the admission of Abhinavagupta that philosophical implications of grammatical issues (e.g., whether an inanimate entity can be endowed with causative action) received detailed consideration in this work.

Abhinava's most works are interspersed with the sprinklings of Stotras. In the Tantraloka, too, we find Abhinavagupta referring to his Stotras at least twice. In the 26th Ahnika Abhinavagupta quotes one Arya and two Śārdulavikriḍitas as the T.A. 26.63- 65. One verse is quoted again as the T.A. 29.76. But the striking point about this Stotra is that it has not been quoted or cited, it has rather been assimilated into the text and made part of it. Since Abhinavagupta employs the word Stotra in plural

(i.e., Stotreṣu) he seems to imply that he has been giving vent to his ideas through Stotras as and when occasion warrants so. In the Tantraloka we quite often come across with such verses which are replete with intense devotion. But in the absence of any definite statement to this effect we assign the sorting out of such portions to the future ventures. Before closing the discussion on Abhinavagupta's writings let us examine an intriguing statement from him. He says that one of the secondary items namely Naimittika (occasional functions) with its varieties has been dealt with in the Tantrasara.2 The Tantra- sarā which is another work by the same pen, resounds the statement. Now the problem is that the Tantra- sāra, as we know, is a shorter version of the Tantra- loka on the admission of Abhinavagupta himself.1 In all probability the Tantraloka must precede the Tantrasāra; how could the Tantrāloka, therefore, con- tain a reference to the Tantrasāra? One thing is cer- tain that the Tantrasara is posterior in chronological order-it was a summary in simple words intended to enlighten all and sundry.

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

In all likelihood it seems to be a reference to some other work of the same name. Luckily Abhinava- gupta in his P. T.V. refers twice to this work and quo- tes therefrom.' In the same work he further quotes twice from some Trikatantrasāra. It appears that both of these texts were identical and were, perhaps, a scriptural work, on the Trisika offshoot of Kaulika discipline. According to Dwivedi3 this work is also known variously as the Sadardhaśāstra, Saḍardha- sāra, Sadar dhahrdaya, Sāraśāsana and Sāraśāstra etc. However, the evidence is too sketchy to hazard a definite opinion. We are, however, inclined to think that while the Tantrasara and the Trikatantrasara for- med one unit, Sadardhaśāstra etc. represented a sepa- rate unit standing perhaps for the P.T. which is rec- koned as the Trikasutra and Sadardhahrdaya" by the Tantraloka itself. Sometimes these very names have

been used to refer to the Tantraloka also.' In the absence of conclusive denotation, it will be better to leave the things as they are at the moment. 

If we shift from the Tantraloka to the material in Jayaratha we are likely to conclude that Abhinava- gupta undertook one more book called the Anupratya- bhijñā. On a closer scrutiny the view cannot be conclusively maintained, because much will depend on how we construe the phrase "Anenaiva" i.e., as qualifying 'Anupratyabhijñākṛtā or 'Abhiprayeṇa'. In view of the obvious contextual emphasis sought to be laid down by Jayaratha, construing Anenaiva with Abhiprāyeņa seems more logical. On such a view Anupratyabhijñā will not tend to be Abhinava- gupta's but rather someone else's work. Our other informations about this work and its author are practically nil. 

(III) Methodology 

The undertaking of the Tantraloka was a very ambitious, massive and intricate project for Abhi- nava. Covering the vast panorama of the anarchous tantric literature of varying hues was no mean task. It appears that Abhinava evolved certain guiding principles, criteria and methods to handle the mate-

rial in hand in such a manner as to weave a well-knit and coherent pattern. It is really amazing to see a subtle unity of purpose and presentation permcating the whole of the Tantraloka without affecting the diversity of content and treatment. 

(a) GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF EXPLANATION 

Of all the characteristics of the Tantraloka, the two are the most prominent-it is a comprehensive com- pendium and a glossorial treatise. Fused together they put the Tantraloka in proper focus-it is a mas- terly compendium written in a glossorial style. As is quite usual with Abhinava, he does not keep us in suspense about his guiding principles. He devotes 10th and 11th ancillary topics - methods of explana- tion and listening respectively-under Naimittika Vidhi (28th Ahnika) and spells out the following im- peratives of explanation relying upon the authority of the Devyāyāmala Tantra1-

(i) Sentences must be interpreted keeping in view the total textual perspective and their consistent cons- truction must take into account the aphorism, phrase, sentence, chapter and section of the text, etc. 

(ii) For lucid perspectival interpretation selective handling of the material or its over-all viewing may be resorted to as demanded by the occasion. 

(iii) The item under reference is to be distinguished from other objects by resorting to various methods defined by common application (Tantra), exclusive application (Avartana), negation (Badha), contextual or incidental discussion (Prasanga) and exploration of the potential options (Tarka) as well as transference of one attribute to another (Atideśa). 

(iv) Each utterance must be vigorously subjected to scrutiny and the opposite view, though to be denoun- ced later, ought to be fortified with stronger argu- 

ments. 

(v) The substantiation of the relative issue by demo- lishing the strongly conceived prima facie defence leads to quicker grasp free from suspicions and con- trary ideas.

It may, however, be noted in passing that the T.S. substitutes Prasanga and Tarka with Samuccaya (conjunction or aggregation) and Vikalpa (option). Abhinava does not explain these words. M.R. Shastri in his editorial footnote (p. 189) adds-T- कारकसंबंध: समुच्चयः, शब्दज्ञानानुपाती वस्तुशून्यो विकल्पः । " Collective presentation of similar instances and statement of an optional instance, however, seem to be better explanations.

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

(vi) Linguistic variants (Bhāṣā), classical and con- ventional rules (Nyaya), close grasp of the pros and cons leading to conclusive appreciation of a theme (Vāda), regular homework at the theme (Laya), particular manner of textual interpretation (Krama)- these are the several alternatives out of which a teacher is supposed to employ one he finds most conducive and convenient for enlightening his student. 

As an addendum another remark from Abhinava in some other text1-we are committed to confine ourselves to the pages of the Tantraloka alone may appear beneficial to refer to. The author of a scholas- tic treatise, according to him, has a multi-directional going-something he has to condense, something to enlarge, something he has to insert and something to skip. It is only then that he becomes a Sastrakāra and is able to communicate adequately. 

(b) MULTI-TIER HANDLING OF THE SOURCE MATERIAL 

It is interesting to see how Abhinava employs all these and many more norms-in his Tantraloka. Quite in line with his extensive treatment his method. has several tiers and we now propose to take an account of them. One, however, must be cautious that Abhinava has an extremely complex style serv- ing various ends at a time, hence certain amount of overlapping will be unavoidable. The Tantraloka be- ing a digest of the Tantras the first thing that arrests our attention is his mathodical handling of the source

material. In this area again his role is manifold. He has to identify the sources, make his pick, scrutinize it and then edit the same before it is reduced to writing. As we shall see later in detail he first sorts out the source material under three heads (1) basic, (2) general and (3) specific. For instance, the M.V.T. is the basic source, the SV.T. and Sp.K. are the gene- ral sources and the remaining are the specific sources pertaining to the specific items. In culling material from them his first criterion is utility (upayoga)'. Even if a thing has been discussed at length in the original sources, Abhinava would avoid touching up- on it if it does not serve the purpose in hand. The notion of utility includes that of relevance as well. Abhinava, though, categorically dispels doubts regarding his capacity for an elaborate treatment, he would scrupulously restrict himself to the relevant material and move ahead. Abhinava's third criterion is to conform to the factual position. Even though a specific treatment may sometimes look at variance with his known stand, he would not feel shy of record- ing the same. His fourth guiding principle behind a specific selection is its consistency with the general theme. Sometimes a text (the M.V.T. in this case) that may be wholly relevant as being advocate of a

consistent theory is quoted at random only to high- light its uniform approach. His choice is quite deli- berate being invariably guided by the twin canons of consistency and relevance and in so doing he would not desist from rearranging the whole thing. This will perhaps explain the two conflicting approaches in the 16th and 19th Ahnikas. It is the demand of relevance that they, though opposed to one another, fit in the two different chapters dealing with the 'assignment of purifying Mantras' in respect of the 'puri- fiable categories’and the ‘assignment of words' in res- pect of the 'instant passing away' respectively. His unflinching faith in relevance and utility is further exemplified by his handling of Dhyana (meditation) -a sub-upaya under Aṇava. Anava-upaya in a sense is a series of sub-upayas where, as per agamic order, Uccara comes first followed by Karaṇa, Dhyana and Varna respectively. Abhinava here interferes with the agamic sequence and places Dhyana in the beginning to be followed by Uccara, Karana and Varna in that succession owing to their respective superior efficacy.*

One of the reasons for selective treatment lies in the difficulty in understanding the original source. He prefers dealing with the incomprehensible material omitting the casier one.' But that does not mean he would compromise authenticity for convenience. He would not commit an agamic source even when he is sure of its stand, to a particular thesis, if the same has not been unequivocally propounded." Thus while authenticity guides enumeration, casy comprehension guides omission. According to Jayaratha one of the criteria that guided the selective treatment was prac- ticability and general applicability. It is possible he might have propounded different views of different people in some other writings, but it is impossible and impractical to take cognizance of all the views at one place. Notwithstanding adherence to these

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

norms occasionally, though sparsely, there appears to be an element of casualness in Abhinava's treat- ment. At such places Abhinava does not go deep, but restricts himself to the surface material. For example, Ananta, the presiding deity of the earthy re- gions (regions finding berth in the category called earth), is depicted as seated on a boat 'within' waters.1 Now the word 'within' (Antah) is either interpreted as 'residing above' (i.e., outside) or as 'gradual pre- sence' (of 100 Rudras beginning with Ananta) but in no case as 'inside'. Why did Abhinava, instead, not choose a clearer expression to avoid likely confusion? Jayaratha suggests that as Abhinava's main pre- occupation was to produce a compendium he made a cursory choice of the material as it appeared on the face of it, if it did not affect his logical position. This type of choice has been designated as 'expanded' or 'shallow" (Uttana) and Abhinava takes recourse to it several times. Reasons of space and fear of un- wieldy size of the text also placed certain constraints on Abhinava in the final selection of his material." But such a situation is consequent upon one of the three courses adopted by Abhinava-(1) He has al- ready dealt with the similar material from other sour-

ces and candidly admits existence of the additional connected material which he has not deliberately used. In this context he occasionally advises the reader to refer to the original text itself;1 (2) Some- times he implies that his treatment is strictly confined to the basic sources and further reference to other sources will add only unnecessary bulk to the work; ( 3 ) A thing may be relevant and contextually justi- fiable to refer to, but it leads to innumerable varieties depending upon the individual preferences. For example, in the M.V.T. (Sripūrvaśāstra) elemental sub- mergence (Bhautāvesa) finds place after fifty varieties of Rudraśakti-samāveśa, but Abhinava though admit- ting its relevance and utility chooses to skip it.3 But he continues to have an open mind. As and when he finds his 'basic' sources less vocal, he does not shirk laying his hands on other cognate sources.

Likewise Abhinava has tried to fashion a model for interpreting the source material. In all his writing Abhinava's obsession with three aims is obvious. They are (1) authenticity (2) unambiguity and (3) communicability. First of all, therefore, he tries to find out the meaning of the word employed, then grapples with the sentence' and then discovers its implication and if the same still lacks in clarity, he picks up a suitable illustration. While looking for denotation of a word he tries to fix up a modality for interpretation-whether it is to be explained literally,^ etymologically or by implication. Sometimes even if some scriptural authority on an etymology or linguis- tic construction is not readily available, Abhinava would like one to exercise one's common sense, as it is not always possible to lay down everything in a book. He always calls upon the intelligent reader to make his own guesses and draw inferences from a logical construction of the source texts, even if there is no explicit averment. Abhinava is very methodical and meticulous. In interpreting a text he first decides upon the reading and critically edits it, if there are more readings than one or if there is confusion or

difference of opinion.' He further examines the vari- ous interpretations already offered and finally puts his stamp on one. In agamic circles there was a dis- pute as to whether Avyakta springs from Māyā or Kala. While the Rauravasangraha of Bṛhaspati sub- scribed to the former premise, the Sripurvaśāstra swore by the latter. Abhinava sides with the Raurava- samgraha and declares all other alternative views as inconsistent and misleading." In fact he seems to have an air of finality about his interpretation. In the process of interpretation he sometimes replaces the original agamic phrase thereby eliminating con- fusion and according proper meaning to both at the same time. He then identifies the difficult portions. Sometimes it is a word and sometimes it is a sizable part of the text. In the latter case he will leave out the easy portion and take up the difficult one. This offers one of the reasons why Abhinava calls his Tantraloka as the Vārtika. In this connection a refer- ence may be made to the Tantraloka 8.171-178

where Abhinava devotes full eight verses to the ex- planation of the 1st of the two verses quoted by him earlier (T.A. 8.169-170) from the Raurava Vrtti var- batim, as he felt it might be difficult to comprehend' otherwise. Since he does not want to leave anything at the mercy of an unintelligent reader, he once even cites a long portion (T.A. 13.164-195) from the Nandi- sikhatantra word by word so that even an ordinary reader may be able to grasp the proper import. He then, for a proper interpretation, sets upon both the stages of textual investigation -internal as well as external. In the first instance he analyses the whole text and arranges the entire subject-matter in a logical order and in the second he contrasts and compares the basic sources with the cognate sources and also the cognate sources with the basic ones so as to get a clearer and more detailed picture of the issues at hand. For example, in the 13th and 15th Ahnikas

Abhinava makes a first hand, direct analysis of the contents of the Śrīpurvasastra and while reconciling the whole text, he even pin-points the textual portions that supposedly have bearing on the relevant theses (here 'descent of grace' and 'initiation' respectively) being propounded. The second phase (i.e., external) of his enquiry is seen where he abides by the authority of the Nandisikhatantra' or Svacchandatantra when he finds it more comprehensive but quite in tune with his basic scripture the M.V.T. The moment he notices variation, he strikes a note of caution and amends his treatment accordingly. In pursuance to this he discusses five gross elements (constituting physio- logical fetters) not after threefold egoity, as is done in the Svacchandatantra, but as constituting sixteen modifications of Prakṛti.3

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

first thing that appeals even to a casual reader is awareness of this mission that is reflected in his style. He conceives the Tantraloka as an organic whole and every section is so interwoven in order to serve a continuing integrated purpose that it is difficult to view one section in complete isolation from the other. He adopts twofold strategy to achieve this objective- one, notwithstanding his commitment to contextual relevance Abhinava does not consolidate his treat- ment of a particular issue at one place, instead he spreads it over several places catering for the de- mand of related issues; two, he lets one chapter slide into the next and thereby maintains the structural unity. The second strategy is called Sañcaya Nyāya (i.e., analogy of an aggregate or accumulation) by Jayaratha, where the first half of the concluding verse in every chapter marks the end of the current chapter 

2 

1. For example, Karanas (Karana means "intelligent practice' - करणं सप्तधा प्रारभ्यासं बोधपूर्वकम् — T.A. 5.129) which ought to have been exhausted under Anava-upaya (5th Āhnika) are discussed in at least five different chapters namely 11th, 15th, 16th, 29th and 32nd. Similarly, one of the ancillary issues called Paratattvāņtaḥpraveśalakṣaṇāni was a proper topic under Kulo- paya (3rd and 29th Ahnikas) but which has been considered under Aṇava-upaya. Abhinava and Jayaratha, who closely follows him, no doubt have their justifications but they only strengthen our contention that the Tantraloka has to be looked into as a 'whole'. See Jayaratha- 

ननु भेदप्राणविकल्पसंस्काराधायित्वत्वाद् बुद्धिध्यानादीनां स्पष्टमेवाणवोपायत्वम् इति युक्तमत्र तदभिधानम्, परतत्त्वान्तःप्रवेशलक्षणः पुनरयमुपायो निर्विकल्प- स्वरूपत्वान्न तथा इति कथमस्यात्ताभिधानम् ? इत्याशंक्याह-

while the second half the beginning of the next chap- ter. He breaks this rule only once at the end of the 36th chapter where he uses one single half to denote conclusion and commencement both. The third con- nected strategy aims at complete fusion of the quoted agamic text in the body of the Tantraloka. But for Jayaratha we would never know what is the precise source material and what is Abhinava's treatment of it. Quite often we know it from Jayaratha's obvious comments and sometimes by contrasting it against the excerpts cited from the original by Jayaratha. For the sake of clarity we cite just one example in the foot- note below. 2 

This fusion of original, however, with his own treat- ment is Abhinava's peculiar tool which he has used with master precision and canny skill to serve di- verse ends and is not so simple a mechanism as it sounds at the first instance. As we have already seen, Abhinava (i) sometimes simply refers to the text", (ii) sometimes reproduces agamic authority 

1. इह आह्निकादाह्निकान्तरस्य परस्परमनुस्यूततां दर्शयितुम् आद्यन्तयोरेकेन श्लोकेन पृथगुपसंहारोपक्रमयोरुपनिबन्धेऽपि सांप्रतं ग्रन्थान्ते तदाश्लेपगत्यन्तभव- द्योतयितुमेकेनैव अर्धेन युगपत्तदुपनिबन्ध इति ।

2. The text of the Tantrāloka runs as 

तदैव मोक्ष इत्युक्तं धाता श्रीमन्निशाटने ॥ विकल्पयुक्तचित्तस्तु पिण्डपाताच्छिवं व्रजेत् । 

इतरस्तु तदैवेति शास्त्रस्यास्य प्रधानतः ।। 

T.A. 1.50-51 

Compare with the corresponding extract from the Niśātana as quoted by Jayaratha-

verbatim, (iii) sometimes elects to present a gist in his words' and (iv) sometimes partly quotes and partly summarizes. Each one of these alternatives is pur- pose-oriented. In quoting directly he is guided by his desire to remove confusion. When he employs his own language, it is either in order to summarize or to introduce next topic / matter / text after incorpora- ting relevant material from the authority concerned. Sometimes, while retaining the original Agama in- tact, Abhinava reverses the order of subject and predicate and thereby tries by implication to uphold his stand as he has done in the case of the Matanga Agama. In modifying the quoted authority some- times certain altogether different considerations have weighed. For instance, he alters the text of the Sri- purvasastra from 'Na dvaitam napi cadvaitam' to 'Na dvaitam nāpi cāūdvyayam' (T.A. 4.106) just for metri-

cal propriety.' Likewise, Abhinava's omissions or extremely brief treatments are equally pregnant with suggestion. He omits an item or deals in brief with it if he finds its meaning obvious." Specific items are omitted to enlarge the scope or application of the relative subject matter. Abhinava, for example, pre- sents the Sivatumusastra as propounding the contents of the Śripurvasastra itself though with a difference in style. In this treatment among the five sheaths (Kancukas revealing agents of limited individuality), 'time' and 'determination' (Kala and Niyati) have been purposely dropped so as to clear the path for purification of categories, through three sheaths3 Kalā etc. Omission is also resorted to avoid un- necessary repetition or analytical arrangement. Abhinava defines Puja (worship) and though he thinks that Homa (rite of oblation to fire) is duly covered by his definition of worship, he does not say so because Homa, as an ingredient of worship, has already been discussed and is likely to be discussed in future.^ Abhinava is wary of discussing Mala (l.e., dirt ignor- ance) in the 13th chapter again, because he has al-

ready done so in the 9th chapter.' Abhinava, does not mind repeating if it really advances the argument, but he would just keep away from a superfluous re- petition. This is the reason why he does not take up virility of Mantra (Mantravirya) in the 30th Chapter which is the appropriate topic after Mantra and Vidya. Apart from repetition, the fear of unnecessary analytical arrangement or elaboration (Vyasa) is also an inhibiting factor. Since in the Traisiras Agama cycles of power consisting of varying number of spokes (powers) from one to thousand-have al- ready been elaborated Abhinava prefers not to make a reference to them for fear of fruitless compilation and irrelevance.3 

In fact, Abhinava equips us fully to have insight into his unique style. He has three regular practices (i) brief (ii) detailed and (iii) mixed and calls the first two as Samkṣepa or Samāsa, Vistara or Vyasa or Vikāsa respectively. Abhinava has been very infor- mative about the style he adopts in a particular set- ting. He discusses the concept of Sadadhva (six ways) as part of Sthānaprakalpa under Aṇava Upaya in great detail and affirms this fact. Yet at an other

place he tells us that he is going to follow the brief method in dealing with the problem of 'regional enu- meration' (Purasamgraha) after treating the regional measurement (Bhuvanamāna) and scheme of cate- gories (Tattva Yojana) at length.' In fact he fore- warns us in the very beginning of the eighth Ahnika that he proposes to make use of brief and detailed styles both intending thereby to use combined or mixed style in describing Deśadhva. While employ- ing brief style Abhinava may go even extremely brief and present the abbreviated subject matter in a cou- ple of Kārikās after handling it at length. He does so in respect of his treatment of three sub-passages- i.e., Pada, Mantra and Varṇa-of the principal cos- mic way called Sabda (word). Towards elaborate delineations, on the other hand, he normally adopts a three-tier strategy. He first puts forward the other available views, examines them and then enunciates his own stand. While embarking upon a comprehen- sive treatment of descent of grace in the thirteenth Ahnika he initially introduces opposite views, Sām- khya being the main among them, from Kārikās 3 to 36, subjects them to critical scrutiny from Kārikās

37 to 101 and then dwells on his own thesis from Kārikā 102 onwards. In so doing, Abhinava is al- ways seized of the related auxiliary matters as well. His frequent reversal to the 'original' or the 'subject in hand' may be understood only in this light.' In the context of Śivahastavidhi, a part of Samayidikṣā, he starts discussing about various types of initiates. such as Putraka, Acarya and Daisika finding them contextually relevant and reverts to Sivahastavidhi, the original item. Similarly as a part of his over-all organisational scheme the discussion on subordinate or particular issues (Anujoddeśa) follows that on principal or general issue (Pürvaja Uddeśa). As we shall be seeing in detail subsequently he misses no opportunity to furnish proper background of the pro- posed subordinate topic. For instance, in the 15th āhnika, assigned to Samayi initiation, Abhinava be- fore discussing the first ancillary issue i.e., types of consecration or bath (Snanabheda), dwells on the necessary background. The third phase of his style, which we have called as mixed, sometimes has a strange feature about it, that is, the detail refers to content while the condensation to body of the text, as for instance in Samayidikṣā. It means that Vistara and Sankṣepa have varied applications sometimes to the physical body of the text and sometimes to its contents.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR 

(e) PURPOSE-ORIENTED DICTION 

83 

Abhinava's multi-ended style is ably supported by the choice of diction. Since Abhinava is creating a Śāstra his vocabulary and its use has to be very pre- cise and meaningful. His usage of the word 'Atha"1 according to Jayaratha suggests his intention to treat the following treatment as an explanation of his own statement. In this sense the Tantraloka sometimes emerges as an auto-commentary. Sometimes 'Atha' indicates a fresh start.3 Similarly the use of 'Samyak" (adequately) implies a clearcut difference from the basic dualist texts like Bhogakārikā and Mokṣa- kārikā of Sadyojyoti." In a continuing discussion speci- fic repetition is aimed at clarifying the issues. For instance, the lunar eclipse takes place in a conjunction of Full Moon and New Moon and not in a pure New Moon" the re-use of the word 'Purva' is just meant for this. 

(f) PRESENTING THE ESOTERIC MATTER 

The language and style both undergo a change when it comes to deal with the exclusively esoteric matter. As we have seen earlier, the first characte-

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRALOKA 

ristic of his style of not divulging entire subject matter at one place at a time is found to be more pronounced in such matters--he reveals partly, he conceals partly. This is exactly what he has echoed in the Tantrasāra.1 The esoteric matters, which are totally related to one's personal experience, must be transmitted orally by the teacher alone-it is the exclusive domain of the teacher and the taught, yet he delves into it only to preserve the agamic secrets for posterity and in so doing he disperses its discussion over several chapters as has been done in the case of Karaṇas. 

In addition to the dispersal of subject matter Abhi- nava abjures the use of direct language. It has to be subtle. There are four pedestals of a system or scrip- ture specially in the Adi Yaga-Vidya, Mantra, Mudrā and Mandala. After covering Mantra and Mudrā he initiates discussion on Vidya and implies that the topic of Mandala is included in that of Vidya and needs no open description. As an outcome of the same attitude Abhinava has a guarded style to sug- gest the precise Mantras etc. to be used in esoteric performances. This aspect is adequately illustrated in prescription of the Mantra 'Naiṛti bhoh'. Al-

ABOUT THE AUTHOR 

85 

though there is no set rule, the quantum of disclosure depends upon the previously discussed norm of uti- lity.1 

So far we concentrated on Abhinavagupta and tried to analyse the material offered by the Tantrāloka covering his biodata, his objectives and circumstances behind writing the Tantraloka, the methodology adopted by him and the principles governing his appro- ach and his basic aim. This part of the Introduction therefore should serve as a backdrop setting. From here we propose to study his illustrious commentator Jayaratha on more or less similar lines before revert- ing to our observations on the text. 

Only Jayaratha knows how to unravel the mystery-

title = "5 AGENDA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH"

+++

At the very outset we pointed out the limitations of the present 'Introduction'. It is at the most an elementary attempt to under- stand the technique of the Tantrāloka by piecing together obvious but scattered indications about its contents, their organic treat- ment and the guiding norms that characterised the approach of two master minds. An attempt has also been made to enlarge and deepen our familiarity with the environ, contributions, and personal details of the author and the commentator of the Tantra- loka. In Indian parlance it offers a Bahiranga treatment. It covers only two steps of the ladder-where to study and how to study, leaving the third-what to study-for future. Our conclusions are approximations in the present state of our knowledge. This "Introduction', therefore, does not go beyond this point and is not intended to be a substitute for a 'research work' or 'study'. Its purpose will be amply realised if it arouses interest of the scho- larly world to undertake deeper and meaningful studies in future. 

While working on the Introduction it was our intention to in- clude a few pages on the agamic and tantric sources of the Tantra- loka and to undertake a division of its contents on such a basis. But as we proceeded on, it occurred to us that in view of the com- plex and encyclopaedic character of the text and our elementary knowledge we could not possibly touch all the aspects and it would be much better to leave it for future study. It, however, appeared proper to us to share our thinking with the scholars about the lines on which future studies may proceed. Knowing full well there would be many more fruitful ways of doing so, devised by scholarly ingenuity, we venture to set out the following agenda for future attention of the scholars. 

1. Our most urgent task is to have a critically edited text of the Tantrāloka and the Viveka. In the foregoing pages we visua- lised its necessity several times. By the time of Jayaratha the text of the T.A. was eclipsed by corruptions and he gives ample testi- mony of his having edited and restored the text (e.g., the Viveka on 

246 

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

the T.A. 23.23, 23.25, 29.265-66 and 37.4-5 etc.). The printed KSTS edition is in dire need of the same type of approach. An effort is to be made to locate as many MSS as possible and to collate and compare them. This may help settle many such prob- lems as we have seen with regard to the difference in readings bet- ween Pandey's MS and the KSTS edition and resulting compli- cations or with regard to several variants given by Jayaratha which are traceable to none of the MSS on which the KSTS edition is based. As a first step, an internal comparative study may be under- taken as we notice variations in the portions referred to or cross- referred to. As a second step, citations appearing in the T.A. and the Viveka may be compared with their original sources wherever available either in print or in MS. This may be done with an his- torical overview since even some apparently correct readings give rise to historical absurdities (e.g., Bhrātā'pi for Bharta'pi in the T.A. 37.75). As a third step, a track has to be kept of the situations where Jayaratha, though seldom, is at variance with his master. For example the T.A. 8.406 says something, but it means some- thing else from Jayaratha's comments. 

2. As an essential corollary and supplement to the above a comparative study of the cognate but external sources with an appeal to their contents is another primary necessity. To explicate. Abhi- navagupta on the one hand conceives, as we have already seen, the Tantrāloka as a logical extension of the M.V.T. and P.T.V., and on the other composes the T.S. and T.V.D. as representative summaries of his magnum opus. By a comprehensive comparison between the contents of the three texts-M.V.T., P.T.V. and T.A-keeping in view their successively progressive character, a fairly compact text of the T.A. may be resurrected. If one more text i.e., the Sv.T., is also added to this list alongwith its com- mentary Uddyota by Kṣemaraja we may get practically an un- assailable text which will ward off many anomalies arising from the textual readings of the existing edition giving us an additional opportunity to take stock of the scholastic bias or over-enthusi- asm, if any, of the commentators, be he Jayaratha or Kşemaraja. In the next stage, a comparision with the T.S. and T.V.D. will bring into focus the relative importance of the issues. The T.S. has 22 Āhnikas and the T.V.D. only 3 as against 37 of the T.A. In the first instance, while it underlines the importance of purely metaphysical theses, it also projects subtle difference between the

247 

approaches underlined at the two places. For example, the dis- cussion on Vyakhyavidhi under Śrutavidhi in both the texts (T.A. and T.S.) may be looked into. In the third stage, once again the internal comparative study ought to be resorted to this time with reference to the contents and with an intent to loosen the knots. For example, the riddle of Adi (etc.), Prāk and Purastād (earlier), Vakṣyamah (will propound later), Agre (later) etc., as app- earing in Abhinava and Jayaratha, appears to be quite enigmatic as and when the authors choose to keep mum about their specific places or meanings. This can be resolved by a close comparative in- vestigation alone. Such a study will further take care of other gaps in our understanding. Jayaratha, for instance, explains Anyatra (elsewhere) in the T.A.15.521 as Naimittikādau (in the occasionals etc.) and quotes a verse. While Naimittikādau should have im- mediate reference to the 28th Ahnika, the verse quoted is neither found in the 28th nor in the 15th Ahnika. Similarly, as we have already seen, Jayaratha suggests inclusion of the occasional rite (Naimittika) among the daily rites (Nityakarma) in the 15th Ah- nika notwithstanding its apparent misplacement. These two types of complementary enterprises, as outlined in columns 1 and 2, will go a long way in offering a faithful text of the Tantrāloka particularly in view of Abhinava's own admission that his treatment is staggered i.e, he does not give all information at one place. 

3. The Tantrāloka offers magnificent scope for a philosophical study of its thought contents. It is a true reflection of Abhinava's encyclopaedic genius and keen historical sense. It is a complete digest of Saivism, specially Kashmir Saivism in all its variety and splendour. Together with the Viveka it serves as a storehouse of knowledge on tantricism and other systems-both speculative and ritualistic. It not only furnishes the reasoned out philosophical theo- ries but also underscores the evolutionary phases through which the major concepts and schools of Saivism have passed. The theories of freedom (Mokşa) and ignorance (Mala), cosmological theory of reflection (Bimbapratibimbavada), tools of freedom-initi- ation and redemptive knowledge (Dikşã and Upayacatuṣṭaya), cos- mic ontology of six passages (Sadadhva) including Saiva cate- goriology of 36 principles (Tattvas), theory of causation (Kartṛ- karmabhāva) and trans-causation called manifestation( Abhasa- vada), its attendant principle of determinism (Niyati) and bearing thereof on freedom of action and fruition of action (Karma-phala-

vyavastha), monism through Absolutic dynamism, descent of grace, culmination of determinate thought construct into indeterminate pure thought, theory of knowledge famed as re-cognition, ensuing means of knowledge, parallelism as well as synthesis between Jñana and Yoga, concept of reality as pure verbum and awareness or theory of reality as meaning which is an aspect of self-transcendence of the word-all these and many more issues provoke a very thorough, lively and intense deliberation. While other works on Kashmir Saivism like the I.P.K., I.P.V. etc. also discuss the similar issues, the T.A. is distinguished in its treat- ment by its tantric orientation. The T.A. provides a comprehen- sive backdrop setting against which philosophical problems are dealt with not in isolation from but as complement to the tantric, esoteric and ritualistic issues. The T.A. excels in tantric symbolism offering a rich insight into tantric esotericism which has been variously styled as Caryakrama, Rahasyaprakriya, Adiyaga etc. It is from this point of view that the tantric esotericism is said to have emanated from the sixth source or face known as Yoginivaktra in contrast (T.A. 6.193) to all the Saiva systems which are por- trayed as proceeding from five faces of Śiva or five sources (Pañ- casrotorupa Bhairava). Thus in order to have a complete philo- sophical understanding it must combine and synthesize metaphy- sical, ritualistic, symbolic and esoteric aspects as all of them, both jointly and severally, lead to the attainment of the self-divine. This study will ipso facto concentrate on a comprehensive inven- tory of all the places where a particular topic has been discussed and also on all its phases through which it has passed in course of evolution to its present state. Besides, Abhinava's aesthetic theory presents a brilliant example of applied metaphysics. The 3rd, 4th and 28th Āhnikas are replete with such references, specially the 3rd is very rich in its observations on aesthetics of music. Any philoso- phical study worth the name is bound to take all this into account. 4. An historical study is necessitated by the very handling of the source material in the T.A. and Viveka. As we have seen, both Abhinava and Jayaratha display a tremendous historical sense. In the first place, they furnish significant informations about them- selves and their ancestral and preceptorial origins. In the second, as observed by Goudriaan,1 the T.A. comes up as one of the three

249 

concrete sources for dating the tantras. Same is the case, we may add, with Jayaratha also. In the third, their contribution in restoring several missing links in the tradition is invaluable. In the fourth, they furnish and handle enormous tantric source material from various periods of history which must be subjected to rigo- rous historical, chronological and evolutionary scrutiny so that the entire tantric edifice as dwelt upon by Abhinava and Jayaratha may be restored to its original grandeur and authenticity. In so doing we may profitably fall back upon all the available sources of contemporary history of that age-literary, architectural, epigraphical and internal i.e., other works of Abhinava and Jayaratha as well as those of their precursors and successors. Another rich source is provided by the texts from other branches of tantricism spread throughout the country. For instance, the omissions in the Srikanthi's list of the 64 Bhairava Tantras are removed only with reference to the contents of the Pratisthā- lakṣaṇasara-samuccaya, a text brought out from Nepal. Even a preliminary study on these lines is bound to yield substantial results. With gaps removed in our understanding we would be better poised for a fuller appreciation of the philosophical content. 

5. Another interesting and enlightening field of study may be offered by its evaluation as a source book of new information. Abhinava offers many insights into the history of Indian thought and the then culture of Kashmir. His references to some Naiya- yikas (Kesāmcana Naiyayikānām T.A. 2.12-44), Vairiñca Brah- mavadins (T.A.V., III, p. 25), Nástika philosophers subscribing to the negation of soul and not to the denial of the authority of the Veda (T.A. 6.19-20) invite us to explore this unexplored area. Similarly his presentation of the Kaumārila view on Vedyata and its lengthy masterly refutation (T.A. 10.21-57) adds new dimensions to our understanding of Kumārila. Abhinava's presentation of Sid- dhanta Saivism in the 4th Ahnika in contrast to the sister systems opens a new vista of information throwing new light on the evolu- tion of the dualistic Saivism in Kashmir. He is an invaluable source of information on Buddhism. He practically refers to all sects of Buddhism so much so that he remains the only source of many exclusive theories of Buddhists. For example "Abhinavagupta, contemporary of Naropa," observes Naudou1, "devoted a whole

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

chapter of the Tantrāloka, chapter XXV, to study of the imagi- nation during sleep...." Presentation and criticism of the doc- trine of Kālacakra by Abhinavagupta in the 16th Ahnika has eli- cited the following praise from Naudou1, "...such criticism consti- tutes one of the principal sources for knowledge of that Tantric cycle, side by side with the Buddhistic texts themselves, in the front rank of which it is fitting to place the Sekoddeśațikā of Na- ropā (perhaps a Kashmiri), the only text of the system at this time." 

Jayaratha closely follows his illustrious master both in spirit and approach. His references to Mausula, Karuka (T.A.V., I, p. 70), and Pasupata equip us with new insight into the history of Saivism. Similarly his references to Sadanga Yoga (4th Ahnika) reflect the continuity of the Buddhist thesis and its assimilation into the Saiva fold. 

Moreover, Abhinava furnishes a lot of geographical data in the 8th Ahnika and subtle cultural information throughout the T.A. These are but a few glimpses. A study fathoming all the new material contained in the pages of this vast text will, indeed, be rewarding. 

6. The 35th āhnika termed as Samastaśāstramelana reminds us of the synthetic Vedāntic effort represented by the phenomenon of Vedāntavākyasamanvaya (synthetic unity of all Vedantic pro- positions). It underlies Abhinavagupta's synthetic approach which seeks to view the T.A. as an eclectical organism where one system culminates into the other and so on ultimately culminating into Trika system. Thus Tārkika, Śrauta, Bauddha, Ārhata, Vaiṣṇava, Siddhanta, Vamaka, Dakṣa, Mata, Kula, Kaula, and Trika move in a hierarchical order. It will be interesting and significant to un- earth as to how Abhinava propounds their synthetic progression.2 7. The meaning of 'Tantra' as understood by Abhinava is to be investigated. In his T.A. he quotes and alludes to even Śruti (T.A. 3.226) which is an external authority (Bāhya Sastra) as Tantra. Jayaratha, following his master, even refers to Paurāņika Prakriya (Jayaratha on the T.A. 8.58). Abhinava goes on invoking his teachers, scriptures and even secular texts as authority. Now if

all these constitute authority what is the precise implication of the word Tantra in Abhinavagupta. He himself distinguishes Tan- tra from Agama. His use of the word Tantra in the Tantrāloka and 'Tantra-prakriya' must of necessity be in two different senses. Because, while Tantra-prakriya has been distinguished from Kulaprakriya on all the three counts namely, Mantra, Adhåra and Itikartavyata (7.4. 29.5-8)., both have been subsumed under Tantrāloka. If the meaning were identical at both the places, Kulaprakriya would have remained outside the domain of the Tantrāloka. 

Such study will bring Abhinava's attitude towards tantra and several tantric systems into bold relief. In this connection one more topical issue may be raised. As we have pointed out else- where, there was an acute controversy with regard to the exact status of Spanda system i.e., whether it was an independent system or a part of Trika system. Abhinava obviously joins the second group because while paying glowing tributes to Kal- lata, the author of the Sp.K., he does not accord a separate status to Spanda system. Now under Kula-prakriya only one system i.e., Kula system, finds mention, whereas Tantraprakriya subsu- mes Krama, Trika and Pratyabhijñā within itself. What is then the locus standi of Spanda according to Abhinavagupta? 

Even though we are not sure of the meaning of the term 'Tantra' in the Tantrāloka, there is no doubt that all the three classified authoritative sources experience, scripture and reason-have been frequently drawn upon. The entire subject matter of the T.A. is somehow based on at least one of these sources. Some- times a particular point is based on more than one authority also. Abhinavagupta has exploited every opportunity to tell or point out his source of authority. For instance, the treatment of Kala

(time) is based on all the three sources.1 Rise of Cakra is based on experience and scripture (T.A. 7.71), while the pure universa- lity of the divine on experience and reason (T.A. 3.44). Similarly Abhisekavidhi is an exclusively agamic phenomenon (T.A. 23.1 & 23.103). Abhinava does not remain content with general des- cription of the source. He even prefers to identify the source. For instance, his theory of scriptural unity (Śastramelana) is ascribed to Sambhunatha (T.A. 35.44), the brief procedure (Samkṣipta- vidhi) is traced to the Dikṣottara and Kiraṇā (T.A. 18.11). Abhi- navagupta thus affords us a clear peep into his sources of topic- wise treatment. A complete chart drawn on these lines will enable us to know Abhinavan mind and appreciate the thematic unity of apparently divergent sources much better. 

8. Jayaratha throws some esoteric hints in all his benedictory verses in cach Ahnika. A clear understanding of the same will help us understand Jayaratha better. 

9. Abhinavagupta has employed about 76 illustrations (Drs- tanta) to exemplify his stand on various matters. These illustra- tions are interspread throughout the Tantrāloka. A complete esti- mate of these illustrative instances will present Abhinavan think- ing in a much more lucid way. 

10. On the strength of the material provided by Abhinava and Jayaratha, critical studies of the Sripurvasastra alias Mālinivija- yottaratantra (vide T.A. 13.212-253, 15.4-7, 21.2-5 etc.), Svac- candatantra and Paratrimśikā may be undertaken. Such studies will indeed further our understanding of the T.A. and vice versa. The agenda, as outlined above, do not exhaust the areas or directions of research. They simply underline the beginning of our quest to understand Abhinava and his celebrated text.

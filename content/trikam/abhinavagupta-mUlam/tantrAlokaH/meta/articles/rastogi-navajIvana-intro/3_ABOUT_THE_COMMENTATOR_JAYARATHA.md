title = "3 ABOUT THE COMMENTATOR JAYARATHA"

+++

The illustrious author of the Viveka commentary, Jayaratha, is next to Abhinavagupta alone in impor- tance. He is no ordinary commentator. He reli- giously follows the methodology adopted by his mas- ter and creates a sort of complete independent text which not only expatiates upon the Tantrāloka but also supplements, complements and defends as it were. But for the Viveka we would never understand the Tantrāloka. An attempt will be made to evaluate and appreciate Jayaratha's contribution in the pages that follow. 

Following our usual practice that we adopted in the case of Abhinavagupta, we are supposed to begin with the biodata of Jayaratha on the basis of the mate- rial available in the pages of the Viveka. But since in our Krama Tantricism, Vol. I (pp. 209-215) most of these data have already been used it will be better for the reader to refer to those pages. Here we will reca- pitulate only certain salient features to give a bird's eye view incorporating additional information, if any. 

(I) Biographical Data 

(a) ANCESTRAL AND PRECEPTORIAL LINEAGE AND RICH 

PARENTAL HERITAGE 

Jayaratha provides graphic details about his paren- tal and preceptorial geneologies, emanating from the vicinity of Abhinava's period itself. He represented

the tenth generation from his carliest mentioned ances- tor Pūrṇamanoratha who was a court minister of King Yasaskara (939 AD).' He was the grandson of one Śrngāraratha who was also a minister of king Rajaraja" whose identity is not yet finally established but who is generally identified with King Jayasimha (1127-1155 A.D.). This Śrngāraratha, whose father Gungaratha died prematurely at young age, was different from one Śrigara who was the son of Dasi Rājānaka and was the grand teacher of Jayaratha in statecraft. Jayaratha throws some subtle hints about his ancestry and his age-long connection with Abhi- nava. 'Ratha' was perhaps the family title or sur- name as all the members of his ancestral lineage car- ried this appendage with them and so was the sub- title 'Datta' which embellished all the members of his preceptorial clan. Pūrṇamanoratha, the first known ancestor of Jayaratha, was a colleague of Vallabha in king Yasaskara's court, whose son Sauri was Abhi- nava's senior contemporary and whose grandson Karna was married to Abhinava's sister. Thus, there was a close nexus between Abhinava and the earlier ancestors of Jayaratha in addition to the academic and spiritual ties that knitted them together. An- other thing that Jayaratha wants to drive home is

that all the generations preceding him enjoyed virtu- ous conduct, power, plenty of worldly riches," fame, learning and devotion to Siva and thus crea- ted the proper psychological environment that Jaya- ratha inherited from his forefathers. Similarly the entire series of his preceptorial lineage was charac- terised by spiritual prowess," Sadhana," systematic scholarship and virtuousness and thereby offered rich intellectual heritage. 

Jayaratha provides an insight into some of the im- portant episodes connected with his family. Amṛta- ratha and Utpalaratha II, the two ancestors sixth from Jayaratha, established two seminaries as a means of support to virtuous Brahmins in a place

Utpala- ratha II was appointed as a minister by king Ananta (1028-1063 A.D.) whose writ ran upto Trigarta (mod- ern Jalandhar in the north-west) and who brutally crushed the forces of the King of Darads. It was he (Utpalaratha II) who received lessons from his mater- nal uncle Vibhutidatta when the elder son of the lat- ter died within seven days of his initiation and out of indifference and aversion arising from this tragic death Vibhutidatta did not consecrate his younger son3 and chose, at the divine instance, to transmit knowle- dge to his younger son through him, i.c. Utpalaratha II. Utpalaratha learnt the entire concept of spiritual union (Melapa) characterised by Kaulika knowledge which he conveyed to Śricakra, an ardent pupil of Vibhutidatta. From Śricakra, the parental spiritual heritage was handed down to Viśvadatta, whom

Utpalaratha brought to his own residence after his teacher and maternal uncle passed away.1 Viśvadatta soon acquired knowledge of scriptures and mastered his ancestral legacy. He was then shifted to a convent in the front yard of the temple constructed by some Kanakadatta, whose identity we have not been able to establish so far (but who may be a kith of Vibhuti- datta's clan, as the title 'datta' indicates), for perma- nent residence and was provided with a lot of mov- able and immovable assets for future maintenance.2 Utpalaratha II, though a minister, gave himself up for the pursuance of spiritual emancipation and the same thing was true of his eldest son Sivaratha who, though a minister of king Ucchala, dedicated all that he inherited from his father for human salvation and later resigned his exalted job. Similarly Gunaratha, Jayaratha's great grandfather, erected a new convent called 'Acalaśrimatha' which survived, even when the whole city (i.c., Pravapura-modern Srinagar) was

Thus a combined tabular chart of Jayaratha's both linea- ges-parental and preceptorial-emerges as on the facing page.*

Jayaratha's time does not present much problem. He has furnished enough evidence to conclude it is unnecessary to go into details right now that he flourished somewhere during second half of the twel- fth century (1150-1200 A.D.). 

Jayaratha speaks very eloquently of his father Śṛngāraratha. He was very close to king Rājarāja or Jayasimha, like mind to soul. The king fully de- pended on him whether the matter related to collec- tion of money involving intermediaries or to rivers like Ledari which did not involve others.' He was given unrestricted authority over all the infantries and armies falling under the tributary princes and

while exercising his powers as the top brass (Sarva- dhikarin) he introduced a major innovation by keep- ing the regular forces and mercenaries separately.1 He devoted his energies for welfare of the common man and encouraged pursuit of excellence by suit- able financial gifts and grants. He created an atmos- phere free from terror and subsequently developed acute devotion for Siva, something behoving his noble heritage. He was initiated into Saivite prac- tices by Subhata Datta who later performed initiation. ceremony of Jayaratha also. He owed his extensive training in statecraft to Śṛngāra, son of Dasi Rājā- naka, who again seems to have imparted lessons to Jayaratha also. Disgusted to see the ruinous state of some new constructions due to vagaries of nature, he carried out five renovations on the Mahadeva mountain. To him and his wife Kamalā, Jayaratha and his brother Jayadratha were born exactly as nectre and moon came out from the ocean, the abode of Kamala (Viṣṇu's spouse, goddess of riches in Hindu pantheon). These two brothers were delight to every-

body and were equal in merit.' Jayaratha was elder of the two. Jayaratha, however, does not remember his mother Kamala so much as his grandmother Sat- tvā who, though a young widow, displayed tremen- dous forbearance and sacrifice into moulding his father what he was—a profound and versatile man. She in her own right won the unsolicited respect from the people for her virtuous conduct and total exemplary dedication to the ways of the gods and 

ancestors.

Jayaratha speaks highly of his brother Jayadratha who though younger was his junior by a very nominal age gap and was intellectually and academically at par with his elder brother Jayaratha. Jayaratha does not throw any further light on his brother in the Tan- trāloka. Similarly Jayaratha, who has several works to his credit, does not refer to them in his Viveka. Per-

haps he wanted to compose his Viveka as a touch- stone for evaluation of his scholarship by posterity.1 

(b) TWO GROUPS OF TEACHERS: SECOND GROUP CASTING 

STRONGER FORMATIVE INFLUENCE 

Coming to his teachers he mentions four by name who fall into two groups of two each. The first group consisted of Subhata Datta and Srigara and the other of Kalyāņa and Sankhadhara. Jayaratha gratefully acknowledges the deeprooted contribution of the second group in sharpening his academic and spiri- tual calibre. Subhata Datta, being the linear descen- dent in the official tradition, was the natural choice to perform his initiation. He seems to be an older contemporary of Jayaratha because he initiated Jaya- ratha's father also as we have already seen. Subhata Datta wrote a commentary on the Tantrāloka for the sake of Śṛngāraratha who acquired substantial command over the Saiva scriptures from him. Jaya- ratha makes it absolutely clear that while Subhaṭa Datta was his father's teacher, he was responsible for Jayaratha's initiation only. Subhata Datta was the son of Tribhuvana Datta and grandson of Viśvadatta. It is this Viśvadatta who is perhaps remembered as

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

'Parameṣṭhiguru' (great grandteacher) by Jayaratha who ascribes a verse to him and presumably presents him as a Krama author.1 

There is one more reference to Jayaratha's grand teacher (Paramaguru) whose authority has been once invoked by Jayaratha in quelling doubts about one's preference for a particular tradition (out of several options prevailing) as authentic and final. He is cre- dited with the view that one's preference will ulti- mately depend upon one's preceptorial stand. This view is cited to support Jayaratha's contention that his treatment of Krama tradition bears the stamp of his teacher's authority. It is difficult to say if this Paramaguru was Tribhuvanadatta or Subhaṭadatta. Chances are that Jayaratha's reference tends towards Tribhuvana datta because Subhaṭadatta, circum- stantially though Paramaguru, was technically Guru as it was he who initiated Jayaratha into Saiva spiri- tualism. It is, however, very interesting to note that Jayaratha claims direct access to Krama tradition emanating from Bhanuka (850-900 A.D.). While Govindaraja, Bhanuka's classmate, handed down the

tradition through Somananda,' the parallel tradition was lineally transmitted to Jayaratha through Ujjata and Udbhața etc. Although Jayaratha claims to be in possession of both the traditions as also the others, he is direct lineal repository of the tradition from Bhanuka. Since we have no trace of any other person having mastered Krama secrets in the whole precep- torial genealogy other than Viśvadatta, Jayaratha's great grandteacher, it may not be absolutely off the mark to surmise that Jayaratha's regular lincar pre- ceptorial ancestors emanating from Lakṣmi Datta, who also happend to be the ruler of a place called Gañja and perhaps flourished around last quarter of the tenth century (975-1023) and was chronologically quite close to Udbhața (900-950 A.D.) and Ujjata (875-925 A.D.) with a few missing links in between, constituted the regular vehicle for the transmission of that tradition. Our knowledge about Subhața- datta does not go beyond this point. The other tea- cher in this group is Srigara, teacher of Śrngāraratha 

Jayaratha's father in political science. However, by the use of 'also' (Api in Mamāpi) Jayaratha seems to imply that he also learnt something of political affairs from Śṛngāra.1 

It is the second group of teachers that wielded con-

siderable influence on the making of Jayaratha-as an academician and as a top grade spiritualist both. He is avowedly indebted to Sankhadhara for his pro- ficiency in all the secular sciences1 including the science of grammar, the science of linguistic interpre- tation propounded by Jaimini and all other empirical disciplines. Śankhadhara was perhaps known as Sangadhara (if it is not a scribal aberration) also. He owed his acquisition of all the Saivite learning and insight into Saiva scriptures to Kalyāṇa, who was an embodiment of the divine. In fact Jayaratha's blissful experience flowing from the realization of oneness of Śiva is exclusively due to him, who was instrumental in removing all the dirt and mental fickle- ness. No other teacher except Kalyāņa has claimed reverence from Jayaratha in glowing terms in the opening verses of the Tantrālokaviveka where he is likened to an ocean whose drops of compassion made Jayaratha self-realized without the fall of mortal frame and whose sermons were carried out with the

Jayaratha offers a very intimate insight into the matters of his personal teachers. While commenting upon the T.A. 13.3422-blessed is the disciple who gets a teacher perfect in wisdom-Jayaratha cites his own example. Jayaratha considers himself extremely fortunate in having attended on Kalyāṇa and Sankha- dhara who were teachers of perfect knowledge-Kal- yana in Saiva spiritualism of monistic-dualistic charac- ter and Sankhadhara in the secular disciplines of grammar, linguistics and logic. Incidentally our know- ledge is highly deficient in regard to the written con- tribution, if at all, made by his teachers. Jayaratha cites the views of his teacher only thrice in the whole of Viveka-once in connection with the interpretation of the term Mula in the Tantrāloka, the second time while stating the reasons behind his opting for the Devyāyāmala's standpoint on Sikhābija in preference to the Trisirobhairava's" and the third time while sub-

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

stantiating Abhinava's description of real Homa1 (In fact the third one is the only direct statement from his teacher). Presumably these views belong to Kal- yāņa as the context is patently Saivite one. Jayaratha owes three things to his teacher-one, he was able to annihilate all the distracting determinate ideas;2 two, he was not easily vulnerable; and three, he had imbibed the Kaulika experience personally. In fact Jayaratha was a self-realized person during his life- time. By any standard these are not mean achieve- ments and speak highly of the calibre of his teacher. 

(c) PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENTS 

Going by the gleanings from his statements Jaya- ratha, to top everything, was a Jivanmukta' the summum bonum of all spiritual seekers. He was constantly in the state of mental harmony marked by divine ecstacy.' He also suggests that he was the

"blessed" one having smelt the intense fall of divine grace, which automatically meant attainment of perfect knowledge. He was an accomplished Yogin who exercised excellent command over the contem- plation of the movement of breath-respiratory and downward both. ' Free from all doubts he was im- bued with a sense of beatific serenity and his reali- zation of Absolutic harmony induced a feeling of total resignation from mundane affairs. Yet his synthetic personality remains transparent as ever. In the last concluding verse of his Viveka he proudly portrays himself as an encyclopaedic genius spring- ing from a unique blend of empirical and metem- pirical disciplines. Thus he appears to be well-ver- sed in grammar, linguistics, logic, secrets of all Saiva scriptures and none could excel his ingenuity whether it was Trika philosophy or Krama metaphysics. According to the colophon of the Tantrāloka, he earned the same title of being a super-teacher in

Maheśvara's cult' as did his master Abhinava. He seems to have enjoyed a fairly long life, as he talks of being quite ripe in age when he completed the remained Tantrāloka Viveka. His mission might have abortive had it not received tremendous encouragement from his royal patron Rajaraja alias Jayasimha, whose inspiration proved to be the real instrument behind the writing of the Viveka.

(a) AN EXTENSION OF AND SUPPLEMENT TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

Composition of the Tantrālokaviveka was a life- time mission for Jayaratha. He worked assiduously for a major part of his life and the day his mammoth undertaking reached fruition, a feeling of creative joy overtook him. It was the result of a persistent, regular, long-drawn hard work in discovering the essential meaning of Abhinava's magnum opus. The successful completion seems to be the end result of his exploiting all the existing source material. In this sense the Tantrālokaviveka is not just a commen- tary, it is the continued extension of the Tantrāloka.

ABOUT THE COMMENTATOR 

103 

At every step he is aware of the complexity and mas- siveness of the project because it demanded close familiarity with practically all sources of knowledge and highlighted one's apparent difficulty in treading the impassable jungle of Saivite discipline made all the more impervious by the perplexity in bringing out real intent of the scriptures belonging to the con- flicting source-bases.1 He, therefore, owns up full responsibility for all the failings that might have crept in and humbly craves for indulgence from the sympathetic readers. Among his immediate support- ing sources, it appears, were certain commentaries. One such commentary was Vivarana, authored by his family preceptor Subhața Datta, which however seems to have cast little impact on him despite the fact that it greatly enlightened Jayaratha's father. In the Tantrāloka he is invariably guided by his teacher Kalyāṇa, and not Subhata Datta. Perhaps, another commentary was Unmeșa by an unknown author3 whose views were ignored by Jayaratha. In any case there were several, numerous one may add, interpreta- 

1. विद्यास्थानैरशेवैरपि परिचयतो दुर्गमे शैवशास्त्रे 

स्रोतोभिन्नागमार्थप्रकटनविकटे नैव कश्चित्प्रगल्भः । तन्त्रालोकेऽत्र यस्मात्स्खलितमपि महत्कुल कुत्रचिच्छेत् स्यान्नूनं ते हि तस्मान्मम न विमुखतां हन्त सन्तः प्रयान्तु ॥

The above conclusion is a qualified one and will hold true if the Unmeșa is not a commentary on the Srimṛtunjaya-siddha- tantra which is central subject in the context. However, we are inclined to construe it as above.

tions' of various portions and whether they crys- tallised into book form-today we are not in a posi- tion to say. We are, however, inclined to believe that there did exist commentaries which invited criticism from Jayaratha. Indeed it is our misfortune that these are not extant today. It may, therefore, be propound- ed with certain amount of certainty that criticism of existing commentaries was one of the devices resort- ed to by Jayaratha to build up his work. From the very beginning of his Viveka, Jayaratha leaves us in little doubt about his motives. He took up the Viveka not because he wanted to establish himself as an author, nor was he keen to display his unique feli- city in expression. It was his sole urge to let the deter- minate ideas culminate into perfect awareness" conse- quent upon careful consideration of its meaning. Jayaratha seems to have had three types of audience in mind (1) the ignorant, (ii) the hostile or envious, and (iii) the doubtful. While he does not mount any attack on those who were yet to arrive on the scene he is determined to address his work to all the three classes of audience-whether past or present-alike 1. केषांचिदपि व्याख्यान्तराणामासमञ्जस्यमतीव संभवदपि न प्रकाशितम् ।

who without grasping the inherent purport have in- dulged in deliberate show of their expressionist tal- ent. Thus he primarily assumes the role of an edu- cator, a critic and an umpire all blended into one. He indeed sets himself to a formidable task. 

The sense of mission was so profound that it led him to procure each and every text, having slightest bearing on the subject. It was a sort of hunting spree and he was constantly on the search, on his own ad- mission, to devise innumerable devices in order to get hold of such texts. As is natural, his ceaseless effort made it possible for him to take the glossorial job in his stride and a moment came when he did not take time to explain3, yet he was able to turn out the greatest or the most exalted commentary3. 

(b) TITLE 

This superb commentary is now commonly known as the Viveka (i.e., discernment) and has been so desig- nated in the introductory lines appearing in the beginning of the text. But subsequently in most of

the title lines1 as well as the colophons2 it is remem- bered as the Prakāśa (light). Sometimes name Viveka has been retained in chapter-colophons also. Once Jayaratha describes it as the Vivarana also.* It, therefore, transpires that Jayaratha was not very fastidious about the name and himself allowed both the nomenclatures to be used alternatively. 

(c) FUNDAMENTAL MOTIVES 

(i) Attainment of the Godhead 

The basic aim of Jayaratha in attempting a gloss on the Tantrāloka is the same as Abhinava's-to in- culcate intellectual framework necessary for attain- ment of the Godhead or Self-Absolute," yet he does not unnecessarily drag on with this. Unlike Abhinava, who is out to secure divine grace for all creatures, Jayaratha would be content if his attempt succeeds in enlightening just one man. In fact, he prefers to remain self-confined and dedicates, like his glorious master, his work as an offering to the Godhead."

107 

The undercurrent of his entire effort, nevertheless, remains to explore and project the Tantraloka as he steers it clear through the mess that had per- vaded all ranks of the scholarship by his time. 

Jayaratha is replete with unmistakeable signs to- wards the existence of this anarchy. Often he becomes very harsh on these confusion-mongering elements. During his examination of the actual chronology of the propagators of Krama system and their tradi- tional viewpoint, he asks the reader to ignore such people who lack scholastic tradition, have not applied their brain to the scripture as well as preceptorial school and are devoid of any commonsense of their own. Sometimes he himself overlooks many appa- rent discrepancies. We shall soon see several ins- tances of such confusion where Jayaratha's reconci- liatory instinct comes to the fore. By the time of Jayaratha, the Tantraloka's text seems to have acquir- ed several interpretations-sometimes equally wei- ghty-all of which were admitted by him as possible

alternatives. Take for instance the word 'Sadrśa' (similar) in the T.A. 3.5, 1 or 'Kāthinyābhāvatah' (be- cause of the lack of solidity) in the T.A. 3.20 which attracted two alternative explanations. This could be equally probable that Jayaratha himself, for want of absolute certainty, offers alternative explanations. Opposition to Abhinava's views in the internal circle appears to have gained considerable ground and Jaya- ratha has to take upon himself to re-establish Abhi- nava. His frequent tips of endorsements bring us to the same conclusion. Similarly Jayaratha suggests that there was great opposition from one section of scholars to the concept of Tattva-bheda (sub-division of categories), particularly the theory of fifteen sub- divisions, since he asks his counterparts to shun anta- gonism and see reason. Jayaratha himself draws our attention to the complete anarchy that prevailed with regard to the textual reading and order of certain particular portions among the various commenta- 1. सदृशमिति सजातीयम् । शरीरसंस्थान प्रतिबिंबं दृश्यते । यद्वा विषयान्तरोपलक्षणपरतया शब्दप्रतिबिम्बविषयत्वेन व्याख्येयम् ।

Jayaratha uses phrases like-

at least four times.

tors. The illustrations may be multiplied to show that the atmosphere inherited by Jayaratha was sur- charged with suspicion, confusion and ignorance and Jayaratha discharged a formidable task in restoring the correct order and resurrecting the genuine tradi- tional position. 

Jayaratha's obsession with restoring the correct traditional thesis is so ardent and deep-rooted, and in a sense essential, if we keep in view his professed mission, that he raises stormy controversies, investi- gates into them and then outlines the exact tradi- tional stand. 

One of several controversies hinted at by Abhinava relates to the exact number of Kalis ordained by the Kramastotra (by Siddhanatha). Abhinava was a great champion of twelve-Kālis theory in his Tantraloka, but the confusion resulted from misap- prehending the proper approach of Abhinava on the issue whose sole aim was to present Sam- vit-krama while others including the Pañcaśatika and a section of the Kramastotra's commentators were guided by their eagerness to conceal Samvitkrama and present Pūjākrama." This problem arose in the wake of Abhinava's bringing in Raktakālī, instead

We are, however, not quite sure if faar here refers to the Kramastotra (K.T. p. 179) alone or the Tantraloka.

of Sthitikāli, after Srstikali. Similarly Abhinava's exclusion of Sukāli from the list of Kālis evoked a furore among die-hards because it made Abhinava subscribe to the notion of twelve Kālis admitted in Anakhyacakra according to the Sardhaśatika. Jayaratha examines the objection from every possi- ble angle-scriptural authority, textual testimony, doctrinal consistency, chronological continuity, con- textual propriety, scribal authenticity and colateral evidence and resolves that Abhinava's stand in entertaining only twelve Kālis in Anakhyacakra is unimpeachable. In the same vain Jayaratha goes on scrutinizing even the historical inaccuracies and sets the chronological record straight. He says with a pinch of salt that these contemporaries do not know anything about Abhinava's precepto- rial tradition and claims to be in direct receipt of the traditional secrets supplying several miss- ing links on Cakrabhānu, Kakāradevi, Somarāja, Hrasvanatha, etc. and the real purport of the Kramastotra. He then comes to the well-settled

principle that one cannot extract a piece in isolation -the text has to be accepted or rejected as a whole -and although in the case of alternative positions one's sheet anchor is bound to be one's precep- torial teaching, Jayaratha finds his conclusion un- affected on either version of the original text.' This controversy has been raised carlier also on more philosophical footing with the conclusion that there is no scope at all for the thirteenth form otherwise it will render the twelve forms as non-modes of con- sciousness. Although the theory of thirteen forms may be justified with reference to the empirical subject, it has no ground metaphysically. In fact such a sharp division of respective standpoints led to two different schools within Krama system and was responsible for historically different lines of growth. 

Jayaratha refers to another controversy in the course of his treatment of the 'passage of space' (Desadhva). The context relates to the regions as obtaining within the category of earth. There were

varying agamic positions. For example, the stands taken up by the Nandisikhatantra and the Trisir- sobhairava did not tally with that by the Siddha- tantra. Similarly there was some difference of opin- ion if the region presided over by the god Ananta lay within waters or above it. Jayaratha examines all aspects in detail and concludes that internal exist- tence has to be construed as external existence and in fact internality or externality was not the point at issue, what was intended was the 'sequence' alone. Viewed in this light the alleged opposition between the Siddhatantra and others will evaporate. This does not even militate against the position accepted by the Tantrarāja Bhattaraka. Jayaratha does not deny the distinctive character of various positions; what he wants to bring home is their structural and scholastic compatibility.' 

It is neither possible nor advisable to take stock of all such situations for reasons of space. We will, therefore, refer to one more instance and then pro- ceed further. In the course of discussion on the cos- mic passage called Kala (crest) Abhinava does not stop at the ultimate reality, i.e. Siva, being 36th cate- gory but talks of thirtyseventh and thirtyeighth category also ruling out any scope for the fallacy 

1. The controversy consumes about 8 pages (T.A.V., V, pp. 15-22) but the following remark from the Viveka is significant-

called infinite regress. 1 Abhinava's view, Jayaratha suggests, was first attacked on the counts of (i) lack of reasons and (ii) absence of scriptural evidence and then on those of (ii) doubtful support and (iv) devi- ation from the normally accepted position." Jayaratha again gets quite harsh on the critics who having avoided pains of sitting at the feet of a teacher are utterly con- fused about real intent of Abhinava or the scriptural position. Although the ultimate reality is correctly accepted as thirtysixth category yet the problem is how to account for immanence if it is considered transcendent and for objectivity or knowability if

it is viewed as subject or knower. Jayaratha finds both of these anomalies resolved by the enunciation of the 37th and 38th stages. He also says that Abhi- nava's basic approach is to expatiate upon the aga- mic viewpoint even in preference to the generally accepted thesis.* 

(iv) Furnishing chronological continuity 

As a part of his ardent responsibility Jayaratha, as we have pointed out earlier also, has worked hard on chronological accounts of the preceptorial line- ages and has always abided by the preceptorial au- thority. Jayaratha himself recognizes this to be his prime contribution in the Viveka. In his Vāmakes- varimatavivaraṇa he emphatically avers that those who have interpreted or referred to the Tantraloka without having access to the teacher and for that matter uninterrupted tradition have only lent them- selves to great ridicule. In fact his account of Krama and Kula histories and several other important au- thors on Kashmir Saivism is invaluable. For ins- tance Niskriyānandanātha, Vidyānanda, Saktyā- nanda, Śivānanda and his three female disciples,

For fear of detail and reasons of space and propriety we propose to abandon our enquiry here. One thing, however, is absolutely certain that not only he has direct access to the tradition but also deep insight into it and leaves no stone unturned to make sure that the reader is con- vinced about the stamp of finality and authenticity that he puts on it." 

(d) HANDLING OF THE SOURCE MATERIAL 

(i) Four progressive phases and their several dimensions Jayaratha closely follows the footsteps of his master. His major contribution lies in opening flood- gates of our information on the source-material. Thus like the Tantraloka, the Viveka, too, emerges as a major reliable sourcebook on the basic sources with several dimensions to it. There is a discernible progression in Jayaratha's handling of the material and it passes through the following phases- 

(1) Material drawn upon by Abhinava-Identi-

fication, structural information, citation, possible and relevant restoration, critical determination and interpretation; 

(II) Material produced after Abhinavagupta --- allusion, scrutinization, possible restoration, textual settlement and discovery of inter se relationship; 

(III) Gaps creating deviations or controversies- enumeration and reconciliation; and 

(IV) Additional information-substantiation, textual determination, rationalization, underlining poten- tialities, textual restoration and the furnishing of cultural information. 

(ii) Material drawn upon by Abhinava 

We are afraid that in an attempt like the present 'Introduction' it is well nigh impossible to do away with overlapping altogether as emphases vary with angles, approaches and context. Towards supplying the source material Jayaratha's job is manifold. The first is identification of the text or source, if Abhi- nava makes an unassertive reference. The second in the same connection is to identify the exact por- tion of the source and to cite from it, if necessary, in case Abhinava names a source but withholds fur- ther information. For instance, the word ādi in the T.A. 1.46, according to Jayaratha, stands for an agamic text belonging to the dualistic branch of Saivism called Cillacakreśvari-mata followed by an extract. Similarly the Ratnamālā in the Tantra-

loka' is identified as the Kularatnamālā (we get the complete title). Jayaratha also enlightens us that this reference is to the content and purport of the Ratna- mālā and not to its language. He then goes on giving several excerpts from it. The verb 'Pracakṣate' (i.e., say), though vague, stands for the Parātriṁśikā according to Jayaratha who mentions the exact rele- vant spot in the mentioned text. Similarly ' Agame s in the T.A. 4.148 stands for the Pañcaśatika-it is only on the authority of Jayaratha that we know it. Jayaratha cites the relevant portion as well. Jaya- ratha, it seems, abhors vagueness and scrupulously furnishes zero-error information. While discussing Abhinava's allusion to the Matangaśāstras, Jaya - ratha specifically reminds the reader that the actual reference is to the commentary on the Matangaśāstra and not to the Agama proper in order to avoid

unnecessary elaboration. He then offers us a glimpse of the versicular commentary under reference. In fact it is impossible to understand the Tantraloka without the aid of the Viveka. In a single continued treatment Abhinava alludes to the respective orders of the five sheaths (Kañcukas) according to the Sarvajñānottara, Svāyambhuva, Kirana and Mātaiga- pārameśvara,1 but in the Tantraloka's text the Svayambhuva is nowhere mentioned even obliquely. It is by the analysis of the contents that Jayaratha finds an unmistakeable appeal to the authority of the Svayambhuva. On the same pattern Jayaratha hints that Abhinavagupta is not simply referring to but also quoting and in such a case he completes an incomplete quote. Thus we see that Jayaratha does not restrict himself to the provision of name alone, he tries to discover the underlying source. This attitude is profusely reflected in places like the dis- cussion of Malininyasa (an assignment called Mālini) where Abhinavagupta does not take us into confidence about his agamic base, but Jayaratha

comes forward with references to and quotations from the Siddhatantra as well as the Triśirobhairava and underscores the similarity they have with other tantras like the Matabhattaraka on this issue.1 

In addition to the above-noted information Jaya- ratha's job includes the furnishing of structural in- formation in respect of the cited source material. It is rendered possible by affording an insight into the quoted extract. Abhinavagupta, for example, quotes the Kiraṇāgama to substantiate the relation- ship of path and destination (Upaya-upeya-bhāva) as subsisting between the power and the power-ful." Here Jayaratha comes to our rescue saying that this Agama had a question-answer format where Garuda is the inquirer while the Godhead assumes the role of the answerer. It is this long dialogue between the two (of which specific portions have been earmarked by Jayaratha) that has been drawn upon by Abhi- navagupta and put in his own words for the sake of brevity. Likewise the Triśirobhairava was also in the form of a dialogue between the Goddess and the God where Devi asks and Siva answers. We owe this information to Jayaratha, who pinpoints the portion actually quoted by Abhinavagupta."

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

This Agama was divided into several chapters called Patalas.1 Similarly the Urmimahāśāstrasiddha Santana- rūpaka as presented by Abhinavagupta hap- pened to be identical with Kula text Ürmikaulasiddha- santānarupaka and was in the form of a dialogue between Devi and Siva and had one of the chapters called Padovalli dealing with preceptorial genealogy.* 

It is no use multiplying instances. Jayaratha's an- other major contribution lies in retaining certain important pre-Abhinavan sources in more or less complete form. The preservation of the Krama- stotra, attributed by us to Siddhanatha elsewhere,1 in somewhat intact shape" in the pages of fourth Āh- nika is a classic example of the same. Similar is the case with the Pañcasatika, etc. In a sense Jaya- ratha's coverage is no less wider than that of his 

master. 

The greatest task, however, consists in his editing the text critically and determining the precise reading. Jayaratha seems to have worked religiously on it. Here his job is twofold. On the one he handles the

agamic texts alluded to and/or quoted by Abhinava- gupta or by himself and on the other he handles the text of the Tantraloka. For the timebeing we con- centrate on the former alone. In critically handling the source texts he rectifies the incorrect reading- whether due to scribal mistake or due to misinform- ation-, indicates his preference out of the two or more seemingly equal readings, reconciles differing scriptural positions, criticizes his own schoolmen for their deviations and preferences for other read- ings, and finally arranges the texts in a natural and logical order. To appreciate better, let us look into some illustrative instances. At one place' Jayaratha discusses the original Agama, i.c. Svayambhuva, and holds that the reading Kala, which he chanced to see in older manuscripts, has to be accepted in pre- ference to the common reading Kala without which the Abhinavan text would militate against the Kirana Agama. At another, Jayaratha retains Dviti- yam in the quoted text in preference to Tṛtiyām Caturthim, as adopted by a section of misguided scholars while commenting upon Abhinavagupta

who draws upon the Siddhayogiśvaramata in respect of the seat-worship (Asanārcana) and invokes the contents thereof1, because it will lead to unnecessary repetition when construed with the Siddhatantra. In the same context he resolves the textual order and implies that 'Sardhāksarām' qualifies 'Dvayim'— the two are not independent. As seen earlier, Jaya- ratha not only identifies the quoted text but goes a step further. He pinpoints exact reading in the original source in case Abhinavagupta does not strictly adhere to the 'original ' 1 Here Abhinava - gupta reads Pūrṇāṁ and Kṛśam while it is Pinām and Durbalām in the original Vijñānabhairava. Jaya- ratha, at a different place, quotes from a tantra, probably the Siddhatantra if one goes by the con- textual evidence, after correction of Ună into Unām stating his reasons for doing so." He meets the anti- cipated criticism by further reasoning. At another place ' Abhinava draws upon the Mrtyuñjaya-tantra

for his notion of independent assignment (Svatantra Nyasa) pertaining to the ultimate-cum-nonultimate deity. Jayaratha has adopted the reading ‘Ekaikam dvayangulam' in preference to 'Ekaikadyangulam' and vehemently ridicules those who opt for such a reading by a curious mixture of the preceding and the following confusing both because such a reading clearly nullifies the original agamic reading, brings in the element of farfetched imagination, lacks the use of the word 'again' and also violates the explana- tions offered by the teachers. These examples, though handful, will indeed help us gather an idea about Jayaratha's careful diligence. 

The next step Jayaratha takes is to accord a pro- per interpretation. He addresses himself to the task of giving the most appropriate and relevant inter- pretation. As a rule he feels shy of bringing in other interpretations in spite of their probability. Nor does he harp on their patent mutual inconsistency, if the same is irrelevant. It is of course very natural for Jayaratha to hunt out the exact basic source be- hind Abhinava's specific thesis or pronouncement. For example, while initiating discussion on the 'division of day and night' as a sequel to the 'move- ment of breath' (Prāṇacāramāna) he underscores Abhinava's heavy dependence upon the Svacchanda Tantra. But it is also his bounden duty to point out the lines on which the source authority is to be under- stood with a warning of the impending negative results. Abhinava invokes the authority of the Para-

gruous interpretation. For instance, he explains the word Antaḥ in Abhinava's text, which is based on the Devyāyamala Tantra in the context, not as 'with- in' but as just above it. But in arriving at this interpretation he has to compare and contrast a host of Agamas and synthesize their anomalous stands and then to conclude that Abhinavagupta's leaning towards a general, and hence casual, survey is sometimes responsible for such expressions. Jaya- ratha intends his method to be a trend setter for interpretation of the cognate tantric material." 

(iii) Pre-Abhinavan tantric material 

The same approach permeates his handling of the tantric material, whether of Abhinavan, pre-, or post-Abhinavan era. In the absence of a clearly worked-out chronological analysis of this material our remarks have to be limited to the works quoted by Jayaratha on his own. Very often he draws upon those sections of pre-Abhinavan material which have remained untouched by Abhinavagupta. Des- pite Abhinavagupta's extensive coverage, a lot of material from hitherto unknown sources has found its way into Jayaratha which is of immense value

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

for any future chronicle of tantric history. Of all the works referred to by Jayaratha, his allusions to the Srikanthi are highly significant' for the study of the ten Śiva tantras, eighteen Rudra tantras and sixtyfour Bhairava tantras (divided into eight groups) belonging to the dualistic, dualistic-cum-monistic and monistic schools. Jayaratha gives a few lengthy quotations incorporating the names of all the tan- tras. Though it is difficult to ascertain its period, the first ever reference to it is found in the Uddyota of Kṣemarāja on the Svacchanda Tantra3 which also testifies to Jayaratha's description about the subject- matter. Among other agamic texts he refers to the Kramasadbhāva, Sardhaśatika, Anandeśvaratantra, Pañcāmṛta Bhūtakṣobha, Anantavijaya, Kulakramo- daya and Kula-kriḍāvatāra for the first time. As is usual he not only quotes but also informs about their formal structure, subject matter and crucial points which evoked special interest. For instance, the Krama sadbhāva was an Agama of Nigama class and there was a sharp difference of opinion whether it advocated worship of sixteen or seventeen deities.*

The Sardhasatika, which Jayaratha quotes four times', closely follows on the heels of the Pañcaśatika and explicitly differs from the Kramasadbhāva re- garding the order. Similarly it is to his credit that we know that the Anandesvara-tantra comprised twelve thousand verses. According to Dwivedi it was possibly a tantra belonging to the Left Path." It advocated Tarpana (offering libations of water) with the aid of the thumb and the middle finger. The Bhutakṣobha and Pañcāmṛta were other two Agamas that followed the trail. The Anantavijaya was a tantra belonging to Siddhanta Saivism which Jayaratha considers extremely dissimilar. He falls back upon it because the matter under reference has not been treated in sister tantras. The Kulakramo- daya, perhaps a Kula tantra, was devoted to the discussion of the method of assignment in the body conceived as a spiritual seat. As one of the topics Jayaratha specifically mentions the part of the text that focussed on the issue.' Jayaratha's references to

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

the Kulakriḍāvatāra are at par with those to the Śrikanthi for a proper grasp of esoteric items like Ovalli, Mudrā, Chummā, Pallī, Pitha and Ghara of the six competent teacher-princes etc. There are also necessary to understand the precise internal charac- ter of a preceptorial tradition, because these vary from preceptor to preceptor.' Jayaratha quotes this Agama on each of these topics. In addition, a sub- stantial number of innumerable references to the unidentified Agamas, which until independently dis- tinguished, must belong to Agamas of this period. 

(iv) Source material provided by the known authors 

The other segment of the source-material is pro- vided by the works of known authors. Among these Abhinavagupta occupies the place of glory. Besides references to his famous treatises like Isvarpratya- bhijñā-vimarśinī, Tantrasara, Tantraloka, Annuttrā- stika and Paramarthasara, Jayaratha earns our grati- tude for his reference to the Kramakeli, Abhinava- gupta's celebrated commentary on the Kramastotra by Siddhanatha. The early history of Krama system would not be possible without the rich material provided by Jayaratha from this text. Jayaratha, apparently cites a long quote throwing enormous

light on Krama system as it stood before Abhinava- gupta.' Jayaratha also refers to other little known. texts such as the Anupratyabhijñā."

(v) Post-Abhinavagupta tantric material: general Towards the post-Abhinavagupta period Jaya- ratha's references to Somaraja, Bhojarāja and his suspected work Kramakamala' are very important towards reconstruction of the history of Krama system. It is for the first time again that we hear of some Prasastibhutipada and Tapasviraja" in the pages of the Viveka. Similarly his mention of his great grandteacher Viśvadatta, his grandteacher' Tribhuvanadatta and teacher Kalyāṇa, as we have already noted in a different context, lend tremendous help towards capturing the evolution of monistic thought in Kashmir.

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

in Trivendrum Sanskrit Series and assigned to Sivā- nanda II by us,' offer unimpeachable evidence of direct North-South dialogue after Madhuraja Yogin, Abhinava's junior contemporary and author of the Gurunathaparāmarśa. 

(a) JAYARATHA VS. KṢEMARĀJA 

His treatment of Kṣemarāja, however, is by far the most remarkable event of this phase, which reflects his uncompromising fervour for a thoroughly scienti- fic study of the tantric material. Notwithstanding his innocuous references to the Pratyabhijñāhṛdaya2, he has virtually mounted an attack on Kṣemarāja when it comes to the precise handling of the agamic sources. It is here we find Jayaratha sincerely translating his abiding commitment of keeping the misguided and the confused at bay from the sacrosanct domain of the tantric studies. 

The Svacchanda Tantra is one of the premier sour- ces of authority for the Tantraloka next in importance to the Malinivijayottara Tantra. Jayaratha, in his un- swerving desire to supply the root material for cor- rect understanding of the Tantraloka, profusely quotes (more than 300 times) the relevant portions from the SV.T. and in this process he frequently finds Kşemaraja's readings and organisation of the text as adopted in the latter's commentary "Uddyota" quite misleading. Luckily the text of the Kṣemarāja's commentary and the text as available to or adopted by him is available in print in KSTS (Vols. 31, 38, 44, 48, 51, 53, 56; pub. 1921-1935) and the same may be referred to for a handy appraisal. It also shows

that the agamic text was in a fluid state and a criti- cal edition of the same was attempted by Jayaratha and Kṣemaraja both. The size and number of re- gions (Purānāṁ Parimaṇam) in the eighth Ahnika, for example, is obviously based on the SV.T. Accord- ing to Jayaratha the T.A. 8. 132-138 specifically covers SV.T. 10. 431-464. Here Jayaratha reproduces ex- act verses from the SV.T. which correspond to the SV.T. 10.453-543 and 10.4324 in the printed edition and warns the student not to be duped by Kṣema- raja's readings". He accordingly settles down for Viṣāvarte and Pañcasat for Samvarta and Satãd. In the same context Jayaratha upholds Abhinavagupta's mention of Rūpavrata which is not found in Kṣ- ema's text at all. He digs at Kṣemarāja that the latter possibly has missed the relevant second half of the

which seems to have been the reading, as available to Jayaratha, in Kşema's text. This gains strength in view of Kşema's commentary on the subsequent verse (SV.T. 

10.433) and seems to have come in for criticism.

verse as quoted by Jayaratha and therefore we need not be confused by Kṣema's omission.' Jayaratha clearly implies that the correct text must have the additional half verse. Just on the contrary, Jaya- ratha does not have certain verses in the original text, though Kṣema has them. While commenting upon the Tantrāloka 8.73, Jayaratha quotes two verses in successions which correspond to the SV.T. 10.227 and 10.229 apparently omitting the Sv.T. 10.2284. In the aquatic category (Jala-tattva) Abhi- navagupta posits thirteen regions. Kṣemarāja's relative reading seems to have different implication unacceptable to Jayaratha. One may go deeper and

deeper. In Abhinavagupta's scheme of categories (Tattvayojana) everything other than Siva is to be deemed as bondage in nature and so all the nine powers from Vāmā to Manonmani in the re- gion of impure knowledge (Aśuddha-vidya) turn out to be binding in character. ' Jayaratha, as usual, traces the precise textual authority to back Abhi- navagupta's statement and also exploits the occasion to castigate Kṣemarāja. He not only has a different reading but finds Kşema's preference for male deitics to female ones as absurd, because those people are clumsy who talk of nine female powers instead of nine male deities simply because of textual reading." In the continuing context of categories Abhinava- gupta describes Sakti-category to be obscured by knowledge (Māna or Pramāṇa) and inhabited by the two Rudras namely Tejasvin and Dhruveśa.* According to Jayaratha, Abhinava has the sanction from the SV.T. and the Nandisikhatantra but dis-

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

agrees with Kṣemaraja's reading which places Pra- māṇa's obscurity just above Śakti and not at par.1 According to Abhinavagupta the region called Sādā- khya is the proper abode of Sadasiva and is covered or obscured by Śiva alone, while Kṣemarāja assigns Sadasiva-region just above Isvara and just below Sadasiva. Jayaratha charges Kṣemarāja with tam- pering with the original SV.T. by imaginary inter- polation of an half-verse which has been disregarded by the learned. Even if this addition be deemed to be genuine, argues Jayaratha, it does not vindicate Ksema's contention. It supports Abhinavagupta's stand instead, because the abode and the resident have the same level of subsistence. It is only on such a construction that the Nandiśikhatantra, too, may yield a consistent meaning. One, therefore, must guard himself against the misguiding interpretation offered by Kṣemarāja. It is indeed premature to

suspect whether Kṣemaraja and Jayaratha belonged to different preceptorial traditions or Jayaratha nur- sed some grouse against his senior Kṣemarāja in order to wrest the place of honour from him among the post-Abhinavan scholarship, yet what surprises the modern reader most is Jayaratha's going to the extreme of charging Kşema with deliberate distor- tions. As another instance of such aberrations Jaya- ratha, while explaining Abhinavagupta's views on the purification of deed (Karmasodhana) in respect of the spiritual apprentice called Śivadharmi1, invokes the authority of the SV.T. and propounds that once the process of fruition has commenced in respect of one particular deed it cannot be reversed so far as that deed is concerned. On the contrary, Kṣemarāja who talks of purifying even that deed which has commenced fruition is taken to task for tampering with the text, for going against the previous pro- nouncements and also for transgressing the scrip- tural injunctions." Jayaratha finds no end to it on

Kṣemaraja's part. In the course of Abhinava's dis- cussion on Śivahastavidhi' a spiritual apprentice is said to be transformed into a Samayin by his teacher's recourse to this method leading to a kind of intimate union (Sayujya) in Isvara category. Jayaratha finds fault with Kṣema's interpretation of the word Isvare as Kālāgnirudra existing below the category of earth and dubs it as lacking in scriptural testimony." 

(vi) Restoring tradition: fathoming inter se 

relationship among Agamas 

Jayaratha's critical zeal does not pause here. His abiding concern is to restore the real tradition. For this he checks up, over and above the already dis- cussed functions, inter se relationship between the Āgamas, substantiates arguments, peeps into the background to rationalize the item under consider- ation, underlines latent possibilities and may even advance suggestion for a proper appraisal. While discussing the variety of dissolution (Samharavaici- trya) in the sixth Ahnika he endorses Abhinava's view that Samana represents Pralaya stage and is identical with Sadasiva stage where the universe continues to exist in residual form. In this context

he quotes the views of a sub-group who thought Pralaya stage as being one with Siva stage.' He cri- ticises the view, reasons out his position and con- cludes that even when Samana is taken to be eternal, it does not dilute monism. Similarly he provides relevant contextual framework. While commenting upon the Tantrāloka 8.290 he notes that though the five gross elements succeed triple egoity in the SV.T., Abhinavagupta is discussing them as part of the sixteen modifications which lead to bondage. Any tantric system worth the name must discard the caste system. Hence the references to caste, according to Jayaratha's rationalization, must be construed as referring to the non-initiates or to the faithful of the lower grades. Moreover, Jayaratha provides a rich source of cultural information. It appears Dinars had come in vogue as a legal tender of currency in his time." It is from him that we learn that several varieties of wine were prevalent in his time and why they were distinguished. For instance Madya was produced

(e) AN EXCLUSIVE GUIDE TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

(i) Sevenfold assistance 

Jayaratha's contribution to the understanding of the Tantraloka is invaluable and indispensable. To begin with, Jayaratha provides connotative titles to all the Ahnikas. Though in most cases they reflect the clue provided by Abhinavagupta during the body of the text, it is he who offers captions. We shall dis- cuss this aspect at the appropriate occasion. In the second place he clearly demarcates the precise tex- tual portions dealing with general and ancillary to- pics, designated as Purvaja-and Anuja-uddeśas by Abhinavagupta. We shall look into it in the course of our discussion on the arrangement and organi- sation of the Tantraloka. In the third place, he ac- quaints us with the background view. For example he points out, notwithstanding Abhinava's silence, that in the ninth Ahnika his master wanted to criti- cise Tattva (category)-doctrine of the Bhogaka- rikā etc. (dualistic Saivism)". He not only leaves us at that but follows it up with the intermittent criti-

cism of Sankaranandana, Sadyojyoti, Devabala and Vaiseşikas1. Similarly he suggests that main target in the tenth Ahnika was to point out discrepancies in Nyaya and Bhāṭṭa Mimāmsā schools, though Abhinavagupta himself is once again silent on this point. In the fourth place, he fills in the omissions of Abhinavagupta. In the twentyeighth Ahnika, Abhinavagupta talks of 23 types of occasional func- tions (Naimittikavidhi). Jayaratha feels that a particular 'occasional' (Naimittika) called Śivarātri is also included in the quartet beginning with Vipat- pratikāra (T.A. 28.7), the reason behind omission being the universal treatment of this item in practi- cally all the scriptures. Similarly in Dutiyaga Abhi- navagupta talks of six varieties of Dutis e.g. consis- ting of Janyā, Janikā and Sahajā in twofold relation- ships-physical and cognitive, and invokes the autho- rity of the Sarvācāratantra. In a significant remark Jayaratha adds that there are several sub-varieties such as Vegavati, Samhāri, Trailokyakṣobhiņi etc.,

but a reference to the same has been avoided' for fear of endless recounting. In the fifth place, he allows us a peep into Abhinavagupta's own preferences and presuppositions. The case of Rudrakāli offers a good example. Rudrakāli, which marks the sev- enth stage in cyclic progression of consciousness in Anākhyācakra, has been equally named as Bhadra- kāli by the texts like Pañcaśatika etc., without any semantic distinction. Abhinavagupta, however, pre- fers the title Rudrakali-this piece of intimation we gather from Jayaratha". In the sixth place, one has to depend upon Jayaratha for a clear understanding of the esoteric implications of Abhinavagupta's treat- ment. For example, the textual portion dealing with the notion of virility of Mantra (Mantravirya)3 ap- parently has no esoteric semblances, yet Jayaratha finds that the first three verses deal with Parābija (the ultimate seed) and the subsequent three with five Pindanāthas. Similarly Abhinavagupta's des- cription of the six-fold movement of breath from the point of view of pervasion (Vyapti) is necessarily

from that of Mantravyapti.' As we have discussed in a different context earlier, Abhinavagupta's eso- tericism and symbolism is not at all understandable without Jayaratha's wholistic approach. The nature of Karanas which is spread over from 11th to 32nd Ahnikas as per declaration of Abhinavagupta himself is made known by Jayaratha alone by locating exact references. Thus the Karana of intelligence is dealt with in the eleventh (T.A. 11.21), of Vyapti in the fifteenth (T.A. 15.339), of knower- known combine in the sixteenth (T.A. 16.253), of imposition as well as that of rejection in the twenty- ninth (T.A. 29.147/182) and of absorption in the thirtysecond Ahnika (T.A. 32.10 onwards) by way of discussion on postures. No doubt Jayaratha is aware of the limit to which he may go. With regard to the filling of Arghapatra he advises one to learn. it from the mouth of a teacher, he has not touched it lest it might violate his school's code. But all the same he does not withhold any information he has. The word Diptaiḥ in depicting the nature of Mantra was open to two types of meaning and he

gives both. And in the case of divergent opinions about a thing, particularly if the authority of the Sripurvaśāstra was not readily handy on such eso- teric issues as Ekaviravidhāna,' he finally airs the view acceptable to him." In the seventh place, Jaya- ratha brings out the inherent argument of Abhi- navagupta-not only the substance but the form as well. Sometimes he builds up on the syllogistic form latent in Abhinavagupta's discussion and pre- sents the whole of it." 

(ii) Discharge of twin editrial obligations 

The greatest contribution of Jayaratha, however, lies in his role as the editor of the text of the Tan- trāloka. His handling of the Tantraloka's text is the logical extension of his approach to the handling of the tantric source material. It has two phases. One, when he subjects the text of the Tantraloka to rigorous criticism and undertakes to produce the standard version and two, when he critically looks into the arrangement and order of the verses in order to put a well organised text. Since we have already seen something of this in a different context, our job has become easier requiring a few samples. Jaya-

ratha prefers the reading Vyomãdisabda' in place of an equally good reading, i.e. Vyomadiṣatka. Even when he retains a particular reading3, as all the MSS available support it, he suggests a better reading." In Jayaratha's original copy of the Tantraloka the verse 3.220' possibly reads Matra (kundalinibijam) which has been rectified as Sātra ( - kundalini bijam) because such type of reading is not only non-agamic but even otherwise conveys incoherent meaning and involves improper diction. One may hold with re- asonable confidence that there were certain uncer- tainties about the text of the Tantraloka during the time of Jayaratha. It is why he sometimes suggests equally good alternative readings. Thus the printed text e.g., 

शिवदह्नकिरणजालैदाह्यत्वात् सा यतोऽन्यरूपैव 

may also be read as- 

विज्ञानामृतसरिता प्लाव्यत्वात् सा यतोऽन्यरूपैव 

(T.A. 9.207) 

To lend authenticity to his suggestions he cites the authority of the relative scripture (here Śivatanu- Sāstra). The Tantrāloka's actual text was often a

matter of doubt. Jayaratha did finalise his own ver- sion wherein he piled up several corrected readings. Displaying a rare scientific attitude he furnishes evi- dence behind his choice even at the slightest doubt. Thus the reading adopted by him in the T.A. 13.3551 was not due to his whim, he himself saw it in the old manuscripts not once or twice, but hundred times over. Similarly the text of the SV.T. (4.142), cor- responding to the T.A. 15.28, has slightly different reading in the version of Kşemarāja, target of bitter attack from Jayaratha for deliberate distortions. Jayaratha prefers to ignore the text of Kṣemarāja and preserves the original reading for the sake of propriety having culled support from Abhinava- gupta's statement in the Mrgendra. Even when the available reading is not defective, he assiduously gropes for a better reading. In the Tantraloka 15.80* he finds the word 'Yad' somewhat vague and pro- poses 'Tha' as a relatively lucid reading. Jayaratha's critical editing of the Tantraloka and his handling of the source texts has to be viewed together in a larger perspective so as to be able to evaluate his concerted effort towards keeping the text of the Tantrāloka free from imagination, interpolation and alien material and preserving its faithfulness to the original source literature.

His second editorial function relates to the organi- sation of the text. For example, the verse 'Jñana- hino' etc.,' (now numbered as T.A. 23.25 in the printed edition) was wrongly placed by certain scribes after the verse “Annadidāna” etc. (Ist half of the verse numbered as T.A. 23.23 in the printed edition) which is restored to its regular place by Jayaratha. It appears that Jayaratha is guided by the model hand- script on the basis of which he prepared his version of the Tantraloka. But even in his basic handscript there are certain places which have attracted edi- torial whetting. The verses as given in the footnote below appear twice in the body of the text as T.A. 37.4-5 and T.A. 37.11-13 (2nd half to 1st half ). Though Jayaratha retains the double mention, he clearly advises its precise placement and also rever- ses the order, besides offering tips for better read- ing. We come across a similar instance when he suggests that the first half of the T.A. 31.42 in all

propriety be placed before the T.A. 31.39 for ensur- ing coherent construction.1 Such instances bring his conscientious and ever vigilant self into bold relief. This, however, does not mean that he never suc- cumbs to general weaknesses of the scholars. He does, but very rarely. We find a glimpse of such a lapse in his interpretation of the word 'Anta" forming part of the compound in the T.A. 22.12. Here the use of the words 'Adi' and 'Anta' in the text obviously limits the options, but Jayaratha looks for an implied meaning convenient to him. But such far-fetched interpretations are very few and far between and in no way undermine his importance. 

(III) Methodology 

(a) GUIDING PRINCIPLES 

(i) Conformity to Abhinava, teacher and scripture Coming to the methodology employed and norms of writing adhered to by Jayaratha we notice that his first guiding principle in taking up an item is its absolute conformity which means it must conform in the first place to the stand of Abhinava-the ori- ginal author, in the second to the preceptorial stand and in the third to the scriptural view. All the three together, not severally, spell out his idea of adher- ence to the tradition. While discussing the notion of Karana (T.A. 5.130) he abstains from giving out everything at one place and in so doing leans on 

1. प्रायश्च अयं श्लोकः 'ततो रजांसि देयानि ......

Abhinavagupta's authority. Similarly, in final selec- tion out of several options it is the preceptorial injunction that must prevail. Moreover, he never ventures to rely on his imagination and propound a thing unless it is expressly enjoined in the Agamas.3 One of the reasons for rejecting the Uddyotakara's interpretation was his lack of scriptural endorse- ment. Same is the case with those who propound a different reading from one picked up by him." To him the teaming up of all the three authorities, speci- ally teacher and scripture, is very sacred. Hence, he rejects the alternative readings and resulting explan- ations since they digress from the authority of the scriptural text and the teacher." 

(ii) Thoroughness and authenticity; and (iii) Absence of fascination for word-by-word comentary: eight key factors 

Thoroughness and authenticity, thus, are the twin criteria that he ardently pursues but they do not come in the way of his concise and systematic presen- tation. That is why he never revels in word-by-word explanation. His staying away, however, from the

verbatim commentary is not arbitrary. He is guided. by certain norms which he has set for himself. (i) Obvious clarity, (ii) future treatment, (iii) overde- tailed discussions are some of the considerations that prevent him from embarking upon word-by-word commentary.' (iv) Fear of unnecessary repetition is another factor which he is very much scared of." If the item is of esoteric importance, frequent repe- tion might cause leakage, or if it is of general impor- tance and has been occasionally discussed, too much repetion will amount to wastage of effort. To the list of his norms he adds two more (v) relevance or utility and (vi) propriety, which constitute the hall- mark of his style characterised by his disdain for (vii) far-fetched imagination and (viii) breach of tra- dition. Undue extension of the text and irrelevance, however, are the twin factors that frighten him most. He refrains from gathering all the possible inter- pretations because of these two factors. The same consideration does not allow him to enumerate all the aspects associated with each movement of breath (Cara) or the total number of days associated 1. इत्येतदस्माभिः स्पष्टत्वात्, ग्रन्थविस्तरभयात्, अग्रे च निर्णेष्यमाणत्वात् न प्रातिपद्येन व्याख्यातम् ।

with the residents of the five sheaths.1 Even when he is dwelling upon certain source text, he only picks up the relevant material from here and there insted of reproducing the whole text. The idea behind the whole exercise is that the quoted text must be rele- vant to the issue under discussion, and at the same time should not make the work bulkier. 

3 

(iv) Fear of undue extension and deviation from 

the original line 

The notion of relevance is intertwined with the notion of propriety. Relevance minus propriety does not sound convincing. He, therefore, derives stre- ngth from his concern for propriety while he sticks to relevance. At one place, he openly admits it. 4 He remains faithful to this principle throughout and does not counter all the anomalies even when he notices them in the available account of a tradi- tion. One should not, therefore, consider it a defect if Jayaratha does not explain or cite every word of the text. In such an approach, as mentioned earlier,

he derives additional strength from his disdain for laboured use of imagination1 and his almost reli- gious concern for retention of the tradition intact." Obviously it does not mean that he leaves the por- tions unexplained. Instead, he believes in explain- ing a thing thoroughly even by supplying/importing a missing word on his own in the interest of consist- ency. There are several instances that illustrate it.3 Usually, he first attempts an explanation of words and then gives out essence or gist of Kārikā in his own words. In the case of doubt or necessity to furnish additional explanation he offers alternative expla- nations and tries to reconcile various ends if there is difference of opinion or confusion-whether deli- berate or accidental.

of it earlier we leave the matters here. He, however, continues to remain unswerving in his commitment to bring out the essence of Abhinavagupta's work,1 and wherever he leaves out something, the scholars are expected to treat it as unnecessary. 

(b) DIFFERENCES FROM ABHINAVA & DEVIATION FROM THE 

ORIGINAL LINE 

We, thus, see that Jayaratha is extremely faithful to Abhinavagupta and tradition, but he is not a blind follower at all. A person of his calibre and compe- tence can never be. There are occasions, notwith- standing their rarity, when he does not endorse Abhi- navagupta's reading or finds the latter's version want- ing in certain respects. For example, he raises his finger at the use of word 'Padmagam' by Abhinava- gupta. He once again questions Abhinavagupta's reading and suggests a better one. Similarly, when Abhinavagupta embarks upon consideration of vari- ous stations or seats (Pithas) from the T.A. 15.83 to 15.97 on the authority of the Nisisañcara Agama, Jaya- ratha invites attention of the reader to the portion from the T.A. 15.86 to 15.88* and finds the first half of the T.A. 15.86 not only contradictory to the conclusion

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

contained in the second half of the T.A. 15.88 but also devoid of agamic support and therefore asks the reader to simply ignore it.' We have already seen in detail how much new material has been introduced by Jayaratha to make the Tantraloka more under- standable and uptodate but never has he deviated from the main stream. The matter thus introduced is invariably either colateral or complementary in nature. But Jayaratha, for once, has deviated from the original line and may not be called so faithful in spite of his resorting to the usual commentatorial gimmic. One of the nine main topics incorporated under Krama system is 'non-utility or irrelevance of the limbs of Yoga' (Yogangānupayogitva). The Yoga which Abhinavagupta seeks to refer to is the eight-limbed Yoga of Patanjali, nowhere alluding to the Sadanga (six-limbed) Yoga at all. Jayaratha, however, takes Sadanga, and not Aṣṭanga, as actu- ally belonging to Krama system (Svadarśanoktāni). Then why does Abhinavagupta refer to Patanjali's Yoga? The logic behind Abhinavagupta's enumer- ation, according to Jayaratha, is that though the

former subscribes to Sadanga theory, he wants to convey the upper limit of the number of the yogic limbs.1 However, Jayaratha's deviation is too trans- parent to fool anybody. Why does he do so? There may be two possible reasons. Either he is under the spell of Buddhist tantricists who propogated the six- limbed Yoga and is out to wean the people away from them to his path or he inherits a Krama tradi- tion different from Abhinavagupta's which enjoined Şadanga Yoga. It is interesting to note that Jaya- ratha nowhere tries to define the six limbs and quotes an unidentified source only once to enumerate them." Although it is an interesting episode of Krama his- tory we do not intend to pursue it further because our interest is limited to exploring the inter se rela- tionship between Jayaratha and his master.3

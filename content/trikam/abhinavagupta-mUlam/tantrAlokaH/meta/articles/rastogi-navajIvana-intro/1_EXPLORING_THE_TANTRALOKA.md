Strange as it may appear, the Tantrāloka happens to be the only major 'original' work of Abhinava while his all other important works[^1-1] come to us in the form of a commentary on some earlier valuable text notwithstanding his own description of the Tantrāloka as a gloss, as we shall see in the sequel. 

## 1 Traditional Approach to the Tantrāloka 

A peep into and a look around the Tantrāloka off- ers many illuminating insights. Towards twelfth century Śivānanda, the author of the R̥juvimarśinī, refers to it as the Trika-śāstra[^1-2] or Trika-saraśāstra[^1-3] and the verses cited are traceable to the published edition of the Tantrāloka. It, therefore, appears that by that time it came to be regarded as the most representative text of Trika system. Kṣemarāja, the illustrious pupil of Abhinavagupta, talks of two characteristics of the text. One, it was composed in the state of Absolutic trance[^1-4]

[^1-1]: Abhinava's other major works include A.Bh. (Comm. on the N.S.), I.P.V (Comm. on I.P.K.), I.P.V.V. (Comm. on the I.P.K.V.) and Locana (Comm. on the Dh. L.).

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

and other, it is a key to the secrets of entire agamic literature.[^2-1] In the Tantrasāra, Abhinavagupta invariably describes the Tantrāloka as a detailed treatise and asks the author to turn for detailed discussion of the problem to the latter which incorporates all the prescriptive and negative injunctions emanating not only from Vedic but from Saiva, Tantra and Trika sources also.[^2-2] The view has been consistently hammered again and again.[^2-3] According to the Tantrasāra, the Tantrāloka was not only a repository of agamic lore but a critical text which minutely recorded even internal and mutual divergences.[^2-4] Thus the image of the Tantrāloka as a single, extra-comprehensive and authoritative source book appears to have been projected by Abhinavagupta himself. The central theme of the Tantrāloka, according to Abhinavagupta in his Locana[^2-5], however revolves round the transcendental Absolutic reality called Brahman (i.e. Anuttara).

EXPLORING THE TANTRĀLOKA 

[[3]] 

The prime concern of the Tantrāloka was to explain, to unfold and to explore. It therefore assumed the form of a gloss, or a commentary and was therefore termed as the Vārtika[^3-1] (gloss), Śloka-vārtika (versified gloss) [^3-2] and Ṣaḍardha-ślokavārtika (versified gloss on Trika system) [^3-3]. Possibly in designating the Tantrāloka as Vārtika, Abhinavagupta was inspired by Katyayana's example in whose case Vārtika is defined as "an explanatory or supplementary rule which explains the meaning of that which is said, of that which is left unsaid, and of that which is imperfectly said."[^3-4] This amply applies to the Tantrāloka as we shall have occasion to see later. Elsewhere in a very significant remark Abhinavagupta describes the Tantrāloka as a mix of all the varieties (e.g. brief, regular and large) of glossarial work based on Āgamas. Thus it is a Vārtika, a Bhāṣya and a Vṛtti all at

2. अन्वर्थं चात्र दर्शितं तन्त्रालोके श्लोकवार्तिके च । The use of 'ca' is very ambiguous and may lead one to conclude that the Tantrāloka and Ślokavārtika were two independent texts (vide K.T., p. 159). But in view of the overwhelming collateral textual evidence as produced above and non-discovery of any text by the name of the Ślokavārtika (pertaining to K.S.) so far it seems appropriate to identify the two. My earlier view on this stands modified (vide K.T., p. 159). In such a situation the text is to be construed as under-

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

a time.1 It is perhaps the reason why Abhinava's in- terpretations-cum-explanations on specific issues in the Tantrāloka are recalled as testimony. The Tan- trāloka was also known as Tantravaloka. 

(ii) Four motives behind the composition 

(a) SAMGRAHA-GRANTHA 

Abhinavagupta composed the Tantrāloka from several angles. Obviously the first and the most strik- ing intention of his is to present a digest of the avail- able tantric literature and lore. Technically, there- fore, the Tantrāloka is a compendium (Samgraha-gran- tha)". In creating a compendium Abhinavagupta's primary objective seems to handle not only the Trika material alone in its tantric sources, but the non-Trika material in its agamic sources as well." Abhinava- gupta himself sets at rest all conjectures in this re- gard. His avowed intention is to introduce all the agamic material in its varied sources". Abhinava- gupta has been, therefore, quite appropriately hailed

as Samgrahakāra' and the Tantrāloka as the Sam- graha by Jayaratha. 

(b) PRAKRIYA OR PADDHATI GRANTHA 

Abhinavagupta's second, but rather more signifi- cant, intention is to produce a Prakriya or Paddhati, perhaps employed as interchangeable terms in the context. Abhinavagupta was perturbed over the fact that there was no Paddhati text in his source-system, i.e. the system of transcendental triad (Anuttara-şada- rdharthakrama), although there were plenty of them in other source systems. In order to overcome this drawback he decided to write the present Prakriyā i.e., Tantrāloka, complete in all respects. Abhinava- gupta and Jayaratha both do not give any clue to Abhinavagupta's concept of a Prakriya-grantha, al- though Jayaratha is full of references to Abhinava- gupta's professed aim to undertake a Prakriyāgran- tha. In this context one comes across four observa- tions: 

(i) The Prakriya under reference namely, the Tantrāloka, is totally based on the M.V.T;" 

Jayaratha's introductory observation preceding the above verse is very suggestive-

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRALOKA 

(ii) There were two Prakriyas within the monistic fold namely, Kula-prakriya and Tantra-pra- 

kriyā; 

(iii) Kula Prakriya is superior of the two;1 and 

both together represent Trikaprakriyā; (iv) A sizable section of the learned scholars sub- scribing to the system but not possessing un- interrupted tradition required a guide in res- pect of the matters they did not know. The Tantrāloka's composition as Prakriya was a significant step towards fulfilling this desi- deratum." 

Now let us see what the Tantrāloka as a Prakriyā text means. If we compare the T.A. 1.14 and 1.15, we find that Prakriya and Paddhati denote the same thing. Another thing to be noted is that both terms stand for a particular class of books. Naturally the grammarian's usage of Prakriya in the sense of an etymological work does not fit in here. The Vacas- patyam includes among its meanings a chapter or a section (Prakarana) which lays down an order and the Sabdakalpadruma interprets it as a "definite pro- cedure" (Niyatavidhi). Similarly, Paddhati is taken to stand for a treatise that brings out the gist or the

essential meaning. The Vacaspatyam and Sabdakal- padruma, both lexicons agree and both cite Hema- candra in support. Thus we see that according to these lexicographers a Prakriya text constitutes a work or a section thereof composed to convey the essential purport of the subject and to lay bare the procedure, if any, involved in realizing the primary purpose. A close examination of Abhinava will re- veal that his concept of the Prakriya or Paddhati was closer to the above definition. 

Abhinava refers to the P.T.V. as Anuttaraprakriyā.“ It will simply amount to saying that the P.T.V. was also a Prakriya-grantha." Abhinava's use of the word Prakriya elsewhere reminds one of something relat- 

1. पन्थस्य निष्कृष्टार्थबोधके ग्रन्थभेदे (हेमचन्द्रः) । 

Vacaspatyam, Vol. V, p. 4225 2. " ग्रन्थार्थबोधकग्रन्थः" इति हेमचंद्रः । 

Sabdakalpadruma, Part III, p. 40 3. Hemacandra's observations as per footnotes above assume significance because Hemacandra was quite close to Abhinava chronologically a gap of a century obtained between the two- and was in know of Abhinava's works as his treatment of Rasa in the Kāvyānusśāsana betrays unmistakeable impact of Abhinava's Abhinavabharati. 

4. अनुत्तरप्रक्रियायां वैतत्येन प्रदर्शितम् । 

T.A. 9.313 

5. A question may naturally arise as to whether there were two Prakriyas on Anuttaratrika System, because as Abhinava has already said, that (vide Fn. 3, p.5 supra) there were no Prakriya texts or Paddhatis on his system. The answer perhaps lies in the fact that, as we shall see later, the P.T.V., M.V.V. and T.A. constitute one whole and as such may be part of a larger textual framework. 

6. तत्त्राध्वैवं निरूप्योऽयं यतस्तत्प्रक्रियाक्रमम् ।

ing to practice or Sadhana. The idea becomes clearer when Abhinava concludes that in the SV.T. know- ledge does not involve action or practice.' Jayaratha leaves no doubt that the mutual difference between the several Tantras, even though sometimes belonging to the same sect, stems from the practices enjoined." This leaves us in no doubt that Prakriya must have meant a special practice-intra- and trans-ritualistic both and the text that lays down the relative code is a Prakriya-grantha. The other term used in this context by Abhinava is Paddhati, as we all know. What was his model we do not know. However he refers to one Paddhati by Iśānasiva which clearly brought out the essential procedure as laid down in the famous Krama Agama Devyāyāmala. This Isana- siva is, no doubt, different from his namesake author of the Gurudevapaddhati or Tantrapaddhati and who definitely flourished after 1073 A.D. and was, accord- ing to Dwivedi, identical with the great-grand tea- 

1. 

न प्रक्रियापरं ज्ञानमिति स्वच्छन्दशासने । 

TA., 8.11; Jayaratha adds यदुक्तं तत्र "नास्ति दीक्षासमो मोक्षो न विद्या मातृका परा । 

2. 

न प्रक्रियापरं ज्ञानं नास्ति योगस्त्वलक्षकः ॥” (SV. T. 11.198) इह् (त्रिशिरोभैरवे) च अनन्तस्य श्रीसिद्धातन्त्रोक्तं भुवनमानं न ग्राह्यमेव "क्रियादिभेदभेदेन तन्त्रभेदो यतः स्मृतः ।

T.A.V., V, p. 16 

T.A. 22.30-31 

Jayaratha's interpretation of the term Abhyupaya removes the 

last tinge of difference between Paddhati and Prakriya-

cher of Somasambhu, the author of the Karmakāṇḍa- kramāvali. Dharmasiva, a teacher of Abhinava-if we go by the authority of Kṣemaraja-also wrote one Paddhati which had the 'indirect initiation' as its central theme and it is which has been referred to by Abhinava, though not by name. These are possi- bly the Paddhatis whose presence led Abhinava to lament the absence of one in his own system. The Siddha-siddhanta-paddhati, the famous text of Natha cult, which is much later, a text full of references to Pratyabhijñā system, similarly seems to be a work in Paddhati tradition. Dwivedi refers to several Pad- dhatis such as the Udayakarapaddhati and Varuna Paddhati and Maheśvarananda in his M.M.P. refers to one Mahanayapaddhati. It may be, therefore, quite logical to conclude that the Tantrāloka was a text in Paddhati or Prakriya tradition and was com- posed as a complete manual for the adherents of the Trika way of life. 

(c) SASTRA GRANTHA 

The third intention of Abhinava was to project the Tantrāloka as a full-fledged Sastra (scripture) or Sās- ana.' As such it turned out to be a Prakriya Sastra

(manualistic scripture), to be precise.' It is why Jaya- ratha frequently remembers Abhinava as Sastrakāra.2 Jayaratha, while summing up the initial sentence (Adivākya i.e., T.A. 1.1 to 1.21) tries to highlight the formal Śastric character of the Tantrāloka as under- 

(i) T.A. 1.1 to 1.5 - अभिधेयम् = त्रिकार्थः (it is manifold). (ii) T.A. 1.16 to 1.20 - (a) प्रयोजनम् - त्रिकार्थस्य सातिशयत्वम् 

(b) मुख्य प्रयोजनम् = प्रत्यभिज्ञानाद् जीवन्मुक्तिप्रदत्वम् 

(iii) T.A. 1.7 to 1.13 – अधिकारः = गुरूपरम्परोपात्तत्वम् 

परमेश्वरशक्तिपातपवित्रितत्वं च 

(iv) T. A. 1.14 to 1.15 संबंध : - (a) वाच्य वाचकभाव: ( वाच्य & 1.2451 

is प्रक्रिया and वाचक is तंत्रालोक). 

1. "अर्थितो रचये" (१.१५) इति प्रतिज्ञायाः प्रक्रियायाश्च "तन्मया तन्त्र- यते तन्त्रालोकनामन्यत्र शासने (१.२४५) इत्यादिवक्ष्यमाणोपजीवनेन तन्त्रालोक इत्यभिधानम् ।

3. Abhinava defines Adhikarin in T.A. 1.337 eloquently- 

इह गलितमलाः परावरज्ञाः शिवसद्भावमया अधिक्रियन्ते । गुरवः प्रविचारणे यतस्तद् विफला द्वेषकलंकहानियाञ्चा ॥ 

The same may well be compared with the second concluding verse of the Viveka- 

योऽधीती निखिलागमेषु पदविद् यो योगशास्त्रश्रमी यो वाक्यार्थसमन्वये कृतरतिः श्रीप्रत्यभिज्ञामृते । यस्तर्कान्तरविश्रुतश्रुततया द्वैताद्वयाज्ञानवित् सोऽस्मिन्स्यादधिकारवान् कलकलप्रायं परेषां वचः ।। 

(T.A.V., XII, p. 428) 

Abhinava makes it abundantly clear that such a 'competent' per- son is difficult to locate- 

तत्र तत्र च शास्त्रेषु न्यरूप्यत महेशिना । एतावत्यधिकारी यः स दुर्लभ इति स्फुटम् ॥ 

T.A. 35.43

(b) अभिधेयप्रयोजनयोः साध्यसाधनभावः ( साध्य is अनुत्तरत्रिकज्ञप्ति and साधन is तंत्रा लोकोक्त उपायचतुष्टय or प्रक्रिया ) . (v) T.A. 1.6 – उपलब्धौ संभव विघ्ननिरासाय गणेशवटुकयोः स्तुतिः ' 

(d) STUTI GRANTHA 

The fourth and the final approach consists in Abhi- nava's contemplation of the Tanraloka as a full scale Stuti (prayer hymn). In the concluding part of the initial sentence2 as well as in the ultimate verse3 Abhi- nava leaves no ambiguity about his intention. When- ever he gets an opportunity he grabs the occassion to project the devotional theme of the Tantrāloka. In his eyes the entire subject matter of the Tantrāloka acquires meaning when it leads one to attain Śiva- hood owing to His grace alone. The Tantrāloka out- lines the path and procedure to invoke such divine grace and once it is attained the clouds of nescient doubts disappear and one shines in one's pristine splendour. Such an approach lends credence to the views of many a modern scholar who takes Kashmir Saivism as theology or transcendental theology hop- ing to reach and realize the personalistic Godhead and not as a pure metaphysics concentrating on an

abstract Absolute. It is only from this deep religious point of view that the Prakriya character of the Tan- trāloka can be more meaningfully explained. Possi- bly this is the significance of this view being vouched in the beginning and in the end (Uparkrama and Upasaṁhāra, to put it traditionally) of the Tantrāloka. 

(iii) Five objectives behind the composition of the Tantrāloka 

(a-i) ATTAINMENT OF BHAIRAVAHOOD 

After examination of the underlying motives of Abhinava a study of Abhinava's objectives behind his composition of the Tantrāloka will be immensely helpful. The fundamental aim is the same as that of his philosophical discipline in general. It is the achie- vement of Bhairavahood i.e., the divination of the mundane. Abhinava proudly declares that one who constantly practises all the tenets of thirtyseven Ah- nikas is oneself transformed into Bhairava, the Abso- lute. If a consistent perusal of 37 chapters leads to one's attainment of essential divinity, it is all the more reason to conclude that the microscopically finite being is capable of attaining cosmic personality. 

(a-ii) PROPOUNDING FOURFOLD REDEMTIVE KNOWLEDGE 

Abhinava is never tired of reiterating his preferences. He says that the original commitment of the Tantrāloka is to understand the nature of Absolute Awareness2. 

1. इति सप्ताधिकामेनां विशतं यः सदा बुधः । 

आह्निकानां समभ्यस्येत्स साक्षाद् भैरवो भवेत् ॥ सप्तविंशत्सु संपूर्ण बोधो यभैरवो भवेत् ।

T.A. 1. 284-86 

Ibid. 2.1 

EXPLORING THE TANTRĀLOKA 

13 

The four varieties of redemptive knowledge, as discus- sed in the Tantrāloka, are primarily designed to master both the worldly accomplishment and the spiritual transcendence.1 While making a passing reference in his Locana, as we had occasion to note earlier, Abhinava finds the transcendental Godhead as occupying the central focus of the Tantrāloka. It is descent of His 

3 

grace (Saktipāta) that alone constitutes the driving force for the aspirant's movements and it is why the problems of bondage and emancipation assume a kind of primacy over other issues. Abhinava goes on positing that the basic purpose of the Tantrāloka is inculcation of the 'intuitive awareness" (Pratibha - samvitti) which once thoroughly inculcated trans- forms the discursive perspective of mankind into the unitive one. Abhinava (and his commentator Jaya- ratha also) refutes the charge of being arrogant in self-eulogy, as to him it is just a statement of facts."

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

(b) PRESENTING THE ULTIMATE TEXTUAL AUTHORITY 

This brings us to another objective of Abhinava in presenting the Tantrāloka as the ultimate textual au- thority. Self-realization is the goal of all spiritual dis- ciplines and the standard effective tool conceived by them is the power of the Godhead. No other text has been able to drive this truth home more than the Tantrāloka and the reason for it lay in Abhinava's taking recourse to his own discerning judgement, un- failing sense of right logic, vast command over Saivis- tic scriptures and above all his deep insight into Trika ideology, in that order.' All these combined together lent enormous width and intense depth to Abhinava's treatment. Knowledge in order to earn transcendence has to pass through three successive stages: 

(i) it must emanate from a scripture; 

(ii) it must be thoroughly investigated under a 

knowledgeable guide; and 

(iii) it must ultimately form basic core of one's 

experience.2 

Jayaratha throws a veiled hint that Abhinava's intellectual/spiritual equipment very much betrayed such a wholistic framework of mind. Under such circumstances the Tantrāloka could not but become the most ideal, complete and reliable textual autho-

3. While commenting on T.A. 7.1 ( इति कालतत्त्वमृदितं शास्त्रमुखा- गमनिजानुभवसिद्धम् ) Jayaratha explains सिद्धम् as “यतः शास्त्र- क्रमात् भं रवायते ।।” इत्याद्युक्त्या पारिपूर्णेन लब्धसिद्धिरिति (सिद्धीति ? ) शिवम् ।

rity. We are, therefore, tempted to suggest that three- fold epistemic methodology consisting of verbal testi- mony, reasoning and perception (āgama, Yukti and Pratyakṣa) emerged from the triple sources of agamic understanding--scripture, guide and self. 

(c) EASY COMPREHENSION OF THE TANTRIC WISDOM 

Easy comprehension of the tantric wisdom was the third objective of Abhinava.' It was from this point of view that he concentrated mainly on those issues or opinions which would be useful for all. Not that he shunned controversial issues rather, on the con- trary, he took them up in his other works for a specia- list's treatment. 2 

(d) RESTORATION AND PRESERVATION OF THE TRADITION 

A careful look into the Tantrāloka brings out one more objective which is however treated by Abhinava in a low key. His three references, one (Sampradāyo- jjhitaih) in the beginning and two others (Vidam- bitāh and Bhraşte Viddhau") in the middle of the Tantrāloka are quite conspicuous by their mention.

INTRODUCTION TO THE TANTRĀLOKA 

In the first, Abhinava seems to suggest that there were people who, though learned, were deprived of the uninterrupted tradition and hence did not have access to the doctrinal secrets. In the second, he hints at the existence of the people who were neither conversant with the text nor had waited upon the teacher for guidance. As such, being easily misled by the simi- larity of expression, they showed considerable gap in their knowledge. In the third, he implies that in certain sections the traditional secrets or specific procedures were lost or corrupted beyond recognition. In the first and second case, he undertook to propound the traditional wisdom inherited by him and in the third, he enjoins alternative course to be followed by taking recourse to the assignment (Nyasa) called Malini. Jayaratha's observation, that whenever Abhinava quotes an agamic authority and recites a particular reading he does so to remove any misgivings about that source,1 further strengthens the above premises. The foregoing discussion leads us to conclude that one of the undeclared objectives of Abhinava is to restore and preserve the existing and traditionally acquired tantric literature and practices. We will have to say something on this aspect again while examining his style and method. 

From the above noted account we note that Abhi- nava's motives and objectives could be classified into two groups i.e., the one declared and the other un- declared, and may be briefed as under:

PREFACE  

Vijiiinabhairava is a very ancient book on Yoga. It closely  follows the basic principles of Saivigama. It contains 112 type.s  of yoga. There is hardly any other book on yoga which has  described so many ways of approach to Central Reality that is  present in each man as his essential Self. It is both extensive, ~nd  

intensive in the treatment of the subject of yoga.  

An English translation of this excellent work is being provided  for the first time. The text that has been adopted is mainly  the one that is published ill the Kashmir Series of Texts and  Studies. At a few places, however, slightly different readings  yielding better sense have been incorporated as suggested by  Svimi Lak~maQa Joo.  

Each verse of the Sanskrit text has been printed in both  Devanigari and Roman script. This is followed by an English  translation and a number of expository notes which will go a  long way in elucidating the main idea of the verse.  

A long Introduction explaining the basic principles of the  yogas described in the text has been provided in the beginning.  A glossary of technical terms has also been added at the end.  

Since the yogas recommended in the book are based on the  tenets of the non-dualistic Saiva Philosophy, the reader will do  well to read the author's Introductory Portion of either the  Pratyabhijiiihrda~am or the Siva-sutras before taking up the  study of the present book.  

I express my sincerest gratitude to Svimi Lak:?maoa Joo  who has kindly taught this book to me word by word. My  thanks are also due to Shri Dinanath Ganj who has kindly  helped me in the preparation of the index to important  Sanskrit words and the alphabetical index to the verses.

I. VI. 79 JAIDEVA SINGHINTRODUCTION  

IMPORTANCE OF VIJ~ANABHAIRAVA  

There have been, in India, two main ways of approach to  Reality or the Essential Nature of Self, viz., Vivekaja marga and  Yogaja marga-the path of distinction or discrimination and  the path of union or integration. Pataojala yoga and Sankara  Vedanta have adopted the Vivekaja marga by which the Puru~a  or Atma (the Self) is isolated from Prakrti (in the case of  Pataojala Yoga) or from Maya (in the case of Vedanta). The  word Yoga does not mean union in Pataojali's system; it means  samadhi or intense abstract meditation (as Vyasa puts it in his  commentary, 'yuji samadhau'). Saivagama has adopted the  Yogaja marga in which the goal is not isolation of the Self from  Prakrti or Maya but the integration of the individual Self to the  Universal Self or Bhairava and the realization of the universe as  the expression of His Sakti or spiritual Energy. The ideal of  Saivagama is not the rejection of the universe but its assimilation  to its Source.  

Vijiianabhairava is an excellent exposition of the yogaja miirga.  Hence its importance. It has been referred to as Agama:  Sivavijiianopani~d,1 and Rudrayamalasara3 by Abhinavagupta.  Yogaraja has referred to it as Saivopani~ad.' K~emaraja has  referred to it at many places in his commentary on Siva-sutras.  

It is clear that it has been acknowledged by the great expon,  ents of Saivagama as a very authentic work on yoga.  

THE TEXT  

Vijiianabhairava has been published in the Kashmir  Series of Texts and Studies with an incomplete commentary of  K~maraja, and complete commentaries of Sivopadhyaya and  Bhana Ananda.  

In the above text, the following remark appears on page 16,  'after the 23rd verse, "ita uttararil Sri Sivopadhyay~krti vivrtib"  

1. I.P.V.V.I, p. 207. 2.I.P.V.V. II, p. 405. 3. I.P.V.V., p. 28~·  4. V;lIrll ParllNldrl/rQ..sdra. 

Vijiianabha;rava  

i.e. "after this, the commentary is by Sivopadhyaya. "Even in  the life-time of Sivopadhyaya, the full commentary of K~emaraja  was not available. It is not known whether K~emaraja did not  live to complete his commentary, or whether his commentary after  the above verse has been lost. All that can be said is that it has  not been so far traced."  

Sivopadhyaya is greatly influenced by SaQlkara Vedanta. So  his commentary is not reliable. BhaHa Ananda is even more  avowedly a follower of SaQlkara Vedanta. His commentary is,  therefore, even far more removed from the original intention of  the text. In the preparation of the present edition, these com 

mentaries have not been translated.  

THE DATE OF V1J:fiIANABHAIRAV A AND THE  COMMENTARIES  

Vijiiiinabhairava is a part of the ancient Tantras. It is held in  high esteem in Saivagama. Abhinavagupta calls it Siva-vijiiana 

upani~ad.  

The text of Vijiianabhairava claims to be the quintessence of  Rudrayamala Tantra which means union of Rudra with His  Sakti (Spiritual Energy). The authentic text of Rudrayamala  Tantra is not available. So it is not possible to say how far the  text of Vijiianabhairava corresponds to that of Rudrayamala  Tantra.  

Tantras contain descriptions ot'ritual practices, sacred formulae  (mantras). mystical diagrams (yantras), gestures (mudriis),  postures (asallas), initiations (dlkia), yoga or mystic practices.  Vijiiiinabhairava is purely a manual of mystic practices in  accordance with Saivagama.  

In the present state of our knowledge, it is impossible to give  the exact datc of Vijiianabhairava. The earliest reference to it is  found in Viimananiith's Advayasampatti-varttika. It is likely that  Vamananatha may be the same as Vamana, the celebrated writer  on Poetics who flourished during the reign of King Jayapida of  Ka~h1l1ir (779---813 A.D.) If that be so, then it can be easily said  that Vijiianabhairava wa~ very well known in the 8th century  -\.D. Perhaps. it may have been compiled a century earlier. 

Introduction xi  

So far as the commentators are concerned, K~emaraja ftour ished in the 10th century A.D. In the colophon of his com mentary, Bhatta Ananda mentions the date of the completion  of the commentary according to which he flourished in the 17th  century A.D.  

Sivopadhyaya says in the colophon of his commentary that  it was finished during the reign of Sukhajivana. This means that  he flourished in the 18th century A.D.  

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF VUNANABHAIRA VA  

VijiiaDabhairava consists of two words, vijiiiina and bhairava.  We have first of aU to understand the esoteric significance of  Bhairava. K~emaraja in his Udyota commentary gives a descrip tion of the esoteric meaning of Bhairava. The SUID and substance  of it is that Bhairava is an acrostic word consisting of the letters,  bha, ra, and va; bha indicates bhara!)a or maintenance of the  universe; ra indicates rava!)a or withdrawal of the universe;  l'a indicates vamana or projection Le., manifestation of the  universe. Thus BhairdVd indicates all the three aspects of the  Divine.  

This has been clarified by Abhinavagupta in Tantraloka JII,  verses 283-285 in which he describes the three aspects of the  Divine as sra~/ii (manifester of tile universe), v;svarupatii, Bhairava  in His cosmic essence in whose consciousness the entire universe  differentiated in six ways (~adadhvii) is reflected. and Bhairava  as prasama in whose ftame of mahiiboclha (universal conscious 

ness), everything is dissolved.  

While Bhairava has three altpects, He from the point of view  of the mystic, is that Ultimate Reality in which prakusa i.e.  Light of Consciousness and vimarśa or Eternal Awareness or  that Light are indistinguishably fused. In other words, Bhairava  is parama Siva in whom prakiisa and vimarśa, Sil'a and Sakti,  Bhairava and Bhairal'; are identical. Bhairava or Parama Siva  embraces in Himself transcendence Hnd immanence, Siva and  8akti. It is this Bhairava that is the goal of the seeker.  

The svarupa or eltsential nature of Bhairava is vij;;una or bodha  or mahubodha, cit or cailanya the main characleristic of which  is svutanlrya or absolute freedom revealing itself in icc:hii, j;;una, 

xii Vijiidnabhairava  

and kriya. It is to this Vijiianabhairava that the seeker of  spiritual life has to be integrated.  

The entire manifestation consisting of subject and object is a  mere reflection in this vijRana. Just as a city in a mirror appears  as something different from the mirror, though it is nothing  different from the mirror, even so the universe though appearing  different from vijRana is nothing different from it.  

In verses 2 to 6 of VijRanabhairava, the Devl mentions certain  well known statements about Bhairava and wants to know His  paravastha-highest state or essential nature. Bhairava categori cally rejects the various well known opinions about His highest  state and pithily but with luminous clarity states in verses 14 and  I 5 what His essential nature consists in :  

"Paravastha (the highest state) of Bhairava is free of all  notions pertaining to direction (dik), time (Kiila), nor can that be  particularized, by some definite space (deJa) or designation  (uddeia). In verity that can neither be indicated nor described in  words. One can be aware of that only when one is completely  free of all thought-constructs (vika/pas). One can have an  experience of that bliss in his own inmost Self (when one is  completely rid of the ego, and is established in purl',lahanta i.e.  in the plenitude of the divine I-consciousness).  

That state of Bhairava which is full of the bliss of non-difference  from the entire world (bharitakira) is alone Bha;ravl or SakI; of  Bhairava."  

That state is VijRana-a state of consciousness which is  n;rvika/pa, free of all thought-constructs. This Vijiiinabhairava  is the goal of man.  

Paradevi or Bhairavi is only the Sakli (Power or energy) of  Bhairava. Just as there is no difference between fire and its  power of burning, even so there is no difference between  Bhairava and Paridevi. Paridevi has been called SaM mukha  or means of approach to Siva.  

DHARA~AS OR YOGA PRACTICES  

The Devi now ~nqujres, "By what means can this highest state  be realized 1" In reply to this, Bhairava describes 112 dhilrQ(liis. 

Introduction xiii  

In Pataiijali, the word dharaIJii is used in a somewhat limited  sense viz; 'fixation of mind on a particular spot.' In Vijiianabhai rava it is used in the wide sense of fixation or concentration of  mind or yoga. The word yoga is used both in the sense of comm union (with the Divine) and the means (upiiya) for that commu nion. So 112 types of yoga or means of communion with  Bhairava have been described in this text. .  

Unfortunately, no word has been profaned so much in modern  times as yoga. Fire-walking, acid-swallowing, stopping the heart beat, etc. pass for yoga when really speaking they have nothing  to do with yoga as such. Even psychic powers are not yoga.  Yoga is awareness, transformation of the human consciousness  into divine consciousness.  

Vijiianabhairava mentions 112 dhiiraIJiis or types of yoga. It  is a book on yoga, not on philosophy, but its system of yoga can  be better understood if one is acquainted with its metaphysical  background. The reader would be well advised to go through  the author's Introduction either in Pratyabhijiiiihrdayam or  Siva-siltras in order to get an idea of the metaphysics on which  the present yoga system is based.  

The means of communion with Bhairava have been classified  under four broad heads in Saiviigama, viz., anupiiya, siimbhava,  siikta and iiI,Iava. These have been described in detail by the  author in the Introduction to the Siva Siltras. In this book, in  the notes under each dharaIJii it has been indicated whether it is  iiIJava or siikta or siimbhava. Anupiiya literally means 'no means',  'without any means' which has, however, been interpreted by  Jayaratha as liat upiiya i.e. very little means. Just a casual hint  by the guru or the spiritual director is enough for the advanced  aspirant to enter the mystic state. Such a rare case is known as  that of anupiiya . .4IJava, siikta and siimbhava are definite techni ques. These are, however, not watertight compartments. The  aspirant has to pass from the iiIJava to siikta and finally from the  siikta to the siimbhava state.  

Vijiianabhairava has utilized all the traditional techniques of  yoga-postures, mudriis or gestures, development of priiIJasakti,  awakening of kUIJt/aiinl, mantra japa or recital of words of power  or sacred formulae, bhakti (devotion) jiiiina (realization through 

xiv Vijnanabhairava  

understanding), meditation, bhiivanii (creative contemplation). It  even uses certain techniques of very non-formal nature, e.g.,  looking vacantly at the dark night, high mountains, watching  the condition of consciousness in a see-saw movement, the con dition of consciousness before falling asleep, intently looking at a  vase without partition, etc. It has recommended one hundred  and twelve dhiiraIJiis ad modum recipientis (according to the mode  of the recipients) keeping in view the fitness or competence of the  aspirants so that any technique that may suit a particular aspi 

rant may be adopted by him.  

The ultimate goal recommended by the text is identification  with Bhairava-undifferentiated universal consciousness which is  the heart (hrdaya), nectar (amrta). Reality par excellence (tattva  or mahiisattii) essence (svariipa); Self (iitman), or void (Jiinyatii)  that is full. This involves the following processes:  

(I) Perfect interiorization so that one is absorbed in the heart  of the Supreme.  

(2) Passing from vikalpa or the stage of differentiating, dich otomizing thought-construct to nirvikalpa stage of thought-free,  non-relational awareness.  

(3) Disappearance of the limited pseudo-lor ego which is  only a product of Prakrti and tire emergence of the Real  Universal I (piirIJiihantii) which is divine.  

(4) Dissolution of cilia or the individual mind into cit or  universal Consciousness.  

This is the essence of yoga according to Vij;;iinabhairava.  

IMPORTANT BASES OF THE DHARA~AS  

RECOMMENDED  

The important bases of the dhiiraIJiis recommended in the text  are the following:  

I. PriiIJa:  

Indian thought believes that between the body and the mind  or between the material or physical energy and mental energy,  there is priiPJa which is an intermediary link between the two.  The word priiPJa has been variously translated as the vital force. 

Introduction xv  

biological energy, bio-plasma, etc. It has been a moot point in  western Philosophy and Psychology as to how mind which is  psychic in nature affects the body which is physical or material  in nature. According to Indian Philosophy. between the body  and manas or mind. there is prii1)a which serves as a link  between the two. PriiIJa is not mind; it is insentient, but it  is not like gross physical energy. It is subtle biological  energy which catches the vibrations of the mind and transmits  them to the nerves and plexuses and also physical vibrations  to the mind. By controlling the mind one can control the priiIJa,  and by controlling the prii1)a. one can control the mind.  

According to Saivagama, priiIJa is not something alien to safnl·it  or consciousne~s. but the. first evolute of satnvil (consciousness)  Priik satin';1 priiIJe pariIJatii. In the process of creation SOInl';1  or consciousness is at first transformed into priiIJa. So priiIJa is a  phase of consciousness itself.  

The word priiIJa is used both in the general sense of priiIJanii  or priiIJa-sakli or life-principle or life-force and in the specific  sense of various biological functions. This life-force expresses  itself in breath. PriiIJa or the life-force cannot be contacted  directly. It is only through breath that priiIJa or life-force can be  influenced. So the word prii1Ja is generally used for breath also  though sometimes the word viiyu (as priiIJa-viiyu) is added to it.  In this context the word prii1Ja is used for the breath that is  exhaled. and apiina is used for the breath that is inhaled.  The word priiIJa is thus used in three senses - (I) in a general  sense of priiIJa-sakli or life-force, (2) in a <;pecific sense accord 

ing to the various biological functions, and (3) in the sense of  breath.  

The breath is associated with inhalation and exhalation. "T he  very first dhiiraIJii (described in verse 24) utilize'l the two pole<;  of respiration. viz. I dViidasiinla-a di!;tance of twelve finger'l  from the nose in the outer space where prciIJa or exhalation ends  and hrt or the centre inside the body where apiina or inhalation  ends. One has to concentrate on the<;e two points. After .some  practice. he will realize the 'ltate of Bhairava  

Similarly. versec; 2,3,4.5.6,7 etc. descrihe how priiIJa can be  utilized in varj.ouo; wayc; for reali7.ing the nature cf Bhairava. 

xvi VijRanabhairava  

• Several dhiiral')iis utilize the awakening of priil')a-sakti in the  suiUmnii for the realization of spiritual perfection. It is by the  efflorescence of priil')asakti in the sUlumnii or the medial channel  of priil')a in the interior of the spinal column that kUI')t/aiinl  awakens when one has the experience of the union of the indi 

vidual consciousness with the universal consciousness. Verses  35,38, 39 etc. refer to such dhiirQl')iis. Notes on these verses  should be carefully read.  

Ucciira is the natural characteristic of priil')a. Ucciira means  expression in the form of niida or sound-subtle, inarticulate, or  unmanifest and moving upward. Tbe unmanifest, inarticulate  sound or niida is known as varl')Q. Abhinavagupta says:

(Tantraloka'V, 131)  

"From the uccara of the general priil')Q, there vibrates an  imperceptible, inarticulate sound which is known as varl')a."  Svacchanda Tantra says:

(Tantraloka VI, 2(7)  

"There is one varl')a in tbe form of niida (sound vibration) in  which lie all the varl')as (letters) latently in an undivided form. As  it is ceaseless, it is called aniihata i.e. unstruck, natural, sponta neous, uncaused. As all the vargas (letters) originate from this  niida, therefore, is it called varl')a proleptically. Vide verse 38 of  tbe text.  

How are we to know about tbis inarticulate sound ? In the  'following verse, Abhinavagupta throws a hint as to how we can  form an idea of it. 

Introduction  

\{l'>eij{1 «Illi1 ~ ~ ~ ~: II  

(Tantraloka V. 132)  

xvii  

"The mli blja and sam/tiira blja are its main forms". In the  words of Jayaratha main forms mean pradhiinam abhivyakti sthanam i.e. the srlli blja and sam/tiira blja are the main spots of  its revelation. sa is the sTili blja or the mystic letter denoting  expiration and ha is the iam/tiira bija or the mystic letter  denoting inspiration.  

[n verses 155 and 156 of Vijiianabhairava is given the process  by which this niida expresses itself in the breath of every living  creature. "The breath is exhaled with the sound sa and then  inhaled with the sound ha. Thus the empirical individual always  recites this mantra hafTISab (verse ISS). Throughout the day and  night he (the empirical individual recites this mantra 21,600 times.  Such a japa (recitation) of the goddess is mentioned which is  quite easy to accomplish; it is only difficult for the ignorant."  

(verse 156).  

This harrzsab mantra is repeated by every individual automati cally in every round of expiration-inspiration. Since the repeti.  tion is automatic, it is known as ajapii japa i.e. a repetition of the  mantra that goes on spontaneously without anybody's effort.  This hafTISab (I am He i.e. I am Siva or the Divine) is the iidi  prii7)a i.e. initial prii1)a which is the first evolute or transform ation of consciousness.  

There are two ways in which this prii7)ic mantra can be utilized  for the awakening or rise of KU7)(iaiinl. One is anusandhiina or  prolonged mental awareness of this automatic process which has  been referred to above. Another way is conscious japa or redta.  tion or repetition of this mantra as so'ham or simply aum (amt).  This requires a further elucidation.  

In the descending arc of the creative activity from conscious·  ness to inconscient matter or in other words from the conscious  creative pulsation of the Divine Sakli known as pariiviik or  vimarśa at the highest level down to vaikharl or gross speech at  the level of the living being, there is a movement downward  from the centre of Reality to the periphery in the successive  form of pariivii7)l, (the spiritual logos in which the creativexviii VijiiDnabhairava  

process is in the form of niida). pasyantl (viik-sakli. going forth  as seeing. ready to create in which there is no difference between  viicya (object) and viicaka (word). madhyamii (Jabda) in its subtle  form as existing in the anta[JcarQ1)Q prior to its gross.  manifestation), vaikharl (as gross, physical speech). This is  the process of snli or the outward movement or the descend 

ing arc. In ordinary lapa (muttering of mantra or sacred  formula), the process is just the reverse. In this the sound  moves from vaikharl through madhyamii towards pasyantl and  pariiviitll.  

Ordinarily. lapa starts in vaikharl form (vocal muttering). It  depends entirely on the will and activity of the person who does  the japa. After constant practice of lapa for some years, an  extraordinary thing happens. A time comes when the lapa does  not depend on the will and activity of the reciter any longer. It  now goes on automatically inwardly without any effort on the part  of the reciter. It becomes an alapiijapa. When this proceeds for  a long time. the priitla and apana currents that normally move  in a curvilinear way on the ida and pinga/ii channels become  equilibrated; the kU1)(laiinl now awakens; the equilibrated current  now ftows upward in the su/umnii i.e. in the interior of the  spinal column. This upward movement is known as uccarQ1)Q.  Prii'.la and manas are so closely associated that manas also  acquires upward orientation along with it.  

As the ku'.lgaiinl rises. there is the experience of aniihata niida automatic, unstruck sound. The kUT)gaiinl passing through the  various cakras finally joins the Brahmarandhra, and then niida  ceases; it is then converted into lyoti Oight).  

2. Japa:  

This has already been described in connexion with the siidhanii  or spiritual praxis of prii(la above. The praxis of japa has been  mentioned in verses 90, 145, ISS, 156, etc. PrQT)avajapa leading  to the development of the various saktis or manifestation of  spiritual stages is recommended in verse 42. This is explained  under a separate head.  

3. Bhiivanii :  

. In Tantrasara, Abhinavagupla gives an excellent exposition  of bhiivanii. Man's mind manifests itself in all kinds of vikalpas 

Introduction xix  

or thought - constructs. Vikalpa is the very nature of mind. If  that is so, the aspirant should mentally seize one Suddha or pure  vikalpa, viz. of the highest I-consciousness, of the real Self as  being Siva. He has to practise the bhiivanii of this pure vikalpa.  Bhiivanii is creative contemplation. Imagination plays a very  large part in it. One has to imagine oneself with all the faith and  fervour at his command that he is Siva. This suddha vikalpa  eliminates all other vikalpas, or thoughts and a time comes  when the suddha vikalpa also ceases. Then the empirical, psycho logical self is dissolved, and one is landed in one's real,  metempirical, metaphysical Self.  

Abhinavagupta traces the following steps to Bhavana. A  sadguru or Self-realized spiritual director initiates the aspirant  into the mysteries of the iigama, into the irrefutable conviction  of the essential Self being Siva. The second step consists in sat 

tarka. Sat-tarka in this context does not mean logic-chopping,  but training the mind in harmonious consonance with the truth  of the essential Self being Siva. This culminates in Bhiivanii.  Bhiivanii is the power of spiritual attention, a total dedication  of the mind to one central thought, a nostalagia of the soul, a  spiritual thrust towards the source of one's being.  

Bhavana is finally metamorphosed into suddha vidyii whereby  the psychological I is swallowed up into the essential meta physical I. Verse 49 lays down the bhiivanii of the essential Self. In  a few other verses also, the verb form of bhiivanii, e.g. bhiivayet,  bhiivyab, etc. has been used. The bhiivanii of /aya or dissolution  of the various tattvas in a regressive order, of the gross into the  subtle, of the subtle into the subtler, of the subtler into the  subtlest, etc. is recommended in verse 54.  

4. Siinya (void) :  

Contemplation of siinya or void is another basis of dhiira7)ii  recommended. Verses 39,40,45,58,122, etc. refer to the con templation of the void. Contemplation over siinya or the void  is explained in some detail under a separate heading.  

5. Experience of Vastness or Extensive Space:  

Experience of a vast, extensive space without any trees, etc.  has no definite, concrete object as iilambana or support for the 

xx Vijiiii"abhairava  

mind. In such a condition, the vikalpas or thought-constructs  of the mind come to a dead stop, and supersensuous Reality  makes its presence felt. Verse 60 of the text describes this state.  

6. I"tensity 0/ Experience:  

Even in the intensity of sensuous experience, one can have  the experience of the Divine, provided one is careful to track  the joy felt on sucb occasions to its source. The text gives  several examples of tbe intensity of experience.  

Tbe first one is of tbe joy felt in sexual intercourse mentioned  in the verses 69-70. It should be borne in mind that this example  is given only to illustrate the intensity of experience in union.  From physical uuion, one's attention has to be directed to  spirit"al union. This does not advocate sexual indulgence. The  notes on these verses should be carefully read. The mystic  experience of Tao in Chinese esotericism is described in a  similar strain. The following lines will amply bear it out. "Thou  knowest not what is love, nor what it is to love. I will tell thee;  love is nothing other than the Rhythm of Tao.  

I have said it to thee, it is from Tao that thou comest; it is to  Tao that thou shalt return. Woman reveals herself to thy eyes  and thou thinkest that she is the end towards which the Rhythm  leads thee, but even when this woman is thine and thou hast  thrilled with her touch, thou feelest still the Rhythm within thee  unappeased and thou learnst that to appease it thou must go  beyond. Call it love if thou wilt; what matters a name? I call  it Tao.  

The beauty of woman is only a vague reflection of the form less beauty of Tao. The emotion she awakens in thee, the desire  to blot thyself out in her beauty ... believe me, it is nothing else  than the rhythm of Tao, only thou knowest it not ..... Seek not  thy happiness in a woman. She is the revelation of Tao offering  itself to thee, she is the purest form in Nature by which Tao  manifests; she is the Force which awakens in thee the Rhythm  of Tao - but by herself she is only a poor creature like thyself.  And thou art for her the same revelation as she is for thee. It  is the expression of Tao who has no limit nor form, and what  thy'soul desires in the rapture which the vision of it causes thee, 

Introduction xxi  

this strange and ineffable se~timent, is nought else than union  with that Beauty and with the source of that Beauty-with Tao.  Thy soul has lost its beloved Tao with whom it was formerly  onited and it desires reunion with the Beloved. An absolute  

reunion with Tao-is it not boundless Love? To be so absolu tely one with the Beloved that thou art entirely hers ,and she  entirely thine-a union so complete and so eternal that neither  life nor death can ever separate thee, so peaceful and pure that  Desire can no longer awake in thee, because the supreme happi ness is attained and there is only peace, peace sacred calm and  luminous. For Tao is the Infinite of the soul, one, eternal and  all-pure. "  

(Quoted in Mother India of January, 1979 from Arya. June.  1915).  

Sex is an example of the joy of intensive experience deriVed  from sparia or contact.  

Verse 71 which describes the intensive experience of joy at the  sight of a friend or relative is an example of the pleasure of rupa  or visual perception. Verse 72 gives an example of the joy of  rasa or taste and verse 73 gives an example of the joy of labda  or sound.  

7_ Mudriis and Asanas :  

Various mudriis are recommended as helpful in dhiirm.Uis.  Mudrii is a technical term meaning a particular disposition and  control of the organs of the body as a help in concentration.  Various mudriis for this purpose are described in verse 77.  

Asana means posture. Several iisanas are helpful iQ dhiirQl}ii.  Such examples are given in verses 78, 79 and 82.  The following concepts have to be clearly grasped in order to  be able to understand the dhiira1)iis recommended in VijDina bhairava.  

Klobha:  

The word K,obha means mental agitation, disquiet, turmoil,  Verse 74 says that wherever there is tUI!i or mental satisfaction  or joy, there the mind should be fixed. In all suchjoYJI or inten sive experience. it is implied that the fixation of the mind should  be without kiobha or mental agitation. Wlien one is deeply 

xxii VijRiinllbhairava  

moved by some beautiful object e.g. a beautiful woman, the  attitude should be "This beautiful tabernacle houses Siva who  is my own essential Self." It is this attitude which leads to ~he  right dharQ1)a based on aesthetic experience. If one's mind is  agitated by such experience and he is carried away by sens&  pleasure, he cannot have the proper ~iirQ1)ii. He will be unable  to utilize that experience for yogic purposes. As Spandakarika  puts it : "IRT m: snftQ ~ ~ crot ~.. (I, 9)  

"When the mental turmoil disappears, it is only then that the  highest state is attained."  

This mental turmoil is caused because of our identification of  our Self with the mind-body complex and its claimant and  clamorous de~ires.- When one is convinced that the  mind-body complex is not the Self, but rather the Divine  presence within the mind-body complex is the Self who is Siva,  then every attractive object is considered to be only the expres 

sion of Siva Himself, then the mental turmoil ceases and the  mind is fixed. on Siva whose expression that object happens  to be.  

Vikalpa:  

A vikalpa is a thought-construct. Vikalpas are various mental  counters through which man carries on the business of life.  Vikalpas may refer to various things of the external world like  tree, flower, river, etc. or various images, fancies, etc. of the mind.  In vikalpa mind sets a limit to one particular thing or idea, and  differentiates it from the rest; mind constructs a 'particular' by  means of thought which it marks off from the rest of the world  or from other ideas. Each vikalpa has two aspects; the positive  aspect consists of the idea that is selected, and the negative  consists of the rest that are set aside or rejected. Vikalpas are  concerned with particulars. Secondly, vikalpas are relational  i.e. there is always a subject-object relationship in vikalpas.  Reality is non-relational, there is no object outside Reality.  Therefore vikalpas are unable to grasp Reality.  

There is, however, onesuddha or pure vikalpa, viz., the 'thought  th!lt I am Siva'. By the bhavanii or creative contemplation of this 

Introduction xxiii  

vika/pa, all other vikalpas arc eliminated. Finally this vika/pa  also disappears and one is landed in a nirvikalpa or thought free  state which denotes the awareness of Reality.  

MADHYAVIKASA (THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE  MIDDLE STATE) :  

When the prii!la or exhalation arising from the centre of the  body does not return from the dviidaiiinta(adistance of 12 fingers  in the outer space) for a split second and the apiina or inhalation  arising from the dviidaiiinta does not return from the centre for  a split second, this is known as madhyadaJii. By intensive aware 

ness of this madhyadaiii, there is madhya vikiisa or the develop ment of the middle state.  

The madhya vikiisa can occur through several means, either  by one-pointed awareness of the pauses of prii1;la and apiina  (vide verse 25) or by means of the dissolution of all vika/pas  (vide verse 26) or by retention of prii!la and apiina (vide verse 27)  or by vikalpa-lqaya, Sakti-sankoca and Jakti-vikiisa, etc. as  recommended in the 18th Sutra of PratyabhijRiih,dayam or in the  gap between two thoughts when one thought ceases and another  is about to arise as recommended in Spandakiirikii. (III, 9).  

Sutra 17 of PratyabhijRiih,dayamsays: "lfS4rCC4ijtljM'U.,·q{iijj1f:"  which means "By the development of the madhya (middle or  centre) is there acquisition of the bliss of Cit ..  

What is this madhya (middle or centre)? /4emariija explains  it in the following way in his commentary on the above sutra.  "Samvit or the Universal Consciousness is the centre of every  thing, for everything depends on it for its existence. In the  empirical order samvit is at first transformed into prii1;la.  Assuming the role of prii!lasakti, resting in the planes of buddhi,  body etc. it abides principally in the madhya nii91, in the  innermost central channel of prii!la in the spinal column. When  the prii1)aJakti in the central channel develops or when the  central Universal consciousness develops in any other way, one  acquires the bliss of universal consciousness and becomes liberated  while living."  

So madhya-vikiisa means the development of the met empirical or universal consciousness. In sucb a state cilia or the 

xxiv VijRanabhairava  

individual empirical consciousness is transformed into citi or the  the met-empirical consciousness. •  

SONYA:  

The word Siinya means void. a state in which no object is  experienced. It has. however. been used in various senses in  this system.  

Madhyadhiima or the central channel in the interior of the  spinal column has generally been called sunya or sometimes even  sunyatisunya (absolute void). The word sOnya occurring in the  verse No. 42 of Vijiiinabhairava has been interpreted as unmonii  by Sivopidhyiya. In verse 61 madhya has been interpreted as  sunya by Sivopidhyiya. K,emarija has interpreted sunya as  miya and sunyatisunya as mahiimaya in his commentary on VII.  57 in Svacchanda Tantra. At some places. Siva is said to be  sunya or sunyati-Jiinya.  

The main philosophical sense of sunya, however, is given in  the following verse quoted by Sivopidhyiya in his commentary  on verse 127 of Vijilinabhairava :  

"MMRI .. aii' ..... ijcjat4<m: I  

ij4;M1I1III'~: ~ ;r1Jfti 4< ... wI(I:" II  

" "  

That which is free of all supports whether external existents  like jar or ftower or internal existents like pleasure, pain or  thought, that which is free of all tattvas or constitutive principles,  of the residual traces of all klelas, that is sunya. In the highest  sense, it is not sunya as such (i.e. as Don-existence)". Avidya.  asmita, raga. dvela, and abhinivela i.e. primal ignorance. the  feeling of I-ness. attraction. repulsion and fear of death are  considered to be kleias.  

Sivopidhyiya has further given a long quotation from  vimarśa-dlpika which means that Siva is full and free and  fundamental ground of all that is known as void, from whom  all the tattvas arise and in whom they are all dissolved. Since  ~iva or the foundational consciousness cannot be described in  words or any determination of thought, therefore, is He called 

'~iinya. 

Introduction xxv  

The most explicit explanation of sUnya is given in Svacchanda  Tantra in the following verse :  

.. ~ "ll'tCfq€ll"Ri ~;n1(Tif ~ I  

W41T<f: ~ ~,f(6C.~ lRI' ~m: ~ ~: I  

~'dl ijlej ~ m;:fl' ~ f.t;qfir ~" II  

(IV. 292 - 293)  

"That which is said to be lilnya (void) in this system is not  really sUnya, for siinya only means absence of objects. That is  said to be abhava or absence of existents in which all objective  existents have disappeared. It is the absolute Being, that state  which abides as transcendent and absolute peace."  

K~emaraja in his commentary on the above explains asunya  or non-void as cidanandaghana-parama-sivatattvam i.e.  parama Siva (absolute Divine Reality) who is a mass of con sciousness and bliss, mahasatta as prakiiSatmaiva hi sarve/am  bhavabhavanar,. satta i. e. the Light of Universal Consciousness,  the Reality which is the source of both existents and non-existents  and abhava as na vidyate bhava{t. sarva{t. prameyQdi prapanco  yalra i. e. that in which the manifestation of all objective  phenomena cease~. The core of the meaning of the word si2nya  is that in which there is no objective existent.  

SONYA-SATKA (THE GROUP OF SIX SONYAS) :  

Svacchanda Tantra recommends contemplation over six voids  (I V 288-290). The first sUnya which is known as urdhva silnya  or higher siinya is the stage of sakI;; the second is the  adha{t. or the siinya which is the region of the heart;  the third is the madhya or the middle sunya which is the  region of throat, palate, middle of the eye-brows, forehead and  brahmarandhra. The fourth sUnya is in vyapinl, the fifth in samana  and the sixth in unmanii. These have to be contemplated as void  and rejected. Finally the aspirant has to pass over to Parama  !'~iva who is the subtlest and the highest void, free of all conditions  (sarviivasthii-vivarjitam), who is sunya only in the sense that he  is transcendent to all manifestation and defies all characteriza tion by the mind. The other voids are siimaya i.e. meant to be  abandoned. It is only in the highest sunya i.e. paramo siva that  the mind should finally rest. The other siinyas are means for the 

xxvi Vijiiiinabhairava  

attainment of the highest Siinya (paraSUnya-pada-prapti upayabhutab).  

Vyapinl, samana, etc. are explained under prQlJ.(lva and its saktis.  

PRAl~A V A AND ITS SAKTIS :  

The word pra1')ava is interpreted in various ways-( 1) pra1')uyate  -the Supreme Self that is lauded by all, (2) pra1')an avati-that  which protects the vital forces, (3) prakarle1')a navlkaroti-that  which renovates every thing, renews the soul as it were. There  are various kinds of pra1')ava - sakta pra1')ava, saiva prQ1')ava and  Vedic pra1')ava. It is used as mantra which means a sacred  formula which protects one by reflection (mananat trayate iIi  mantraM.  

The Vedic pra1')ava is aum which is repeated as a powerful  mantra. Svacchanda Tantra describes in detail the various  saktis or energies of aum. It tells us how by the recitation of  aum, there is the upward functioning of pra1')a (the llfe force)  and ascension of KU1')rjalinl.  

In SQivagama, it is maintained that universal consciousness  (samvid), in the process of manifestation, is at first transformed  into pra1')a or life force and that is how life starts. On the arc  of ascent, by the proper recitation of aum, pra1')a again becomes  pure consciousness (samvid) while the empirical consciousness  (citta) returns to its essence, the absolute consciousness (citi).  

Dharaoa No. 19 described succinctly in verse 42 and touched  up~n briefly in verses 154-156 of Vijiianabhairava tells us how  the uccara or upward movement of pra1')ava, from gross utterance,  to subtle vibrati?n (spandana) and finally to mental reflection,  leads us on to Siva-consciousness. A detailed description of this  dhara1')ii is given below':  

By a long practice of true and concentrated uccara of aum  the energy of breath is introverted in the form of madhya sakti  or middle energy known as hamsa or kU1')rjalinl which rises in  eleven successive movements without the least effort of the will.  These movements are given below :  

l' to 3 : The first three movements consist in the recitation of 

Introduction xxvii  

a, u, m-'A' is to be contemplated in the navel, 'u' in the heart,  'm' in the mouth.  

A, u, and m are recited in the gross form. The time taken in  the recitation of each of these is one matra or mora.  4. After this appears bindu which is nasal resonance indicat ed by a point in ai and which symbolises concentrated energy  of the word. The phonemes rest in it in an undivided form. It  is a point of intense light. Since there cannot be any gross  utterance of the mantra after au';', the bindu becomes from  this stage an activity which operates by itself. Henceforward,  there is no utterance but only the rise of the pra"ic energy in a  subtle form of vibration (spandana) which becomes subtler and  subtler as it proceeds onwards. The energy of the bindu appears  as a point of light in the middle of the eye-brows. The subtlety  of the pra"ic energy in bindu measured in terms of time would  be i of a matra or mora. The time occupied in uttering a short  vowel is called a matra. K~emarija in his commentary on the  fifth verse of Vijiiiinabhairava says that bindu is a point of  light which is identified in an undivided form with all objective  phenomena.  

S. Now bindu is transformed into nada (subtle, inarticulate  sound), and the predominance of objectivity inherent in it  gradually disappears. It then assumes the form of ardhacandra  (half-moon) and appears in lalala or the forehead. The subtlety  of its vibration consists in 1 of a malra or mora.  

6. After this, when objectivity inherent in bindu completely  disappears, the energy assumes the form of a straight line and  appears in the upper part of the forehead. The subtlety of its  vibration consists in 1/8 of a matra. It is known as nirodhika or  nirodhinl (lit., that which obstructs). It is so-called, because it  prevents the undeserving aspirants from entering the next  stage of nada and the deserving ones from slipping into dualism.  

7. Nada. It is a mystical resonance and extends from the  summit of the head and expands through the sUiUmllii i.e. the  central channel. It is anahata i.e. spontaneous .sound, not  produced by percussion and is inarticulate. It never sets i:e. it  always goes on sounding in all living creatures.  

The subtlety of its vibration consists in 1/16 of a matra.xxviii ViJiianablulirara  

8. Nadanta-This is an aspect of energy beyond niida. It is  extremely subtle and resides in brahmarandhra which is a little  above the top of the head. The subtlety of its vibration consists  in 1/32 of a matra.  

After the experience of this station, the sense of identification  of the Self with the body disappears.  

9. Sakti or Energy in itself. There is a feeling of ananda or  bliss in this stage. Its matra is 1/64. Sakti is said to reside in  the skin.  

10. The next stage is that of vyapinlor vyapikii. It is all penetrating energy and fills the cosmos. K~emaraja says that in  this the limits of the body are dropped and the yogi enjoys the  experience of all pervasiveness like the sky. It is said it is ex perienced at the root of the !ikhii or tuft of hair on the head.  Its matra is 1,128.  

11. Samana-When *e vyapinl stage is reached, all spatial  and temporal limitations have been overcome, and all objectivity  has disappeared. Then the stage of samana is reached which is  only bodha or the energy of illumination which is, as K~maraja  

puts it, only an activity of thinking without any object of  thought. (mallanamatratmaka-kara~ar;;'pa-bodhamatravaseie  samanii com. on V. 5 of V.D.) Samanii resides in the sikhii or  tuft of hair on the head. Its matra is 1/256. It is through this  sakti that Siva carries on the five acts of manifestation, main 

tenance and withdrawal of the universe and veiling of Self and  revealing of Self through grace.  

If the yogi who has reached the stage of samana directs his  attention towards the universe, he acquires the supernormal  powers of omnipresence, omniscience, etc., but if he is indifferent  towards these powers, and directs his attention to still higher  realm of existence, he reaches unmana sakti and is then united  with parama ,~;va-Absolute Reality.  

The yogi who rests contented in samana saict; has only atma vyapti which is explained by K~emaraja as suddhavijiianakevalata  i.e. the isolation of pure consciousness. (Svacchanda Tantra  p. 246). He cannot attain Sil'avyapti which is the state of  identification with parama-Siva.  

13'. Unmana. The stage above samana is unmana. It is the  ultimate energy beyond all mental process. K!Jemaraja explains 

Introduction xxix  

it thus-unmanam-utkriintam-utkar/am ca manab priiptam  yatra tadunmanam i.e. 'unmanii is that state in which manas or  mental process is transcended and it reaches its highest excellence ..  Unmanii is the highest silnya (void), not sunya in the popular  sense, but in the sense of the disappearance of all objectivity. It  is Sattiimatram which, as K~emaraja explains, is the Light of  Universal Consciousness which is the fount and source of  every thing.  

According to some it is to be contemplated in the last part of  the tuft of hair on the head, and its matrii is 1/512. According  to Svacchanda Tantra, however, it is amatra, without any  measure, for being outside the province of manas (mentation), it  is beyond time. .  

As has been said above, the yogi whose consciousness rises  only upto samanii has iitmavyiipti only i.e. he has an experience  of the pure Self completely freed of limitations of miiyii and  prakrti. But this is not the highest goal of man according to  Saivigama. According to it, the highest goal is §iva-vyiipti or  §ivatva-yojanii-identification with §iva who is all-inclusive. It is  only by rising to the stage of unmanii that one can be identified  with the sviitantrya-sakti (absolute freedom) of parama §iva.  

Manas (mental process) is characterized by samkalpa-deter minate thought and purpose. and the knowledge obtained by  samkalpa is in a successive order being in time whereas unmanii  which is above thought-process and is identified with sviitantrya sakti knows all things simultaneously (manab kramato jniinam,  unmanam yugapat sthitam, vindate hyatra yugapat sarvajniidi gw)iin pariin. Svacc. Tantra V. 394-395).  

CONCLUSION:  

Vijiianabhairava gives the quintessence of all the dhiira!liis in  the following verse :  

"1fTi'Rt ~ IIlf'di(lciU ~cr :qgue4'{ I  

zm-m qfuftvf tm cr<;: ~ "'!: II" (838)  

Citi, the dynamic universal consciousness in its descent  towards manifestation assumes four forms for appearing as a  limited individual viz; (I) Cetanii which, as Sivopadhyiya 

xxx VijiUinabhairava  

explains in his commentary, means buddhi in this context (2)  minasa-manas with its characteristic activity of stl1flkaipa or  thought-constructs (3) sakti which, in this context, means  prii1J.alakti which constitutes the support of the body and  empirical life, and (4) iitmii which, in this context, means  

jlviitmii, the ego or the empirical self conditioned by the  above three.  

This is the arc of nime,a or avaroha-descent of the dynamic  universal consciousness (citi) into individual human life. It is  only at the human stage that unme,a or adhyiiroha-ascent  towards the higher life is possible. When the above four are  dissolved (parikll1J.am) into cit (the Higher Universal Divine  Consciousness), -it is only then that one attains to bhairava consciousness.  

K~emarija in his commentary on 21st nitra of section III of  the Siva-Jutras quoting this verse says, AvikaipakarupeIJD ...  sa",vedanena. . . samiiviset. Kldrk? magnab iiirlraprii1J.iidipra miitrtii", tatraiva citcamatkiirarase majjanena praliimayan.  

"One has to enter the divine consciousness by thought-free,  non-relational awareness. How? By dissolving the personal self  consisting of the body, prioa, etc. in the savoury sap of the  Universal Divine Consciousness."  

The chrysalis of the ego has to split before one can enter the  sanctum sanctorum of the Divine Presence. In the words of  Kathopani~ad Yogab prabhaviipyayau Yoga is both dissolu tion and emergence-both death and rebirth. One has to die to  live. It is a divine filiation and cannot be described in any  human language, for it is reality of a different dimension. In the  beautiful words of Dr. Anand K. Coomaraswamy. "The con dition of deification is an eradication of all otherness." It is for  this consummation that 112 dhiira1Jlis have been described in  VijRiinabhairava.

TRANSLA nON  

Bhairavi,l the sakI; ofBhairava2 says (uvaca) 0 devol (divine  one) who in manifesting the universe and treating it as your play  are my very self, I have heard in toto all the scriptures whIch  hav~ come forth from the union of Rudra' and his pair saktili or  which are the outcome of Rudrayamala Tantra, including the  Trika together with its divisions.' I have heard the Trika which  is the quintessence of all the scriptures and also all its further  essential ramifications. 7  

But 0 supreme Lord, even now my doubt has not been  removed.  

NOTES  

1. Bhairava is the word used for Supreme Reality .. Its  synonym is Parama Siva. Bhairava means the terrible one who  destroys the ego. The word Bhairava consists of three letters  bha, ra and va. The hermeneutic etymology of Bhairava  gives the following interpretation:  

'Bha' indicates bhara~a-maintenance of the universe; "ra'  indicates 'ravaoa'-withdrawal of the universe; 'va' indicates  'yamaDa-projecting or letting go of the universe i.e. manifesta tion. Thus , Bhairava indicates all the three aspects of the 

2 Vijiianabhairava  

Divine, viz., snti (manifestation), sthiti (maintenance) and  saQ1hira (withdrawal).  

Bhairavi is the sakti of Bhairava. The works of Agama or  Tantra are generally written in the form of a dialogue between  Bhairava and His sakti Bhairavi or between Siva and His consort  Pirvati or Sivi. In all these works, Bhairavi or Sakti puts a  question in the form of inquiry and Bhairava or Siva answers  the question raised.  

This is the Indian way of saying that these scripture. are a  revelation. A relevant question arises in this connexion,  "Bhairavi or Sakti of Bhairava is non-different from Bhairava;  then what is the sense in a dialogue between the two? It  requires two to enter into a dialogue, but when Bhairava and  Bhairavi are non-different, (i.e. are not two), how can there be a  dialogue between them 1" The answer is that anugraha or grace  is one of the five aspects of Bhairava (snti, sthiti, saQ1hira,  tirodhina, anugraha). His anugraha is represented by His  sakti. In order to extend His grace to humanity, He reveals  certain fundamental spiritual truths which may be inapprehen 

sible to man in his present stage of evolution. AI~ these truths  lie in a latent form at the pariiviik level where object and word,  truth and its manifestation, idea and its expression are in an  indistinguishable unity. In order that these truths may be avail 

able to man, the anugraha (grace) aspect of the Supreme Divine  assumes the role of Devi or Bhairavi who puts questions from  the paJyanll level and receives answers at that level. Both the  questions and the answers are transmitted in vaikharl form  (human language) in order that man may be able to comprehend  them. The dialogue between Bhairava and Bhairavi is a metho 

dological device for revealing truths existing at the parivik level  in lIaikharl or human language. A dialogue containing questions  and answers is the most realistic and lively form of bringing  home to the listener or reader subtle truths which are not easy of  comprehellsion.  

2. The word in Sanskrit is uviica which is past tense and  means 'said', but as the question is perennial and the answer  contains eternal truth, it is taken in the sense of present tense.  The parav4k level is beyond the category of time. So the division  of past, present, future, month. year, etc. cannot be applied to it. 

VijRtinabhairava 3  

At the pasyantllevel, the para level appears anterior. Therefore  the truth of para level is expressed at the pasyantl level in past  tense. Time is relative only to limited beings. To the Divine,  there is no division of time. In his case, it is eternal now.  

3. The word deva is derived from the root div which has  many meanings, to manifest, to play, etc. K,emarija in  his commentary on this word says, "~iRiRf",~,,"fcijd"" ~ ..  "0 my very Self whose nat~re it is to display His sport in the  form of the manifestation of the universe. The devl calls deva  as 'my very Self', because the devl is not different from the deva.  

4. Rudra: Bhairava or Siva is called Rudra, because ru  stands for ruk (disease), and dra stands for dravi (melter,  dissolver). As K,emarija puts it Rudra is samaslarugdravi.  Rudra is one who dissolves all the ills (of life).  

S. Yamala means ·pair.' K,emaraja says "Rudratacchakti samarasyatmano yamalat" i.e. Yamala connotes the union of  Rudra and His Sakti i. e. prakasa and vimarśa. It is in this  aspect that the highest scripture is revealed. He quotes tho follow ing verse in support of his statement:  

~<=6(!f.n'~I"'$I~alf,ogqIN (itCfiI (vila I .. ...  

6Cif;r~ f .. f'1 6'Jji1;d wmt 1R1J~'lI{ II  

"The most inaccessible scripture has come out in the form of  word from Siva who is the supreme source, who is free of all  division and agitation and whose form is invisible.  

Rudrayamala is also the name of an ancient Tantrika work  which has not yet been properly edited.  

6. Trikabhedam: K~emaraja explains this in the following  words: '·fii('i1illl' If'URmur.rljijl VI (Illfffi-fl/lqlcit'1+dtf4i;1lH4 ~) mor f-.iImm~IHia(lf«Sifd4I<=~'1 fuuit1iffiT lRf I"  

Trika denotes the triple divisions of Sakli, 'viz; para (phase of  highest identity, transcendent), para para (identity in difference;  intermediate), and apara (immanent). This expresses itself in the  triple division of Siva, Sakli and nara (jlva--living creatures).  This division is further complicated by the fact that in apara or  nara -level, only kriya (activity) is predominant, in para para or 

4 Vijiiiinabhairava  

Sakti level and in para or Siva level bothjiiana and kriya (know ledge and activity) are predominant.  

It should be borne in mind that the sphere of nara extends  from prithivl tattva to miiyii tattva; the sphere of sakti extends  from §uddha vidyii upto Sadiisiva and the sphere of Siva includes  only Siva and Sakti.  

7. Siiriit-siiravibhiigaSaq.: Trika is the siira or quintessence of  all the scriptures. In support of this K~emaraja quotes the  following verse:

"The (dualistic) Saiva system is superior to the vedas and  other scriptures, the system pertaining to the left-handed path is  superior to the (dualistic) Saiva one: the system pertaining to  the right-handed path is superior to the left-handed one; the  Kaula system is superior to the right-handed one and Trika is  superior to the Kaula system. "Since Trika is superior to every  other system or scripture, it has been designated as siira, the  quintessence of all philosophical systems and spiritual praxis.  

The (dualistic) Saiva system is characterized by external rituals.  In viima or left-handed path, the emphasis is laid on Self-conscious ness in the midst of sensuous experience of form, sound,  touch, taste and smell. In dak#1Ja or right-handed path, empha sis is laid on meditation. In Kaula system, the emphasis is laid  on the realization of universal consciousness. In Trika, the ideal  is not only the realization of the essential or divine Self but also  jagadiinanda in which the world is realized as the bliss of the  Divine made visible.  

What is siiriit-siiravibhiiga i. e. further essential ramification  of the above quintessence? This is what K~emaraja has to say  on his point.

THE ORDER OF PRESENTATION OF THE SUBJECT  MATTER  

From the first verse beginning with 'SrutalP deva' upto the  seventh verse, ending with 'chindhi salP§ayam', the devl enume rates her doubts. From 'sadhu, sidhu,' a part of the seventh  verse upto the 21st verses ending with Sivab priyo, Bhairava  

, briefly answers her questions. Then from the 22nd verse, begin ning with Deva, deva upto the 23rd verse, ending with brilhi  bhairava, the Devl requests Bhairava to expound to her the  means by which one can realize the Highest Reality.  

In answer to the above inquiry from 24th upto 138th verse,  Bhairavaexpounds to her 112 dhiira1)QS or types of yoga by which  one can realize the Highest Reality. After this, the Devi raises a  few more questions, and Bhairava answers them. Finally, the  Devl expresses her satisfaction over the answers and becomes  united with Bhairava.

TRANSLATION  

Oh God, from the point of view of absolute reality, what  exactly is the essential nature of Bhairava ? According to 

6 VijRiinabhairava  

Bhairava Agama (Bhairave2), (I) does it consist of the energies of  the multitude ofIetters (sabdariisikaliimayarrz3) 1 or (2) does it  consist of nine different forms(naviitmabhedena)4 for the realization  of the essential nature of Bhairava (Bhairaviikrtau) ? (3) or does  it consist of the specific mantra that unites in an integral form  the three divisions as delineated in Trisirobhairava5 (trWrobhe 

dabhinnam) (4) or does it consist of three Saktis6 (presiding  over the previously mentioned three tat/a vas) ? (5) or does it  consist of niida (power of mantra inseparably present as vimarśa  in all the words) ? or of vindu (power of mantra inseparably pre 

sent in all the objects of the universe as Prakiisa7 (6) or does it con-.  sist of ardhacandra, nirodhikii8 etc 1 (7) or does it consist of some  mysterious power l"esiding in the Cakras (energy centres in the  body) ? or the vowel-less sound of ha?9 (8) or does it consist of  purely Sak ti 110  

NOTES  

l. 'Bhairavakrtau' does not mean 'Siva of terrible form.'  'Bhairavakrtau' means Bhairal'asvarupiiya. It is a locative case in  the sense of nimitta (purpose). So 'Bhairavakrtau' means for the  realization of the svarupa or essential nature of Bllairava.  

2. 'Bhairave' here means in Bhairava Agama, according to  Bhairava Agama.  

3. The first question of the Devi is: The world consists of  objects. Each object is denoted by a word (Sabda). Sabda-riisi  is the multitude of words which is according to the Sanskrit  language, from 'a' ( ar ) to 'k~a' (Ift"). Kalii means the vimada or  creative energy of the Divine. These energies are anuttara,  iinanda, icchii, jRiina and kriyii. By these are created the various  letters from 'a' to 'k$a'. These letters give rise to the various  tattvas (constitutive principles) of which the universe is constitut 

ed. For detail, see the author's translation of Siva Siitras.  Note No. to under Sutra 7 of the II section.  

The letter 'A' indicates Prakiisa or Siva, the letter 'Ha' indi- ·cates vimarśa or Sakti. Thus Aha", includes all the letters of  the Sanskrit alphabet. This Allam or 'I' denotes the Highest 

VijRiinabhairava 7  

Reality in which there is complete union of Siva and Sakt;, and  which includes the entire subjective and the objective world.  The Divine in His aSJ)C':t of non-manifestation is known as  Parama Siva or Bhairava or Parama Brahma, in ais aspect of  manifestation, the Divine is known as Sabda Brahma. In this  first question, the Devi wants to know whether VijRiina or Bodha  Bhairava is Sabda Brahma.  

4. The second question of the Devi is whether the essential  nature of the Supreme is of nine forms (navatma) of mantras.  These as described in Netra Tantra are the following:  

(I) Siva, (2) Sadasiva, (3) Uvara, (4) Vidya, (5) Maya,  (6) Kala, (7) Niyati, (8) Puru~a, (9) Prakrti. According to others,  these are (1) Siva, (2) Sakti (3) Sadasiva, (4)Isvara (5) Sqddha  Vidya, (6) Mahamaya (7) Maya, (8) Purulja-(9) Prakrti. These are  nine forms from the point of view of tattvas (constitutive prin 

ciples). From the point of view of mantra, the nine forms are  1. ~ 2. \ 3. Iif, 4. '{ 5. ~ 6. '{ 7. I{ 8. U{ 9. 0: (II{)  5. Trisirobhairava is the name of a Tantra work which is now  lost. It summarizes the entire manifestation under three broad  categories viz., Siva, Sakt; and Nara Utva or living being). In the  third question, the Devi wants to know whether the nature of  the Supreme consists of the integral combination of these three  categories as symbolized by the mantra saub (m:). This specific  mantra is known as Parablja, Hrdaya blja or Prasada. Sa (U)  of this mantra symbolizes the tath'as from earth to maya ( 31  tattvas of Saiva philosophy); au (q\) symbolizes Suddha v;dyii,  /svara and SadiiJiva and the two dots of the visarga (:) symbolize  Siva and Sakti. For details, see the author's Note No. 2 under  the first Sutra of the Second section of the Siva-sutras.  Now of the three categories of Nara, Sakti and Siva the 'S' (~)  of the mantra Saub. (m:) covers Nara, au (m-) covers Sakti, and  the visarga (b.) covers Siva. So the 31 tattvas of Saiva Agama are  covered by Nara,· the three tattvas viz .• Suddha vidya, /sl'ara and  SadiiSiva are covered by Sakti, and the other two tattvas are  covered by Siva.  

6. In the fourth question, the Devi wants to know whether the  nature of the Supreme consists of the three Saktis-Para (trans cendent in which there is no distinction of Siva and Sakti). Apara8 VijRiinabhairal'a  

(immanent) and Pariiparii (Intermediate between the two) presid ing over the categories or principles mentioned above (in Note  5). The s~'iitantrya sokti (severeign power) of the Divine is known  as parii (transcendent), that very ,~akti wishing to create a  universe of successive order is known as paraparii (both para  and apara) and appearing as a universe of successive order is  known as aparii (immanent).  

7. Nada in this context means the vimoria present in all the  words (vacaka) and vindu means the prakiisa present in all the  objects (viicya).  

As K~emaraja puts it in his commentary, Yadi vii sarvamantra cakra-siimiinyaviryiitmaka-viSvaviicyiivibhiiga - prakiisaritpavindu  

ase~aviicakiivibhiiga-vimarśa-pariimarSamayoniidiitmakam.  In the fifth question, the Devi wants to know whether the  essential nature of Bhairava is niida-vindu-vindu which symbolizes  light or prakiisa (Siva) and which is present in an undivided form  in all objective phenomena and niida which symbolizes vimarśa  sakti that is present in an undivided form in all the words (which  signify objective phenomena).  

8. In the sixth question, the Del'l wants to know whether the  essential nature of Bhairava consists of ardhacandra nirodhikii  etc. which are a further proliferation of niida-vindu. Nirodhika  in the plural (nirodhikiib) is meant to express 'et cetera'. The 'et  cetera' refers to niidanta, Jakti, vyapinl, samanii, and finally  unmanii.  

Villdu (a point) which is present as undivided light in all  objective phenomena ( viicya ) is transformed into nuda (interior  sound). As has been said above, Vindll is concerned with object ive phenomena (l'iicya). When it is transformed into niido, the  predominance of objectivity is slightly diminished, then arises  the stage of ardhacandra where sakti appears in a curved form  like demimoon. After that when the curved nature of all objecti vity ceases completely, then arises nirodhikii, of the form of a  straight line. Nirodhikii means obstructer. This energy is so  called because she obstructs undeserving aspirants from entering  into nuda, and prevents the deserving ones from straying away  into the state of difference. When the pervasion of niida by letter  begins to abate, then the next stage of energy is known as 

Vijnanabhairava 9  

nadanta which is characterized by extremely subtle sound and  which meanS the termination of the stage of nada. When the  stage of nada ceases completely, then the· next stage is that of  Sakt; which is characterized by a sensation of spiritual' delight.  When that sensation of delight is not confined within the limit  of the body, but expands all round like the sky, then that stage  is known as Vyapinl (i. e. all-pervasive).  

When the idea of all positive and negative existents ceases  completely and only manana or the faculty of mentation remains,  then the stage of samana is achieved.  

Finally appears the unmana stage which transcends all  mentation, which achieves Siva-consciousness and is characterized  by the consciousness of unity of the entire cosmos. Here there  is the unison of Siva and Sakti. This is the stage of,Parama Siva  who is ni~kala or transcendent.  

The first question is concerned with 'matrkii, the second and  third are concerned with mantra, the fifth and sixth are concerned  with mantra-vlrya or power of mantra. The fourth is concerned  with the three Saktis of the Divine.  

9. In the seventh question, the Devi wants to know whether the  essential nature of Bhairava is some mysterious power present  in the cakras (energy-centres)in the form of letters or is it anacka  i. e. vibrating as vowel-less ha in the form of pralJaku~uJalini.  Pra~lasakti present in Su~umna ceaselessly and spontaneously goes  on vibrating as ha in a vowel-less form. This is known as  anacka kala of pralJasakti. It is known as anahala niida i. e. a  vibration without any stroke or blow. It goes on vibrating  spontaneously. No body produces it and nobody can prevent it  from vibrating. It is known as ha'1'lsa or pralJakulJf}alini.  

10. In the eighth question, the De}'i wants to know whether  the essential nature of the Supreme is pure changeless Energy  (Sakti).  

CakraruQha may also mean "Is it KUIJQalini situated in the maliidhiira  cakra" or "Is it the Aham or the divine I-consciousness resting on the  cOllective whole (calera) of letters beginning with 'a' and ending with 'ha" '?

TRANSLATION  

(The Devi puts a further question)  

Is the nature of para para sakli (transcendent-cum-immanent  Energy) and apara sakli (immanent Energy) sakala i.e. consisting  of parts or is the nature of para sakli (transcendent Energy) also  sakala ? If the nature of para sakli (transcendent Energy) is also  sakala, then it would be incompatible with transcendence.l  

Paralva or transcendence cannot be consistent with the divi sion of letters and colour or of bodies (na hi varIJavibhedena,  dehabhedena va bhavel paratvam) ; paratva or transcendence con sists only in indivisibility (niikalalvena); it (transcendence) cannot  

co-exist with sakala (a composite of parts) (sakalalve na lad bhavet).s Oh Lord bestow your favour on me, and remove my  doubt compietely. NOTES  

1. Parii, pariiparii, aparii.  

SviiJantrya sakli, the Absolute Sovereign power of Parama  Siva is para i. e. transcendent. Every thing at that level is in  the form of salflvit or consciousness. This is the level of  absolute non-dualism (abheda). This is parama Siva's para sakti.  

Where there is bhediibheda i. e. both identity and difference or  identity in difference that is known as pariiparii sakli. Just as  an elephant or a city seen in a mirror is both identical and  different from the mirror, even so is the position of pariiparii 

Vijiianabhairava 11  

sakti, Where everything appears as difterent from each other,  that is the level of apara sakti.  

2. There can be Sakalatva or aspect of division in paraparii  and apara. If sakalatva or divisibility is assumed to be an aspect  of para also, then that would be incompatible with the very  nature of para which is completely transcendent to division. In  ParitriIl1siki. etc (p. 124) does the sakal a aspect which has been  described for the meditation of certain mantras concern only  apara devl and para para devl or also para devi? If it concerns  para devl also. then it would be flagrant contradiction in terms.  for by its very definition para is niikala or transcendent to divi 

sion or parts. How can sakala go with ni$kala? This is what  the Devl wants to know.

Bhairava said  

Good! Good! Dear one. you have put questions which pertain  to the very quintessence of Tllotra. Though. the matter is 

12 VijRanabhairava  

most esoteric, oh auspicious one, yet shall I explain it to you.  Whatever has been declared to be the composite form (Sakala)1  of Bhairava, that oh goddess should be considered as insub stantial (asarataya), as phantasmagoria (lit. as the net of Indra),  as magical illusion (maya), as dream, as the mirage of a town of  Gal'Jdharvasz in the sky. The sakal a aspect of Bhairava is taught,  as a prop for meditation, to those who are of deluded intellect,  who are interested in ostentatious performance of rituals, it has  been declared for those people who are a prey to dichotomising  thought-constructs (vikalpanihatatmanam). 3  

NOTES  

1. All manifestation from gods down to the mineral is  known as sakala. Sakala is the sphere of maya tattva. It con sists of bheda-difference or division. The essential nature of  Bhairava cannot be known by means of sakala which consists  of difference and division.  

2. Gandharvas are said to be celestial musicians who are  believed to have their town in the sky which is entirely imaginary  even so is the sakala form of Bhairava.  

3. If the reading is taken as vikalpanihitatmanam it would  mean 'who are established in dichotomising thought-constructs'.

Vijnanabhairava 13  TRANSLATION  

In reality, Bhairava is neither of the form of nine (navatma),  nor a multitude of letters (sabdarasl) nor of the three heads  (triSira) nor of three saktis, nor consisting of niida and bindu,  nor of ardhacandra, nirodhika, etc., nor is His essence concerned  with the piercing of the (six) cakras, nor does sakti or Energy  constitute His essence.l  

(Then why have these been described by the scriptures as  Bhairava's essence at various places ?)  

The above concepts are used for those whose intellect is not  yet mature enough to grasp Reality (in its highest aspect), Just  as a bogy is used to frighten away children from their obstinacy  for getting some worthless or undesirable thing. These concepts  play the same role as the bonbon of the mother. They are meant  to induce the aspirants to tread the path of righteousness and  spiritual practices in order that they may ultimately realize the  nature of Bhairava which is non-different from their essential  Self.2  

NOTES  

1. For the explanation of the various alternatives given above  see the notes under the verses 2-4.  

2. As a bogy is used to frighten away children from their  obstinacy for getting a .vorthless and undesirable thing, even so  these concepts are used for dissuading men from sense-pleasures.  As mothers offer a bonbon to children to induce them to pursue  a right course, even so these concepts are used to induce men, to  tread the path of righteousness.

TRANSLA TION  

[If the sakaTa aspect of Bhairava does not reveal His essen tial nature, then what is His ni$kaTa aspect by knowing which  one may have an idea of His paravasthO (the highest state).  

Bhairava now describes the ni$kala (transcendent) aspect of  the Supreme in the above four verses].  

Paravastha (the highest state) of Bhairava is free (unmukta) of  al\ notions pertaining to direction (dik), time(kala), nor can  that be particularized (avise$i{li) by some definite space (dda) or  designation (uddda). In verity (paramiirthatalz) that can neither  be indicated (vyapade$!um asakyii) nor described in words  (akathyii)1.14  

[Then is it impossible to have any experience of her? Bhairava  anticipates this question and answers that in the fol\owing  verse].  

One can be aware of that only when one is completely free of  aU thought-constructs (vikalponmukta-gocara). One can have an  experience of that bliss in his own inmost self (when one is  completely rid of the ego, and is established in piir{lahanta i.e.  in the plenitude of the divine I-consciousness).2  

That state of Bhairava which is fuIl of the bliss of non-differ ence from the entire universe (bharitakiirii)3 is alone Bhairavl or  Sakt; of Bhairava. 15 

Vijiianabhairava 15  

That should, in verity, be known as His essential nature,  immaculate (vimaialTl)' and inclusive of the entire universe  (visvapura/Jam). Such being the state of the highest Reality, who  can be the object of worship, who is to be satisfied with  worship.616.  

That ni/kala state of Bhairava which is celebrated in this way  is alone the highest state. That is declared as parii devl, the  highest goddess, parii or highest not only in name, but because  that is actually her highest form (pararupe/Ja).17  

NOTES  

I. K~emaraja in his commentary (viv!ti)says that vyapadei/um  a.sakyii (cannot be indicated) hints at the fact that she cannot be  talked about even in madhyamii (subtle) speech (madhyamiijalpii vi/ayii), and akathyii (indescribable in words) hints at the fact  that she can far less be described in ordinary human language  (vaikharyiipyavyiivar/Jiyii).  

2. The 14th verse hints at the highest state of Bhl\irava in  a negative way. It transcends direction, time, space and desi gnation. It cannot be characterized or described in any human  language.  

The 15th verse hints at that state in a positive way. It says  that though it is beyond description, it is not beyond experience  (anubhava). There are two indispensable conditions (both of which  are interconnected) under which one can have an experience of  it. (I) It can be within the range of experience if one can rid  oneself of all thought-constructs (vikalponmuktagocarii). The  activity of mind consists in all kinds of thought-constructs. When  one can get rid of thought-constructs, the mind is stilled. In  that hour of silence emerges the essential Reality from behind  the veil. It is the mind that acts as a veil, a barrier, a screen.  Mind is the slayer of the Real. Truly has it been said "Be still,  my heart, and know." (2) If one can get rid of the ego, the false,  artificial 'I' and take a plunge in his inmost essential Self, he will  have the experience of a delight which beggars description, a  peace that passeth all understanding (anta{l sviihubhaviinandii).  Truly has it been said "He saveth life who loseth it." 

16 VijRiinabhairava  

This is siimbhava yoga. Though the pariivaslhii (highest state)  of Bhairava cannot be described, it can be experienced.  3. That state of Bhairava is plenary state, a universal, all  pervasive delight of creativity (bhariliikiirjj). It is this which is  His sakli or Bhairavi which is not exclusive of the universe but  inclusive of it. It is only when we miss the whole and cling  to the part, the sakal a aspect of Bhairava that we stumble.  4. K~emaraja says in his commentary that Bhairava's essential  nature has been characterized as vimala (immaculate) because  thougb it manifests the universe on its :>wn screen, it is not  veiled by it (svabhilyiibhiisita-jagadaniicchiiditam).  S. When the essential nature of Bhairava is recognized as our  own inmost self, the distinction between the worshipper and the  worshipped disappears and there dawns a sense of non-dualism.

Since there is always non-difference between Saklil and posses sor of sakti (saktimiin) therefore being -endowed with His (i.e.  Saktiman's) attributes Sakli becomes the bearer of the same  attributes.1l Therefore being non-different from para (the highest  i.e. Bhairava) she is known as para (the highest i.e. Bhairavl). 18  

The burning power of fire is not accepted as separate from  fire even after full consideration (even so the pariiSakli is not  separate from Bhairava). Only it is described in a distinct way as  a preliminary step for the listener towards its knowledge (lit .•  towards entry into its knowledge)3 19 

Vijiiiinabhairava 17  NOTES  

1. Sakti means power, capacity to effect something.  2. Just as Bhairava has the attributes of omniscience, omni potence, etc., even so His SakI; Bhairavi has the same attributes.  3. The power of burning of fire is not anything separate  from fire. Only it is described separately so that one may get  acquaintance with fire after which one can find out its other  attributes. Even so pariisakli is not anything separate from para  (the supreme). Parasakti is described separately so that she may  prove as a first step towards the realization of para or  Bhairava.

When in one who enters the state of Sakli (i.e. who is identi fied with Sakli), there ensues the feeling of non-distinction (bet ween Sakli and Siva), then he acquires the state of Siva, (for) in  the iigamas (iha), she (sakli) is declared as 'the door of entrance  (into Siva) (Lit., Sakli is like Siva'sface)l 20. Just as by means of  the light of a lamp, and the rays of the Sun, portions of space.  etc.- are known3 even so, Oh dear one, by means of Sakli is Siva  (who is one's own essential Self) cognized (i.e. re-cognized). 21  

NOTES  

1. Just as one recognizes a person by his face, even so one  recognizes Siva by His Sakli who is like His face.18 VijRiinabhairava  

2. Et cetera included forms, figures.  

3. There are three points suggested by this simile (1) ;ust as  the flame of the lamp is not different from its light; just as the  rays of the sun are not different from the sun, even so sakte is  not different from Siva. (2) Just as through the lamp or the sun.  objects of the world are perceived, even so through Sakti the  universe is known. (3) Just as to perceive the light of the lamp,  another lamp is not required; just as to perceive the sun, another  sun is not required; they are known by their own light. Even  so, Siva is known by His Sakti who is not different from him.

[Now that the essential nature of pariidevl (Supreme goddess  or Sakti) has been hinted at, Bhairavi wants to know how that  essential nature can be realized.]  

o God of all gods, bearing the emblem of the trident,l and  having cranium as your ornament,2 how can that Supreme  goddess (the Highest Sakti) who transcends all notions of direc tion, space and time and all manner of description be known ?  By what means can that complete state of Bhairava which is full  of the bliss of non-difference from the universe (hharitiikiirii) be  realized? In what way is the pariidevl (the Highest Sakti) said to  

. be the door of entrance into Bhairava? Please tell me in the  Vaikharl form (in human language) that which I know fully 

Vij;;anabhairava 19  

well at the para level3 or please instiuct me in such a manner  that I may understand it fully.  

NOTES  

1. Bearing the emblem of the trident (trisii/a). Bhairava is said  to be bearing the trident, because the three spikes of the trident  represent icchii (will), j;;ana (knowledge) and kriya (activity) which  are the main characteristics of Bhairava.  

2. Bhairava is generally represented as having a cranium bowl  in his hand. This kapa/a or cranium-bowl symbolizes the universe  consisting of words and objects which betoken Bhairava's sva tantrya (absolute freedom) and caitanya (supreme consciousness).  

3. Being the para sakti (Highest Sakli) of Siva, she already  knows the truth at the para (highest) level, but she  wants Bhairava to tell it to her in the Vaikharl form (gross  speech, human language). Vedmi-I know is present tense. If  

she knows, why does she request Bhairava to tell it to her? The  explanation is that she knows it at the para level, at the trans cendental level, now she wants its exposition at the empirical  level.

TRANSLATION  

Bhairava says:  

Para devi or Highest Sakti who is of the nature of visarga1  goes on (ceaselessly) expressing herself upward (urdhve) (from  the centre of the body to dviidaJantaB or a distance of twelve  fingers) in the form of exhalation (pra1;la) and downward (adhafi>  (from dvadasanta to the centre of the body) in the form of  

inhalation (jiva or apana)oS By steady· fixation of the mind 

20 VijRiinabhairava  

(bharQIJiit)4. at the two places of their origin (viz., centre of the  body in the case of priif)a and dviidaiiinta in the case of apiina),  there is the situation of plenitude (bharitiisthitilJ, which is the  state of pariiSakti or nature of Bhairava).&  

NOTES  

1. Visargatma-who is ofthe nature of visarga. The word  visarga means letting go, projection or creation, i.e. who is creat ive. The creative function of the Divine includes two movements outward and inward or centrifugal and centripetal. In living  beings, the outward or centrifugal movement is represented by  expiration or exhalation; the inward or centripetal movement is  represented by inspiration or inhalation. Parii or parii devl or  Parii lakti is designated as Visargiilmii, because it is by this  rhythm of centrifugal and centripetal movement that she carries  on the play of life whether in the macrocosm or the microcosm.  This movement is known as ucciira or spandana or ceaseless  throb of Pariidevi.  

In Sanskrit, visarga is represented by two points or dots one  above the other. One point in this case is dviidaiiinla where  priif)a ends and the other is the hft or centre of the body where  apiina ends. It is because of these two points also that  Parasakti is known as visargatma.  

2. Dvadasanta-literally meaning 'end of twelve' indicates the  point at a distance of 12 fingers from the tip of the nose in the  outer space where expiration arising from the centre of the  human body, and passing through the throat and the nose ends.  This is known as biihya dviidasiinta or the external dviidaiiinta.  

3. The apiina or inhalation is called jlva, because it is the  inhalation or return movement of the breath that is responsible  for life.  

4. BharQIJiit here means by close observation or one-pointed  awareness. Awareness of what? Sivopadhyaya in his commen tary clears this point in the following way:  

"BharaQflditi - nityonmiiadadyasphurattiitmabhairavlyaiakty upaiaksaf)iit. i.e. bharaf)iit here means by an intent awareness  of that who by implication is the ever-risen initial flash of the  . sakli of Bhairava. 

Vijiianahhairava 21  

5. The dhiiragii or the yogic practice referred to in this verse  is the following:  

There are two points or poles between which respiration goes  on constantly. One of these is dvadaSiinta in the outer space  where pralJa or exhalation ends and the other hrt or the centre  inside the body where apiina or inhalation ends. At each of these  points, there is visriint; or rest for a split second. The breath  does not actually stop there totally but remains in the form of  a throb of sakt; in suspended animation and then again the  breathing process starts. One should contemplate over the sakt;  that appears in the period of rest and should remain mindful  of it even while the breathing process starts. By constant practice  of this dhiira1)ii, he will realize the state of plenitude of Bhairava  (bharitii sthitib).  

As this practice is without any support of vikaipa, it is  Siimbhava upiiya.  

There is another important interpretation of this dhiiralJii.  In inhalation, the sound of ha is produced; in exhalation, the  sound sab is produced; at the junction point in the centre the  sound of ", is added. So the whole formula becomes 'Harpsal.l'.  The paradevi goes on sounding this formula or mantra ceaselessly  in every living being. Hrdaya or the centre is the starting point  of the sound ha and dvadasanta is the starting point of the  sound sab. By contemplating over these two points, one  acquires the nature of Bhairava. This would be an alJava upaya.  Sab represents Siva; ha represents Sakti; ", represents nara.  So in this practice, all the three main elements of Trika  philosophy. viz, Siva, SaJa; and Nara are included.

22 Vijiianabhairava  TRANS LA TION  

Of the breath (exhalation or praIJa) arising from the inner i.e.  the centre of the body (hTt) there is non-return for a split second  from the dvadasanta (a distance of twelve fingers from the nose  in the outer space), and of the breath (inhalation or apana arising  from dvadasanta i. e. the outer space, there is non-return for a  split second from the centre of the body (hTI).l If one fixes his  mind steadily at these two points of pause, one will find that  Bhairavi the essential form of Bhairava is manifested at those  two points.'  

NOTES  

1. The pause of priJ,la in the dvadasanta is known as bahi!)  kumbhaka or external pause. The pause of the apana in the  internal centre of the body is known as anta!) kumbhaka or  internal pause By the anusandhana or one-pointed awareness of  these two pauses, the mind becl!)mes introverted, and the activity  

of both pralJa and apana ceases, and there is the upsurge of  madhya dasa i. e. the path of the madhya naq,1 or sU/umna  becomes open.  

2. If one mentally observes the above two pauses, he realizes  the nature of Bhairava. This is alJava upaya inasmuch as this  process involves the dhyana or meditation on the two kumbhakas  or pauses of prib)a and apana.

TRANSLATION  

When the middle state develops by means of the dissolution  of all dichotomising thought-constructsl the praIJa-sakti in the 

VijRanabhairava 23  

form of exhalation (prafJa ) does not go out from the centre (of  the body) to dvadasanta.2 nor does that sakli in the form of  inhalation (apana) enter into the centre from dvadaSanta. }o this  way by means of Bhairavi who expresses herself in the form of  the cessation of prafJa (exhalation) and apana (inhalation), there  supervenes the state of Bhairava.3  

NOTES  

1. In this dhiiraOii, prafJa (exhalation) and apana (inhalation)  cease and madhya dasa develops i.e. the prafJasakti in the sil,s"umna  develops by means of nirvikalpabhava i. e. by the cessation of  all thought-constructs; then the nature of Bhairava is revealed.  

Sivopiidhyiiya in his commentary says that the nirvikalpa  bhava comeS about by Bhairavl mudra in which even when the  senses are open outwards, the attention is turned inwards to wards inner spanda or throb of creative consciousness which is the  basis and support of all mental and sensuous activity, then all  vika/pas or thought-constructs cease. The breath neither goes  out, nor does it come in, and the essential nature of Bhairava  is revealed.  

2. Dvadasanta means a distance of 12 fingers in the outer  space measured from the tip of the nose.  

3. The difference between the previous dharQIJa and this one  lies in the fact that whereas in the previous dhiiraoii, the madhya  dasa develops by one-pointed awareness of the pauses of prafJa  and apana, in the present dharafJa, the madhya daSa develops  by means of nirvikalpa-bhava.  

Abhinavagupta has quoted this dhOrafJa in Tantriiloka v.22  p. 333 and there also he emphasizes nirvikalpa-bhava. He says that  one should fix one's mind with pointed awareness on the junc tion of prafJa, apana and udana in the centre, then prafJa and  apana will be suspended; the mind will be freed of all vikalpas.  madhya dasa will develop, and the aspirant will have the reali zation of his essential Self which is the nature of Bhairava.  

Sivopiidhyiiya says that since this dharafJCl takes the help of  madhyadasa, it may be considered to be an afJava upaya. But  the development of madhyadasa is brought about by nirvikalpa-

24 Vijiiiinabhairava  

hhiiva in this dhiira1)ii. From this point of view, it may be  considered to be siimbhava upiiya.

When the Sakti in the form of exhalation (recitii) is retained  outside ( at dviidasiinta), and in the form of inhalation (puritii)  is retained inside (at the hrt or centre), then at the end of this  practice,l the Sakti is known as Siintii2 or tranquiIlized and  through Sakti .~iinta Bhairava3 is revealed.  

NOTES  

1. By meanS of continuous practice of kumbhaka or reten tion of breath in the above way, physical and mental  tranquillity is experienced, and madhya dasii is developed. The  sense of bheda or difference between prii1)a and apiina dis appears. That is why this prii1)a sakt; is known as siintii.  

2. On account of the disappearance of bheda or difference  between prii1)a and apiina the Sakli is known as Santa or which  in this context means 'subsided', 'ceased'.  

3. Bhairava ( the divine self) is called Siinta (peaceful) be cause He transcends all the limits of name and form and in Him  there is no trace of difference or duality.  

This dhiira1)ii is a variety of .A1)ava upiiya.

2. Miiliidhiira cakra is situated in the spinal region below the  genitals. A cakra is a centre of pra1J,ic energy located in the  p,a1J,amaya kosa in the interior of the body. This dhara1J,a  refers to the rise of KU1J,tjalint which goes in a flash into dvada 

santa or Brahmarandhra (the cakra at the top of the head) and  dissolves in it. This is known as cit-ku1J,tjalini or akrama kU1J.tja lini i.e. kU1J,rJalini that does not pass successively through the  cakras but goes directly to Brahmarandhra.  

3. Dviia!kante (twice six) means dvadasanta at the end of  12 fingers. This dvadasanta refers to Brahmarandhra which is at  a distance of 12 fingers from the middle of the eye-brows (bhru madhya).  

4. In dvadasanta or Brahmarandhra, KU1J,tjalini gets dissolved  in prakaJa or light of consciousness abiding in Brahmarandhra.  In that prakasa is revealed the nature of Bhairava.  

Inasmuch as this dhiira1J,ii depends on the bhavana of pra1J,a  sakti, this is a1J,ava upaya. Netra Tantra, however, takes it a  Sambhava upaya. (VIII, p. 200).

NOTES  

1. The twelve successively higher centres of energy (krama dviidasakam) are: I.janmiigra, 2. mula, 3. Kanda, S. niibhi,  S. hrdaya. 6. KaIJtha, 7. tiilu, 8. bhrilmadhya, 9. laliita. 10.  brahmarandhra, 11. sakti, 12. vyiipinl.  

These are known as dviidasasthiina or twelve stations.  These are stages of the rising kUIJt}alini. They are correlatives  of twelve vowels. The first four stages or stations or centres of  energy are lower (a para) and concern bheda or difference.  i. Janmiigra is at the level of the generative organ. Since  the generative organ is concerned withjanma or birth of indivi duals, therefore the centre of energy at this level is known as  janma, or janmiidhiira (basis of generation) or janmasthiina (the  station which is involved in generation) or janmiigra (janmiigra  means the point or head of the generative organ.)  ii. Milia, generally known as muliidhiira or the root centre.  This is in the spinal centre of region below the genitals.  iii. Kanda, a bulbous or tuberous root, so called, because it is  a tangle of many nerves. •  

iv. Niibhlor navel. The MaIJipura cakra is situated near it.  After this, the following five are concerned with subtler ener gies known as bhediibheda or pariipara.  

v. Hrd or heart. .  

vi. KaIJlha-the cavity at the base of the throat.  vii. Tiilu-palate  

viii. Bhrumadhya-centre between the eye-brows.  ix. Laliita-Forehead.  

In the following three stages, the energy is of the form of para  or abheda.  

x. Brahmarandhra-The apex of the cranium.  

xi. ,sakti-pure energy which is not a constituent of the  body.  

xii. Vyiipinl-the energy which appears when KUIJt}alinr  finishes its journey.28 Vijiiiinabhairava  

2. The twelve successive letters are the following twelve  vowels;  

1. a, 2. a, 3, i, 4. i, 5. u, 6. ii, 7. e, 8. ai, 9, 0, 10. au, 11. alP,  12. al;!.. These vowels have to be meditated on in the above  twelve stages of the kUQQalini.

NOTES  

1. Miirdhiinta here means dvadasanta i.e. Brahmarandhra, a  space covered by twelve fingers from the middle of eye-brows.  2. Just as a river is crossed by means of a bridge, even so  the praQic energy has to be crossed over by an esoteric tech nique of bhriik,epa. Then that praQic energy will be converted  into cit-sakti, and the aspirant's consciousness wiIl rise higher  than that of the Brahmarandhra and he will have a feeling of  omnipresence.

The yogi should meditate in his heart on the five voids! of the  five senses which are like the five voids appearing in the circles.  of motley feathers of peacocks. Thus will he be absorbed in the  Absolute void.8  

NOTES  

1. Five voids or simya-paiicakam. This means that the yogi  should meditate on the five ultimate sources of the five senses.  i.e. the five tanmiitras, sound as such, form as such, etc. which  have no concrete appearance and are mere voids.  

There is also a double entendre in sunyapaiicakam. Just as  there are five holes in the circles of the feathers of the peacocks  -one above, one below, one in the middle, and one on each  side, even so the yogr should meditate on the five ultimate  sources of the sense i.e. the five tanmlitras as five voids.  

2. Circles-m~(ialas. There is a double entendre in the word  m~(iala also. In the case of the peacock, it means the circles  in the feather; in the case of the yogi, it means the senses.  (m~(ial'fl rasasliral'fl llinti iti ma{l(iallini-those that carry the  quintessence of the five objects of sense are ma1J(ialas, i.e. the  five senses).  

3. The Absolute void is Bhairava who is beyond the senses  and the mind, beyond all the categories of these instruments.  From the point of view of the human mind, He is most void.  From the point of view of Reality, He is most fuIl, for He is  the source of all manifestation.

Fixing one's attention on the interior1 of the cranium (kapala)  and seated with eyes closed,2 with the stability of the mind,3 one  gradually discerns that which is most eminently discernible.'  

The word kapa/a means 'cranium.' There is also an esoteric  meani~g of his word. Sivopadhyaya quotes the following verse  from Tantrakosa in this connexion.  

"Kasabdena parasakti(i pa/aka(i Sivasa",jiiaya /  

Siva-Sakti-samayoga(i kapa/a(i paripathyate" II  

"The word ka signifies parasakti or the supreme divine  Energy, and the word pala meaning 'protector' signifies Siva.  The whole word kapala is therefore, used .in the sense of union  between Siva and Sakti." Siva and Sakli in other words stand ,  for prakiisa and vimada i.e. Light of Consciousness and its  awareness. According to this interpretation the translation of  the above verse would stand thus:  

"Having fixed one's mind inwardly on the union of Siva and  Sakti,5 and seated with eyes closed, gradually with the stability  of the mind, one discerns what is most eminently discernible."  

NOTES  

1. 'On the interior means 'on the Light that is ever present  inside'.  

2. 'With eyes closed' means 'detached from the external  world and completely introverted.'  

3. The mind is, at first, very fickle, but by constant practice,  it acquires stability and then one can concentrate with stead i nes ...  

4. This means that one becomes aware of the Highest  spiritual Reality.  

By this practice, the sense of difference gradually  diminishes; and one begins to view the entire universe as an  expression of Siva.  

This dharalJii comes under Saktopaya.

TRANSLA nON  

The medial niir/,il is situated in the middle. It is as slender as  the stem of a lotus. If one meditates on the inner vacuity of this  nOr/I, it helps in revealing the Divine.2  

NOTES  

1. Niitji here means the 'priiIJic channel'.  

2. PriiIJasakti exists in Su~umnii or the medial niitji. If one  meditates on the inner vacuity existing in this medial niieli the  priiIJa and apiina currents get dissolved in the Su~umnii, the udiina  current becomes active. Thus the kUIJtjalinl rises, passes through  su~umnii, and piercing the various centres of energy (cakras),  finally merges in Sahasriira. There the yogi experiences spiritual  light with which he feels identified. This is what is meant by  saying that the Divine is revealed by the aid of the interior  priiIJic force residing ·in S~umnii. The same idea has been  expressed in the following verse of Spandakiirikii:  

Tadii tasmin mahiivyomni pralinasasibhiiskare.  

Sau~uptapadavanmiitjha~ prabuddha~ syiidaniivrta~.  (Verse 25)  

When the moon (apiinacurrent of vital energy) and sun (priiIJa  current of vital energy) get dissolved and the yogi enters the  Su~umnii, the yogi who is after supernormal powers becomes  befuddled like one who is fast asleep, but the one who is not  under such an influence is wide awake and experiences spiritual  Light.  

This begins with AlJava upiiya and ends in Siiktopiiya.

Kara1)a is thus defined Kara1)fJ11I dehasanniveJa-v;se/-·  iitmii mudriidivyiipiirab. i.e. 'disposition of the limbs of the body  in a particular way, usually known as Mudra i.e. control of  certain organs and senses that helps in concentration'. Here the  

kara1)a specified is by means of the hands. The ten fingers of the  two hands are used in this mudrii. The ears are closed with the  two thumbs: the eyes are closed with the index fingers: the two  nostrils are closed with the two middle fingers; the mouth is  Closed with the ring-fingers and the little fingers. This is what is  meant by saying "By stopping (the openings of the sense) with  the weapon in the form of the hands." The openings of all the  jiiiinendriyas or organs of sense are closed.  

By this device consciousness is closed to all e~terior influences.  and the vital energy is confined within.  

2. The vital energy, by closing the various openings of the  senses, rises up towards the centre of the eye-brows and reach-

34 Vijiianabhairava  

ing there ruptures the knot or tangle of nerves in which a very  significant energy is locked up.  

3. When the centre of the eye-brows is ruptured by the  vital energy that rises up from within, a point of brilliant light  is perceived. This is the bindu or vindu which means a dot, a  globule, a drop, a point. It is written both as bindu and vindu.  

4. As soon as the bindu is perceived, the yogi has to concen trate on it. When the concentration develops, the bindu begins  to disappear gradually and finally vanishes in the ether of  universal consciousness (cidiikiisa). This is said to be paramii  sthitilt, the highest state of the yogi.  

There are five stages in this dhiira~ii, viz. (1) dviira-rodhanQT(l  or stopping the openings of the senses with the fingers of the  two hands, (2) bhrubhedalt-by closing the openings of the senses,  the vital energy that is pent up within rises to the centre of the  eye-brows, and ruptures the tangle of nerves situated in that  centre; (3) bindudarsanam - when the centre of the eye-brows is  pierced by the vital energy, then a bindu or point of light that  is imprisoned within it is released and the yogi perceives it men

ciousness, the yogi realizes the highest state, that is to say, in  that is revealed the essential nature of Bhairava.  

Svami Lak~malJa Joo, however, gives a different interpretation  of this dhiira~ii. He maintains that bhriibhedat is Iyab/ope  paiicaml which means 'after having ruptured the tangle of  nerves in the m.iddle of the eye-brows'. This is to be achieved by  concentration on the central spot of the eye-brows. When this  is effected, a drop of light will be visible there. After achieving  this result, the openings of the senses have to be blocked by the  above mudrii, then p'.ii~a sakli will arise in the sUlumnii which  will mount up towards Brahmarandhra. This will hasten the  dissolution of the drop of light in Brahmarandhra and in that  

. state the yogi will realize his essential Self. This is an ii~ava  upiiya ending in siiktopiiya.

TRANSLATION  

The yogi should meditate either in the heart or in dvadasanta1  on the bindu which is a subtle spark of fire resembling a tilaka2  produced by pressure on the dhama or teja (light existing in the  eyes).3 By such practice the discursive thought (vikalpa) of the  yogi disappears, and on its disappearance, the yogI is absorbed  in the light of supreme consciousness.  

NOTES  

1. The word sikhanta (end of the tuft of hair on the head)  here means dl'adasanta or brahmarandhra.  

2. Tilaka-a small round dot of sandalwood paste applied  on the forhead by the Hindus as a mark of devotion to a deity.  3. When the eyes are pressed, certain sparks appear. The  yogi should mentally seize the bindu (point) which is one of the  sparks appearing in the eye by pressure, and should meditate  on that bindu either in the heart or dvadasanta. By this practice,  his habit of dichotomising thought (vika/pa) will disappear, and  when that disappears, he will be established in the essential  nature of Bhairava.  

The word dhama in this context means the light in the eye, or  the word dhama may be interpreted as the subtle sparks of  light of a lamp that appear at the time of the extinction of its  light.

drule) attains to Brahman (brahmiitihigacchali).  

NOTES  

1. There is a double entendre in nii1.lata. It means both well versed and well bathed (ni-snata) i.e. deeply steeped.  2. Anahala niida literally means unstruck sound. It is a sound  that goes on vibrating within spontaneously without any impact.  About ten such kinds of niida (sound) that vibrate within grow ing subtler and subtler are referred to in books on Yoga. Here  the reference is to the subtlest niida that vibrates in prdQasakti  present in srqumna. Prioa§aktiis, in the universe, representative  of parasakti, the sakti of Parama Siva. It is the eternal energy  of consciousness. the spiritual spanda.  

When KW:'lflalinl rises, one is able to hear this. The yogI has  to concentrate on this sound which is at first like that of a hand bell, then subtler like that of a flute, then subtler still like that of  vl1.la, and then subtler like that of the buzz of a bee. When the  yogi concentrates on this nada, he forgets everything of the exter nal world, is gradually lost in the internal sound and is finally  absorbed in cidakiisa i.e. in the vast expanse of consciousness.  This is what is meant by saying that he attains to Brahman. This  kind of yoga is' known as var1.la in A1.Iava upiiya of Saiva yoga,

as nOdanusandhiina in some of the older uptl1liiads and Niitha  tradition, and surat; labda yoga in Kabira and other mediaeval  saints.

The usual practice in the recitation of Auria is contemplation  of ardhacandra. bindu, etc. upto unmanii after. the protracted  phase. In the present verse, Bhairava is referring to a different  practice. He says that at the end of the protracted phase of the  recitation, do not contemplate over ardhacandra, bindu, etc., but38 Vijiianabhairava  

over JUnya or void. Sunya or void here means free of all  external or internal objective support, of all tattvas, and of all  residual traces of kleSas. Gross objects like jar, cloth etc. are  external support of the mind, pleasure, pain, etc. are the internal  support of the mind, and residual traces are the vasanas of avidya,  asmita, raga, dve/a and abhinivesa.  

Siinya or voi(! means that which is free of the above conditions.  In other words, the mind has to be made nirvikalpa, free of all  vikalpas, of all thoughts.  

3. The most eminent energy of the void is the energy of the  parasakti.  

4. Attaining the \IOid means attaining the nature of Bhairava,  which is free of difference, duality and vikalpa.

NOTES  

1. The resonance of musical notes lasts for a long time and  being melodious it attracts the attention of the listener. Even  when it stops, it still reverberates in the mind of the listener.  The listener becomes greatly engrossed in it. A musical note,  if properly produced, appears to arise out of eternity and finally  to disappear in it.  

2. When the music stops, it still vibrates in the memory.  If the yogi does not allow his mind to wander to something else,  but concentrate on the echo of the music, he will be absorbed  in the source of all sound, viz; pariiviik and thus will acquire the  nature of Bhairava.

NOTES  

1. Ucciira here does not mean uttering or muttering but  moving upward from gross utterance, to subtle spandana  tvibration) and finally to mental reflection.  

2. Pitlt/amantra is that in which each letter is separately  arranged andin-which usually there is a connecting vowel at the  end. Aum is pitlt/amantra, Naviitma or the following mantra  consisting of nine letters is a pitlt/amantra.

When by this process the yogi's mind finally  attains to unmanii, he becomes identified with Siva.  Taking the mantra aum for example, Sivopadhyaya in his  commentary shows how its recitation points to the mounting  of priitlaJakti step by step from the navel upto dviidaSiinta.  'A' ('1') of Au,;, has to be contemplated onin the navel, 'U'(W)  in the heart i.e. the centre, '1Jl' (~) in the mouth (or according  to some in the palate or roof of the mouth), bindu in the centre  of the eye-brows, ardhacandra in the forehead, nirodhinl in the  upper part of the forehead, niida in the head, niidiinta in  Brahmarandhra, sakti in the skin, vyiipinl in the root of the iikhii  (tuft of hair on the top of the head), samanii in the sikhii, and  unmanii in the top of the iikhii.

NOTES  

This verse points to three stages of the yogI.

Lastly, if this tendency is prolonged, he  enters the state of Bhairava who is above all vikalpas, whose  very nature is nirvikalpa (nirvikalrasvarupabhak).

1. The word hrt or heart does not mean the physical heart.  It means the central spot in the body above the diaphragm. It  is an etheric structure resembling lotus, just as the physical  heart resembles a lotus.

2. The lotus is like two hemispherical bowls blended into one. Sivopidhyiya says in his commentary that the upper bowl  of the heart lotus represents pramiitIQ or knowledge and the  lower bowl represents prameya or object.

In the body the dvadasantas (a distance of 12  fingers) are from the navel to the heart, from the heart to the  throat, from the throat to the forehead and from the  forehead to the top of the cranium.

1. Kaligni Rudra is the universal destroyer. The aspirant  should imagine that his whole body is being burnt by the flames  of Kiligni Rudra. The idea is that all the impurities that are  due to the limitation of the body have to be destroyed by Kiligni  Rudra who destroys all impurities. sins. etc.  

2. Kiilapada is a technical term for the toe of the right foot.  3. By this practice. the aspirant feels that his impurities have  been burnt away and thus he experiences his essential Self which  is all peace and joy.

If the yogi thinks deeply that the subtle and subtler constitutive  principles of one's own body or of the world are being absorbed  in their own respective causes,l then at the end, para devi or the  supreme goddess is revealed.2  

NOTES  

1. This verse refers to the technique of vyapti or fusion by  which the gross tattva (constitutive principle of manifestation)  is reabsorbed into the subtle, the subtle into the subtler, the  subtler into the subtlest, e.g. the paRca-mahabhUtas-the five  gross material principles are to be contemplated as being  absorbed into the tanmatriis (primary subtle elements of  perception), ) the tanmatras into aharnkara (the I or ego-making  principle), this into buddhi, this again into prakrti and so on till  all are finally reabsorbed into Sadasiva. Then Sakti or what has  been designated as para devi (the supreme goddess) is revealed.  This kind of vyiipti or fusion which has been described in this  verse is known as iitmavyiipti.  

There is another stage of vyiipti, known as Sivavyiipti which  will be described in verse 57.  

2. At the appearance of parii devi, the entire cosmos appears  as nothing but the expression of that universal Divine Energy.  Everything is surrendered unto Her and the sen~e of difference  disappears.  

This verse refers to Siiktopaya.

TRANSLA nON  

If priilJasakti which is gross and thick, is made frail and subtle  (by yogic discipline; -particularly priilJiiyiima) and if a yogi  meditates on such sakt; either in dviidasiinta or in the heart ( i.e.  the centre of the body) by entering mentally into it, he is  liberated and he gains his (natural) sovereign power.  

NOTES  

The reading of the last line as given by Abhinavagupta in  Tantraloka (A XV, verses 480-81) is different. It is suptal;z  sl'iicchandyam iipnuyiit. K~emaraja reads the last line in  Spandanirvaya (p. 56) as svapnasviitantryam iipnuyiit which is  practically the same as Abhinavagupta's.  

According to Svami Lak~mal)a Joo, the traditional interpreta tion of this verse is the following:  

Plniim indicates that the breath has to be inhaled or exhaled  in a gross way i. e. with sound and durbaliim indicates that the  inhalation or exhalation has to be done slowly. According to  the above reading the meaning of the verse would be "If the  yogI practises breathing (both inhalation and exhalation) with  

sound and slowly meditating in dviida§iinta and in the heart  (centre), goes to sleep, he will acquire the freedom to control his  dream i.e. he will have only the dream that he desires to have."  This is AlJava upiiya leading to Siimbhava state.

BhuvanadhvadirupeQa cintayet kramaso'khiIam /  Sthiilasiik~maparasthitya yavadante manolayal}. //56.  

TRANSLATION  

One should contemplate step by step on the whole universe  under the form of bhuvana and other adhvas1.(courses) as being  dissolved successively from the gross state into the subtle and  from the subtle state into the supreme state till finally one's mind  is dissolved in Cinmatra (pure consciousness).2  

NOTES  

I. According to Trika philosophy the whole universe consist ing of subjective and objective aspects is a proliferation of the  svatantrya sakti or paravak under six forms known as  iar/adhva which means six routes or courses (!iat=six) adhva  

= route, course). Three of them are under the viicaka (indi cator) sid~ which is the subjective or grahaka aspect of  manifestation ; the other three are under the vacya, the indi cated or objective side.  

At the level of paravak, vacaka and vacya, sabda and artha,  word and object are in a state of indistinguishable unity. In  manifestation, these begin to differentiate. The first adhva or  step of this differentiation is the polarity of var~a and kala. Var~a  at this stage, does not mean letter, or colour, or class. It means  a measure index of the function-form associated with the object,  and kala means an aspect of creativity. Var~a is the function 

form and kala is predicable. This is the first adhva of the  polarisation of paravak. This adhva is known as para  (supreme) or abheda, for at this stage, there is no difference  between var~a or kala, the creative aspect.  

The next adhva or step in the creative descent is the polarity  of mantra and tatlva. This level of creativity is known as  para para or bhedabheda (identity in difference) or sukima  (subtle). Mantra is the basic formula of tattva: tattva is  the principle or source and origin of the subtle structural  forms.  

The third and final polarity is that of patia and bhuvana. This  level of manifestation is known as that of apara (inferior) or 

52 Vijiiiinabhairava  

bheda (total difference between the viicaka and viicya) or sthUla  (gross). Bhuvana is the universe as it appears to apprehending  centres like ourselves. Pada is the actual formulation of that  universe by mind reaction and speech.  

The trika or triad on the viicaka side is known as kiiliidhvii  i.e. of temporal order, and the trika or triad on viicya side is  known as desiidhvii or of spatial order.  

The ~atladhvii may be arranged in the following tabular  form :- 

V ACAKA OR SABDA  

The sUbjective order; the  temporal order, phonematic  manifestation.  

Para or abheda level.  

Para para or bhedabheda  

VaI'Qa  

VACYA OR ARTHA  

The objective order; the  spatial order; cosmo gonic  manifestation.  

kala  

or siik!?ma level.  

Apara or bheda or sthula  level.  

Mantra tattva  pada bhuvana  

Of these, each preceding adhvii is vyiipaka i.e., pervasive,  inhering (in the succeeding one) and each succeeding adhvii is  vyiipya i.e. capable of being pervaded by the preceding one. So  there is vyiipyavyiipaka relationship among these.  

2. The dhiirafJii or the yogic practice recommended here is  that the yogi should practise the bhiivanii or imaginative con templation of the succeeding gross (sthUla) adhvii being dissolv ed in the preceding· subtle (suk~ma) adhvii. The gross (sthula)  manifestation, viz., pada and bhuvana should be earnestly imagin ed as being dissolved in their preceding subtle (suk~ma) origins,  viz., mantra and tattva; mantra and tattva, the subtle adhvii,  should in turn, be earnestly imagined as being dissolved in  their preceding supreme (para) origin varfJa and kalii. Finally  these should be imagined as being dissolved in pariiviika or  pariisakti, and pariiv(ik in ,~iva i.e. cinmiitra or vijiiiina (pure  consciousness) which alone is Bhairava or the ultimate Divine  principle. 

Vijniinabhairava 53  

Krama.rab in the verse means step by step, i.e. the first step  should consist of the practice of the bhiivanii of the stMla or  gross manifestation being dissolved into the subtle (suklma)  one. When by sufficient practice of this bhiivanii, the yogi is  fully convinced that this solid seeming world (bhuvana) and  gross speech (pad a) are only an appearance of a much subtler  process of mantra and tattva, he should take the next step which  would consist of the bhiivanii of the subtle (suklma) mantra and  tattva as being dissolved into the supreme (para) aspects of  var~a, kalii, and so on.  

'when the yogi has sufficiently practised the bhiivanii of the  dissolution of the entire manifestation into cit or vijniina, he  will attain to the plane of Bhairava and his manas or citta will  be automatically dissolved into cit (pure consciousness). This  is known as laya bhiivanii (creative contemplation pertaining to  dissolution). This ascent to the Divine is known as iiroha or  adhyiiroha krama, the process of ascent. The 13th sUlra of  Pratyabhijiiiihrdayam expressly says that citta finally becomes  citi. This is known as cittapralaya or the dissolution of the  empirical individual mind into the Divine.  

The difference between this dhiira~ii and dhiira~ii No. 30 in  verse 54 consists in the fact that the dhiira~ described in verse  54 leads the yoge only upto the subtle sakti where parii de vi  reveals Herself, but this leads the yogi upto the utmost plane of  Siva where the individual mind completely dissolves into the  universal consciousness. In verse 54, the aim was the  realization of the Supreme Power that is the source of the gross  manifestation of the universe. In verse 56, the emphasis is on  the transformation of the individual consciousness by its  dissolution into the universal Divine Consciousness (Manolaya or  cittapralaya). So, this is Siiktopiiya leading to Siimbhava state.

TRANSLATION  

If one meditates on the Saiva tattval (which is the quintes sence) of this entire universe on all sides and to its last limits by  the technique of ~ac;ladhva2 he will experience great awakening.8  

NOTES  

1. Siva is both praJciisa and vimarśa, both the light of  Consciousness and the consciousness or awareness of that  consciousness. Saiva tattva is the svariipa or essential nature of  Siva. Meditating on Saiva tattva means meditating on the svarUpa  (own form, essential nature) of Siva who is both prakiiSa and  vimarśa.  

2. The sa~adhvii has two sides- Viieaka and viieya. The  viieaka ·side-var~a, mantra and pada are an expression of  prakiiSa, the viieya side-kalii tattva, and bhuvana are an  expression of vimarśa.  

In the previous dhiira~ii No. 32 in verse 56, the technique of  the sa~adhvii was .used for tracing back the entire universe of  subjects and objects to its source, th~ Central Reality. Here the  technique of sa~adhvii is to be used for realizing the svariipa or  essential nature of this Central Reality. The technique of sat/adhvii  is incomplete if it simply ends in re-integrating the universe to  its source. It has still to realize the saiva tattva, the nature of  the Central Reality which is both prakiisa and vimarśa in one  and the source of both the viicaka and viieya of the sa~adhvii.  

Again in dhiira~ii No. 30 (verse 54), the technique of tracing  back the constitutive principles was used for iitmavyiipti, for the  fusion of manifestation into the essential Self which, according  to the Trika system, is a lower ideal. Atmavyiipti emphasizes  prakiisa which does not necessarily include the universe. In verse  57, the ideal of realization that is emphasized is Siva-vyiipti.  fusion into Siva who is both prakiiSa and vimarśa. It is the  Reality that is inclusive of the universe. In this realization, the  universe is not negated but seen sub specie eternitatis. under the 

VijRanabhairava 55  

form of the Eternal, as an expression of the vimaria aspect of  Siva.  

3. This great awakening is the realization of the svarupa or  essential nature of Siva who is both prakiiSa and vimarśa.  

The difference between the previous dharal',la (in verse 56) and  this one (verse 57) lies in the fact that in the previous dharal',la  the dissolution of both the oQjective and sUbjective order was to  be contemplated one by one successively (kramaia~) i.e. first the  dissolution of the gross into the subtle, and then of the subtle  into the supreme, whereas in the present dharal',la (verse 57) the  dissolution of the entire world (asya sarvasya viSvasya) has to be  contemplated simultaneously and integrally into Siva tall va. As  Sivopadhyaya puts it, Bhuvanadiadhvaparyante!u jagata~ Sivat  vina no kindt iti jagad rupam tyaktva, iivameva dhyayato mahodaya~  syat. The reality of this world is nothing apan from Siva.  Therefore this world should be viewed not as the world ( i.e. as  something different from Siva) but as the modality of Sh·a.  Therefore it is Siva alone who has to be contemplated On. Thus  there will be mahodaya i.e. great spiritual Awakening. This  dharal',la is Saktopaya.

A yogI should cast his eyes in the empty space inside a jar or  any other object leaving aside the enclosing partitions. His mind  will in an instant get absorbed in the empty space (inside the jar)  When his mind is absorbed in that empty space, he should  imagine that his mind is absorbed in a total void. He will then  realize his identification with the Supreme.  

NOTES  

Casting one's gaze into the empty space inside a jar is a device  for preparing the mind for getting absorbed in total void. When  the mind is absorbed in the empty space of the jar, the aspirant  should imagine that the empty space has extended into a total  void. Thus his mind will be absorbed in the absolute void i.e.  Siva.

One should cast his gaze on a region in which there are no  trees, on mountain, on high defensive wall l His mental state  being without any support will then dissolve and the fluctua tions of his mind will cease.2  

NOTES  

1. The idea is that when the mind dwells on a vast vacant  space, then being without the support of any definite concrete  object, the mind gets absorbed in that void.  

2. When the mind is absorbed in a vast open space, its  vikalpas or thought-constructs come to a dead stop. That is the  moment when the Light within makes its presence felt and the  aspirant realizes that there is a deeper Reality than what is open  to the senses.  

Abhinavagupta quotes the first line of this verse in his  Paratrirpsika (on p. 136) and confirms that, in such a moment,  there is· Bhairavabodhiinupravesa (entry into Bhairava consciousness).  

This type of fixed gaze into vast vacant space without any  thought-construct or objective support for the mind is known  as dmibandhanabhiivanii. As there is neither meditation nor  

japa (recitation of mantra), nor any meditation involved in this  dhiiraIJii, this is Siimbhava upiiya.

At the moment when one has perception or knowledge of two  objects or ideas, one should simultaneously banish both per ceptions or ideas and apprehending the gap or interval between  the two, should mentally stick to it (i.e. the gap). In that gap  will Reality flash forth suddenly.  

NOTES  

The reading jniitvii instead of dhyiitvii has been adopted  by Jayaratha in Tantriiloka I, p. 127. This reading gives better  sense.  

The above is Siikta upiiya. Our mind is always caught up in  perceptions or ideas. Weare prisoners of our own ideas. Behind  all the activities ofthe mind lies Reality which gives life to our  mental activity. That Reality cannot be viewed as an object, for  it is the Eternal Subject and ground of all experience. If we do  not allow our mind to be carried away by the perceptions or  ideas succeeding each other incessantly but rather let our mind  dip in the gap between the two perceptions or ideas without  thinking of any thing. we will, to our surprise, be bathed in that  Reality which can never be an object of thought.  

This is known as nirii/amba bhiivanii or creative contempla tion without any object as support for the mind. This verse has  been quoted as an example of nirii/amba bhiivanii in Netra  Tantra (pt.I.p.201). This is also Sunya bhiivanii-an example of  the mind sounding its plummet in the depth of the void.  

The sudden flash of Reality by this practice has been designat ed unme~a or opening out in Spanda-Kiirikii. Abandonment  of the two perceptions or ideas that precede and succeed the  gap is known as anii/ocana or non-observation. The two ideas  have not to be pushed aside by effort but have to be abandon ed by a smooth, gentle non-observation. This is a very  important and unfailing dhiira1;lii for the grasp of Reality or  nature of Bhairava.

NOTES  

The previous dhiiralJii advises the aspirant to reject two  positive objects, perceptions or thoughts (ubhayor bhiivayob)  and contemplate on the middle i.e. the gap between the two.  In the present dhiiralJii, the ilspirant is advised to contemplate  on the middle or gap between one positive bhiiva or object and  another negative bhava i.e. another bhiiva which the aspirant has  not allowed to arise in the mind. This is the main difference  between the two dhiiralJiis. The result is the same, viz.; the  emergence of the essential Self or the nat!lre of Bhairava.

60 Vijiiiinabhairava  

The following commentary of Jayaratha leaves no room for  doubt that the above verse of Abhinavagupta refers to t~e two  dhiir01:ziis mentioned in Verse No. 61 and 62 of Vijiiiinabhairava.  

"The middle state i.e. the gap between two positive objects or  between one positive and another negative object is siinya or  void which is the ground of the determination of both. In him  who apprehends that void and abandoning simultaneously both  positive perceptions or positive and negative perceptions fixes  his atten~on on that alone arises that stability in the Highest  Self (paramiitmani) who is the highest objective and who is full  of the ambrosia of Siva. In confirmation of the above expla 

nation Jayaratha quotes the verses 61 and 62 of Vijiiiina bhairava.  

Like the previous one, this dlzar01;zii is also Siiktopiiya.  The reading adopted by the text printed in the Kashmir  Series is bhiive nyakte, which means 'when the mind is fixed on  an object which was never seen previously like Siva with three  eyes, Vip:zu with four arms'. Bhiil'e tyakte is, however, a better  and more authentic reading as is evident from Jayaratha's  commentary quoted above.

K~emaraja has quoted this verse in Siva-Sutra vimadini at  two places, in I, 18, and III, 39.  

According to Svimi Lak~aoa Joo, the word 'va' occurring  in this verse should not be taken in the sense 'or' but in the  sense of 'ca' i.e. 'and' (samuccaya).

o gazzelle-eyed one, by the employment of magic, supreme  delight arises (in the heart of the spectator) instantaneously. (In  this condition of the mind), Reality manifests itself.  

NOTES  

When a spectator beholds some wonderful magical perform ance, his ordinary normal consciousness is raised to a plane  where there is no distinction between subject and object, where  it is freed of all thought-constructs and is filled with reverential  awe, with mute wonder and ineffable joy. At that plane of  consciousness is revealed the essential nature of Bhairava. This  is only one example. When by contemplating on any scene-vast,  awe-inspiring, deeply moving, the mind is thrown into ecstasy  and mute wonder, it passes into nirvikalpa state, then that is  the moment when suddenly .and instantaneously Supreme  Reality reveals itself.  

This is an example of Sakta upaya.  

According to Svami Lak!Jmaoa Joo, this verse can have  another meaning also. The word 'kuhana' also means 'tickling  the arm-pit'. So the verse would mean, "0 gazelle-eyed one, by  tickling the arm-pit, there occurs instantaneously a great joy. If  one contemplates over the essential nature of joy, Reality  manifests itself."

64 VijiUinabhairava  TRANSLATION  

When by stopping the opening of all the senses the current  of all sensory activity is stopped, the pro1;lasakti moves slowly  upward (in the middle nor/lor sU$umnii from muliidhara towards  Brahmarandhra), then in the upward movement of pro1;lasakti,  there is felt a tingling sensation (at the various stations in the  middle nor/i) like the One created by the movement of an ant  (over the body). At the moment of that sensation, there ensues  supreme delight.  

NOTES  

The main point in this dhiiraIJo is that when priiIJasakti moves  upward, there is the awakening of KUIJr/alinl which moves up ward towards dviidasiinta i.e. towards Brahmarandhra. This slow  and gradual movement of prii1)asakti or of kUl;zr/alini gives a  sensation like that of the movement of an ant over the body.  This sensation at the time of the ant-like movement of priilJa sakti is very pleasant.  

Sivopadhyaya says that the upward movement of priiIJasakti  can be achieved by kumbhaka priiIJoyiima. He quotes Pataiijali's  Yoga-sutras (II,49-50) which say that priilJa can be made dirgha 

suk$ma (prolonged and subtle) by kumbhaka pro1)iiyiima (restraint  of breath). This would be oIJava upiiya. But Pataiijali does  not refer to KUI)Qalini yoga. Sivopadhyii's quotation from  Patafijali in this context is irrelevant.  

What the dhiiraIJii actually means to say is that when the  openings of all the senses are stopped and the mind is kept free  of all thought-constructs (nirl'ika/pa) the priiIJasakti, becomes  active in the su~umno, and as the kUlJr/alini rises slowly towards  Brahmarandhra, one feels like the sensation of an ant creeping  over the body. At that time, the yogi experiences the movement  of kUlJr/alini from one station to another and is overjoyed.

TRANSLATION  

One should throw (i.e. concentrate) the delightful cilia in the  middle of vahni and vila bothways whether by itself Of permeat ed by viiyu (prii~ic breath), one would then be joined to the  bliss of sexual union.  

NOTES  

Vahni and vila are technical terms of this yoga. Vahni stands  for sankoca (contraction) by the entrance of prii~a (in me~hra kanda which is near the root of the rectum), Vila connotes  vikiisa or expansion. Vah"i refers to adha~ ku~~alinl, and vila  to urdhvaku~~alinl. Ordhva ku~~linl is the condition when the  prii~a and apiina enter the sUlumnii and the ku~~alinl !ises up.  Ku~~al;nl is a distinct sakt; that lies folded up in three and a half  valayas or folds in MUliidhiira. When she rises from one-three fourths of the folds, goes up through sUiumnii, crosses Lambika  and pierces Brahmarandhra, she is known as Ordhva ku~~alinl.  and this pervasion of hers is known as vikiisa or vila.  

Adha~ ku~~alinl-Its field is from Lambika down to one three-fourth of the folds of kUIJ4alinllying folded in the millii dhiira. PraJ"la goes down in adha~ k~~/inl from Lambika  towards mu!iidhiira.  

The entrance of prii~a into adha~ ku~~a1inl is sailkoca or  vahni; rising into urdhva ku~¢alinl is vikiisa or vila. Vahni is  symbolic of priil,la viiyu and vila of apiina viiyu. Entering into  the root, middle and tip of adhab ku~~alini is known as vahni  or sailkoca. Vahni is derived from the root vah-to carry. Since  prii~a is carried down up to mUliidhiira in this state, it is called  vahni.  

The word vila does not mean poison here. It is derived from  the root vii 'to pervade.' Vila, therefore, refers to prasara or  vikiisa (expansion).  

When the priil,la and apiina enter the SUIUmniij the citta or the  indi vidual consciousness should be stopped or suspended 

66 Vij nanabhairava  

between the vahni and vi1a or in othe(. words between the adhal)  kU1J(!alinl and the urdhva kucr(!alinl.  

Vayupurcra or full of vayu means that the citta should be res trained in such a way that vayu may neither pass out through  the nostrils nor through the male organ and the anus. Citta and  vayu are inter-connected. Restraint of the one brings about the  restraint of the other.  

Smarananda or bliss of sexual union : When the citta can be  restrained between the adhal) and urdhva kucrtJalinl, one has the  joy of sexual union. This is inverted union. Sexual union is  external; this union is internal.  

This dharacra is Acrava upaya.

At the time of sexual intercourse with a woman, an absorp tion into herl is brought about by excitement, and the final  delight that ensues at orgasm betokens the delight of Brahman.  This delight is (in reality) that of one's own Self.  

NOTES  

1. This absorption is only symbolic of the absorption in the  Divine Energy. This illustration has been given only to show  that the highest delight ensues only at the disappearance of  duality. Sivopadhyaya quotes a verse which clarifies the esoteric  meaning of this union.

"Just as being locked in embrace with a woman, one is totally  dissolved in the feeling of one-ness (unity) and one loses all sense  of anything external or internal, even so when the mind is dissolved  in the Divine Energy, one loses all sense of duality and  experiences the delight of unity-consciousness. The Sruti (scrip 

ture) speaks of the union with a woman only to illustrate the  union with the Divine. It is only a fool who takes this illustra tion as an injunction for carnal pleasure.  

2. The delight is that of one's own Self. It does not come  from any external source. The woman is only an occasion for  the manifestation of that delight.

Since the sexual pleasure is obtained simply by memory even  in the absence of a woman, it is evident that the delight is inherent  within. It is this delight apart from any woman that one should  meditate on in order to realize the bliss of the divine consciousness.  This dhiira1)ii is Siiktopiiya. .

When the yogi mentally becomes one with the incomparable  joy of song and other objects, then of such a yogi, there is, be cause of the expansion of his mind, identity with that (i.e. with  the incomparable joy) because he becomes one with it.  

NOTES  

In verses 69-73, Bhairava says that one can turn even a sen·  suous joy into a means of yoga. In the above verses examples of  all sorts of sensuous joy have been given. Joy of sexual inter course is an example of the pleasure of spada (contact); joy at  the sight of a friend is an example of the pleasure of rupa (visual  perception); joy of delicious food is an example of rasa (taste);  joy derived from song is an example of the pleasure of sound  (sabda).  

In each of these, the emphasis is on the meditation of the  source of the joy which is spiritual. Leaving aside the various  sensuous media, the aspirant should meditate on that fountain  of all joy which only trickles in small drops in all the joys of  life.  

In verses 69-72, the examples given are only those of physical  delight. In verses 73, the main example is of aesthetic rapture  that one feels in listening to a mefodious song. According to  Saiva aesthetics, there can be aesthetic rapture only when the 

70 Vijiianabhairava  

person experiencing that rapture has samid-viSranti i.e. when his  mind is withdrawn from everything around him and reposes in  his essential Self. Aesthetic delight is, therefore, a greater source  of the experience of the spiritual Self.  

This is Saktopaya leading to Sambhava state.

2. One has to plunge in the source of the delight. One will  then find that it is the Divine, the Essential Self of aU.  This is Saktopaya.

NOTES  

1. The intermediate state between sleep and waking is the  nirvikalpa state, i. e. a state in which all thought-constructs  have disappeared. This is the turiya or transcendental state of  consciousness.  

2. By concentrating on this thought-free state of conscious ness, one will have an experience of the essential nature of Self  which transcends all thought-constructs. Thus one will have an  experience of the divine nature. It is this Divine nature which  has been called para devi, the Supreme Goddess.

TRANSLATION  

At the moment of the (intuitive) perception (of the universe),  there is manifested the supreme attainment through the Karan ki1)I, Krodhanii, Bhairavi, Lelihiinii and Khecarl mudriis.  

NOTES  

DUII-kiile is explained by Svami Lak~maoa Joo as 'on the  occasion of the yogic practice.' Mudrii (posture) is a technical  term meaning a particular disposition and control of the organs  of the body as a help in concentration. It is called mudrii because  it gives the joy of spiritual consciousness.  

Karanki~l mudrii is so-called, because by it the yogi views the  world as mere karanka or skeleton. It views the physical body  as dissolved in the highest ether. It is the mudrii of jiiiina-sid dhas i.e. of those who have become perfect in jRiina or spiritual  insight.  

Krodhanii is a mudrii expressive of krodha or anger. It assumes  a tense, tight posture. It gathers up all the twentyfour tattvps from  the earth upto prakrti into the corpus of mantra. It is the mudrii  of mantra-siddhas i.e. of those who have become perfect in  mantra.  

Bhairavi mudriiconsists in keeping the eyes fixed externally with- 'out blinking but making the gaze turned towards the inner Reality. 

Vijiianabhairava 73  

It withdraws everything into the inner Self, and is the mudra of  the melapasiddhas. Melapa means the 'supernatural power of the  union of the energies of the various organs'. It also means the  meeting of the siddhas and Yogin;s. Those who have become  perfect in this matter are known as MeJapa-siddhas.  

Lelihana is the mudra in which the yogi tastes the entire  universe in his nature of essential I-consciousness. It is the mudra  of the Sakta-siddhas.  

Khecari literally means that which moves in the sky or empty  space. Kha or 'empty-space' is a symbol of consciousness.  There are four kinds of Khecari mudra. One kind is the mudra  referred to in Ha/ha-yoga-pradipika. It consists in turning the  tongue backward towards the palate inside the cranium. The  second kind is the one described by K~emaraja in Siva-Siitra 

vimarśinī under siitra 5 of the 2nd section.  

"A yogi should be seated in the padmasana (lotus posture)  erect like a stick and should then fix his mind on the navel and  should lead the mind up to kha-trayas or the three saktis (Sakti,  vyapini, and samana), situated in the space in the head. Holding  the mind in that state, he should move it forward with the above  triad. Putting himself in this condition, the great yogi acquires  movement in the head."  

The third kind of khecari is as described in Viveka-marta1J.t/.a.  "The tongue should be turned back inside the cranium. The gaze  should be directed towards the centre in between the eye-brows'.  

The fourth or the highest kind of Khecari mudra is that state  in which the yogi remains in Siva-consciousness all the while, in  which his consciousness moves in all beings.  

This is the mudra of the Sambhava-siddhas.  

This dhara1J.a is Sambhava upaya.

Owing to the introversion of the mind, he experiences great  peace which may give him a taste of divine bliss.

The traditional jRiina (spiritual insight) obtained through  human gurus (spiritual directors) is known as miinavaugha, that  obtained through siddhas (perfect masters who have gone beyond  human condition) is known as siddhaugha, and that obtained  through devas (gods) is known as divyaugha.

NOTES  

the dark  (terrible)  nature of  

Contemplation over darkness at dark night in the dark  fortnight has been recommended, because in such darkness,  distinct objects are not visible. So there is nothing to distract  the attention.  

When one contemplates over darkness for long, one is filled  with a sense of awe and uncanny mystery and easily slips into  the mystic consciousness. It is at such an hour that the Light  of Bhairava makes its appearance and one acquires the nature  of Bhairava.  

This is biihya timirabhiivanii or contemplation over external  darkness with open eyes. This dhiir~ii pertains to Siiktopiiya,

Similarly, (even during the absence of dark fortnight), the  aspirant should at first contemplate over terrible darkness in  front of him by closing his eyes, then later should contemplate  over the dark, terrible form of Bhairava in front with eyes wide  open. Thus will he become identified with Him.  

NOTES  

This verse points to the transition from nimilana to unmllana  samiidhi. If after the nimilana samiidhi, the aspirant goes into  unmilana samiidhi i.e. contemplates over the form of Bhairava  with eyes wide open, he will find his mind swallowed up in the  nature of Bhairava and will realize his identity with Him.

NOTES  

As the particular organ of sense is unable to establish contact  with the external world, there arises a feeling of vacuity in that  organ. Then the aspirant becomes introverted. He gets absorbed  in that void where the duality of subject and object does not  exist, and forthwith the essential Self of the aspirant is revealed.  This dhiira~ii pertains to Siiktopiiya.

If one recites the letter a without hindu or visarga then, 0  goddess, ParameSvara-a magnificent torrent of wisdom appears  suddenly.  

NOTES  

Bindu in this context indicates the anusviira or dot on a letter  which is the symbol of nasal pronunciation. Visarga indicates  two dots placed one upon the other immediately after a letter  which symbolize the articulation of a letter with l;z sound. Thus  'if (a) with hindu would be 'if' (aQl), and $f (a) with visarga would  be ar: (a1;1).  

In sounding 'a' with anusviira i. e. as flI1J there will be inhala tion (puraka) and in sounding 'a' with visarga i. e. as al;z there  will be exhalation (recaka). The above dhiira~ii says that the letter  lr 'a' should be recited without a hindu i. e. without an anusviira,  and also without a visarga (without the l;z sound) i. e. neither 

VijRdnabhairava 83  

with inhalation nor with exhalation (neither with puraka nor  with recaka). This implies that the letter 'a' (") should be recited  in a kumbhaka state i.e. in a state of the retention of the breath  as 'a' (,,).  

Svami Lak,maga Joo interprets kumbhakasthasya occurring in  the commentary in a different way. According to him kumbhakas thasya here means cakitamudrayibrJ 'sthitasya i.e. in the posture  of cakitamudra. In this posture, the mouth is wide open and the  tongue is held back. In this posture 'a' (81') can neither be recited  with anusvara nor With visarga. The aspirant will be automati cally compelled to contemplate over 'a' only mentally.  

In sounding 'a' with anusviira i.e. as am there will be inhala tion (pQraka, and in sounding 'a' with visarga i.e. as 'a\1', there  will be exhalation (recaka). The above dhara!la says that the  letter 81' (a) should be recited without a bindu i.e. without an  anusvara, and also without a visarga (without the ~ sound) i.e.  neither with inhalation nor with exhalation (neither with puraka,  nor with recaka). This implies that the letter 'a' (") should be  recited in a kumbhaka state i.e. in a state of the retention of the  breath as 'a' (81).  

Why of all letters has particularly 'a' (,,) been selected for  recitation ? The reason is firstly that the lettter 'a' (") is the  initial letter of the alphabet; it is the source and origin of all  other letters; it is neither generated out of any other letter, nor  is it dissolved in any other letter. Secondly, it symbolizes anuttara  the absolute, the state which is beyond description, the state in  which Siva and Sakti are in indistinguishable unity. The recitation  of 'a' (")' therefore, betokens the longing of the soul for Siva 

sakti-samarasya (the state ofthe harmonious fusion of Siva-sakti)  a nostalgia for its ultimate source.  

Thirdly 'a' (") represents aham, the perfect I-consciousness  of the Absolute. Therefore, the contemplation of a establishes  one in the absolute I-consciousness of Siva.  

Lastly the recitation of 'a' (") without anusviJra or visarga in  a kumbhaka state or in cakita mudra makes the mind nirvikalpaka  i.e. freed of all dichotomizing thought-constructs and suddenly  in this state appears Paramesvara (the highest Lord). the flood  of divine wisdom.  

This is A!lava upaya.

"Maya is delusive, the function of kala is limited activity  (of vldya, itis limited knowledge, etc)," considering the functions  of the various tattvas (constitutive principles) in this way, one  does not remain separate any longer.  

NOTES  

Abhinavagupta thus defines Mayasakti:  

"Sarvathaiva svariipaQl tirodhatte avrgute vimohini sa"  I.P.VI.I1, 17.  

''She veils the essential Self and thus proves delusive."  ,,~~ 'l'ffisEi;:alll'1lt4i'1Tf~ I

"The power of Maya shows itself in manifesting undiluted  diversity and in bringing about the identity of Self with the not Self such as siinya (void), buddni and the body."  

The yogi fully understands that Maya subjects everyone to  her charm. She brings about a sense of difference in life which  is essentially one whole, and through her kancukas (coverings).  viz. kala, vidya, raga, kala, and niyati, effects limitation in  respect of activity, knowledge, desire, time, causality and  space.  

Being fully aware of the limited functions of the tattvQS and  the delusive power of Maya, the yogi does not lose sight of the  wholeness of Reality and, therefore, does not cut himself adrift88 Vijniinabhairova  

from it. Rather by unmllana samiidhi, he views the entire mani festation as the expression of Siva and is thus chockful of a deep  sense of relatedness.  

If the reading Kalayan nii prthag bhavet is adopted, the  meaning would be "(such a) person (nii) becomes isobted  (prthak) and is established in his essential Self."

When the mind of the aspirant becomes introverted, and he  considers his essential Self as completely separate from desire  which is only a play of the mind which is not-self, then desires  dissolve in the mind even as waves rising on the surface of the  sea dissolve in the sea itself.  

If ~\Dother desire arises, the best means of putting an end to  the desire is to shift the attention from the desire to the under lying spiritual Reality, the creative moment between the two  desires, known as unme~a.

NOTES  

The desire, knowledge and activity of the ego are not the  desire, knowledge and activity of the essential Self. When the  aspirant realizes and practises the bhii'Vanii of the essential Self  who is always pure consciousness-bliss, he will rise above his  ego and will be dissolved in his essential Self.

When the mind is withdrawn from the object of desire.  knowledge, etc. and is fixed on the desire, knowledge as the  very Self, as a sakti of the divine, then the mind is rid of  vikalpas, and the aspirant has the realization of Reality.  This is Sambhava upaya.

All knowledge is without cause, without base and deceptive.  From the point of view of absolute Reality, this knowledge does  not belong to any person. When one is given wholly to this  contemplation, then, 0 dear one, one becomes Siva.  

NOTES  

This bhavana is the device for entering the heart i.e. the mystic  centre of reality.. Abhinavagupta designates it as Sarvatma sankoca in Tantriloka (V, 71) and Jayaratha in his commen tary, quotes this verse as an example of sarvatma-sankoca.  This consists in rejecting everything external and entering com pletely within oneself by means of nimllana samadhi-'ecstasy  with closed eyes.' The reality of every' object is rejected and also  its association with the subject (kasyacin naitad).  

In this way, bothjiiata (knower, subject) and jiieya (known,  object) are rejected. Only jiiana or vijiiana remains which is  Bhairava. Vijiiana is the base of everything subjective or objective  and that is the sole Reality.

The same Self characterized by consciousness is present in all  the bodies; there is no difference in it anywhere. Therefore, a  person realizing that everything (in essence) is the same (con.  sciousness) triumphantly rises above transmigratory existence.  

NOTES  

K~emariija has quoted this verse in his commentary on the  first sutra of Siva sutras and has aptly pointed out that caitanya  or consciousness does not mean simply jiiiina or knowledge but  also kriyii or autonomous activity.  

A person who realizes that the Self characterized by con sciousness is the same in all from Sadiisiva down to the tiniest  worm has become identified with that essential Self and  acquires the consciousness of samatii (essential oneness). He is,  therefore, liberated and is no longer subject to birth and death.  This is Siimbhavopiiya.

If one succeeds in immobilizing his mind (i.e. in making it

one-pointed) when he is under the sway of desire, anger, greed,  infatuation, arrogance and envy, then the Reality underlying  these states alone subsists.  

NOTES  

When an aspirant is under the domination of any strong  emotion, he should dissociate his mind from the object of the  emotion and concentrate deeply on the emotion itself, without  either accepting it or rejecting it. He should withdraw his mind  from everything external and turn it within even as a tortoise  withdraws its limbs within its shell on the occasion of a great  danger. When he is thus intensely introverted, the passion be 

comes calmed like a charmed snake; all vikalpas are shed like  leaves in autumn. Such abrupt introversion puts the aspirant in  contact with the infinite spiritual energy surging within known  as spanda and then he is filled with the bliss of divine conscious 

ness (cidiinanda). This means is known as iitma-sankoca or  sakti-sankoca. Thus even a strong passion may lead a cautious  yogi to spiritual bliss.  

This is Siimbhavopiiya.

After rejecting attachment to one's body, one should, with  firm mind and with a vision which has no consideration for  any thing else, contemplate thus, "I am everywhere". He will  then enjoy (supernal) happiness.  

NOTES  

In this dharalJa, there are'two main ideas, one negative and  another positive. The negative one is, "I am not my body, nor  am I confined to any particular place or time". The positive  one is, "I am everywhere." By this practice, one becomes  identified with Siva-sakti and acquires cosmic consciousness.  

In verse hundred, one has to practise the bhavana of cit or  consciousness in all bodies, in every form of existence. In the  present dharalJa, one has to practise the expansion of his own  consciousness in all forms of being.  

Sivopadhyaya points out in his commentary a further differ ence between the idea contained in verse 100 and the present one.  In the present verse, the bhavana recommended is sarvam idam  aham-"All this is myself" which is the paramar.sa or con sciousness of sadasiva or Isvara. In verse 100, it is cit or con sciousness as such whose omnipresence has been emphasized.  In other words, the plane referred to in verse 100 is that of Siva,  wherea:; the plane referred to in the present verse is that of  Sadasiva or 1 svara.

NOTES  

In this verse, iccha or desire has reference to action. This  verse points out the fact that jiiana and krlya are not the  monopoly only of the human being. They are universal i.e.  common to everything in the universe. This dharalJ,a suggests  that if one contemplates over the fact of knowledge and desire  being common to every existent in the universe, he will acquire  the consciousness of unity. Man usually thinks that there is  nothing common between him and a jar or a tree, but if he  comes to realize that jnana and kriya are the common  characteristics of all manifestation, that all are co-sharers of this  divine gift, he will shed his insularity and feel his kinship  with all.

The consciousness of object and subject is common to all the  embodied ones. The yogis have, however, this distinction that  they are mindful of this relation.  

NOTES  

The object is always related to the subject. Without this  relation to the subject, there is no such thing as an object.  Ordinary peoPle get lost in the object; they forget the Self, the  knower. The real knower is the witnessing awareness from which  the subject arises and in which it rests. The yogi is, however,  always mindful of that witnessing awareness which alone is the  subject of every thing, which is always a subject and never an  object.

Apek~aril svasarlrasya tyaktva vyapi dinair bhavet 11107  TRANS LA TION  

One should, leaving aside the need of his own body (in other  cases), contemplate that the (same) consciousness is present in  other bodies as in his own. Thus he will become all-pervasive  in a few days.  

NOTES  

A body is not necessary for thinking or for consciousness.  Everybody has an experience of consciousness apart from the  body. In dream, one has consciousness apart from the gross  body; in deep sleep, one has consciousness apart from the subtle  body (suk,ma-sarira); in the fourth state of experience (Iuriya)  one has consciousness apart from the causal body (kiiraIJa sarira).  

So it is clear that a body is not a necessary medium for conscious ness. Knowing this from his personal experience, the aspirant  should contemplate that his consciousness is not confined to his  own body, but is all-pervasive. Thus he will realize the all 

pervasiveness of consciousness which is the nature of Bhairava.  This is Siiktopiiya.

Having freed the mind of all supports,t" one should refrain  from all thought-constructs.2 Then, 0 gazelle-eyed one. there  will be the state of Bhairava in the Self that has become the  absolute Self.98 VijRanabhairava  NOTES  

1. 'All supports' includes both external support such as  perception of objects and internal support such as imagination,  fancies, concepts, pleasure, pain, etc.  

2. He should be completely rid of Vikalpas. Savikalpa  (activity of mind with thought-constructs) is the state of the  psychological individual or the empirical self; nirvikalpa (activity  of consciousness without dichotomising thought-constructs)  is the state of the spiritual Self, the witnessing Consciousness of  aU the states.  

This is $iimbhavopaya.

NOTES  

This is the dharalJa of the first phase of pratyabhijRa or re cognition. Man is $iva already in essence. The essential Rea~  lily in him has put on the mask ofjlva. When thejiva IDtensely  recognizes his essentIal Reality, the mask is thrown off. The  stage of vilaya or veiling disappears; anugraha (grace) is  operative now, and thejlvabecomes $iva (that he was in reality).  This is $akta upaya.

This is the dhiirlJ(lii of the second phase of pratyabhijRii. The  first phase of pratyabhijflii (recognition) consists in recognizing  the jiva (the empirical self) as Siva. the identity of the individual  Self with the Universal Self. The dhiirQ1Jii of this phase has been  given in the previous verse (109). The second phase consists in  recognizing the fact that this glory of manifestation is mine.  This consists in recognizing the identity of the universe with the  Self. The present verse gives the dhiirQ1Jii for this recognition.

If on account of lack of power to apprehend objects of  knowledge or on account of (sheer) ignorance, there is dissolu tion of mind leading to absorption in (anasrita sakti), then at  the end of the cessation of commotion brought about by that  absorption, there appears the form of Bhairava (i.e. His  essential nature) 112.  

NOTES ON III & 112  

Both of these verses refer to the condition of mind at the end  of some intense commotion. Verse 111 refers to a state of mind  brought about by commotion set up by physical condition.  Verse 112 refers to a state of mind brought about by commotion  set up by intellectual impasse.  

When there is a deep stirring of the mind either by some  physical condition, or by some obstinate questioning or doubt,  then after the momentary commotion has ceased, the normal  mind is completely stilled; vikalpas (thought-constructs) are laid  to rest, and there is an invasion of truth from a higher plane of  consciousness. At such a moment is revealed the essential  nature of Bhairava.  

The Dharana in 111 is Sambhavopaya. that in 112 is  ·Saktopaya. .

TRANSLATION  

o goddess, listen, I am going to tell you this mystic tradition  in its entirety. If the eyes are fixed without blinking (on the  reality within), isolation (kaiva/ya) will occur immediately. 113.  

Contractinp the openings of the ears and similarly the open ings of the anus and penis(and then), meditating on (the interior,  impactIess sound-anahala dhvani) without vowel and without  consonant, one enters the eternal Brahman. 114  

NOTES  

Slabdhamatrayo~ netrayo~ refers to Bhairavi or Bhairava mudra  in which the eyes are open outside without blinking, but the  attention is turned on the Reality within. In such a state one is  freed of all vikalpas (thought-constructs) and is identified with  Siva.  

Klilemanija has quoted this verse in his Udyota commentary  on Svacchanda Tantra (vol. I1.p. 283), and intet-prets it in the  following way:  

"f.:m~«I"&~~&: VTT"OT rCl4lf~d If~eTTur~ClCfi{'q"lI\'1:I" .. "Rejecting the sight of the external world by Bhqiravi mudra,  the aspirant enjoys peace inasmuch as his desires are abolished  and ~he entire net-work of vikalpas is destroyed."  

It should be borne in mind that the kaivalya (isolation) reco mmeJlded by the non-dualistic Sa iva philosophy is different 

102 VijRiinabhairava  

from the one advocated by Silikhya yoga. In accordance with its  dualistic standpoint, Silikhya-Yoga believes "that there is nothing  common between pwu/a and pralcrti, and, therefore, kaivalya,  according to it, means complete isolation from Prakrti, and,  hence. from the universe. In Saiva philosophy. it means the  disappearance of the externality of the world and its contraction  in $iva with whom the experient is identified in Kaivalya.  

The imperceptible. inaudible, unstruck sound without a vowel  or consonant would be 'it i.e. the bindu (dot) only minus  the vowel 'a'. The bindu by itself represents $iva. The inaudible  sound without consonant or vowel would be pure visarga Sf; i.e.  the visarga without 'a'. This pure visarga represents lalcti. Since  the interior sOllnd being aniihata cannot be h~ard and being  without vowel or consonant cannot be uttered, it can only be  meditated upon. Since bindu, without vowel or consonant re 

presents Siva, this particular meditation is meant to assist the  jlva (the empirical soul) to return to Siva.  

By the above practice. the yogi enters brahma saniitanam i.e.  the $abdabrahman who, as the origin of all sound and there fore of all manifestation, is eternal and above all difference  and manifestation. By practising the above dhiirtllJii, the yogi  acquires wonderful vitality which enables him to enter Brahman  who represents the union of $iva and $alcti and thus of iinanda  (supreme bliss) and sviitantrya (supreme autonomy). This is  wha~ Abhinavagupta says in paratriJpsiki:  

parabrahmamaya-siva-salcti-stU/lghalliinandasviitantryasmiparii bhalliirikiirupe'nupraveSa/i (p. SO)  

The dhiirtllJii in 113-114 is of Siiktopiiya.

If one stands above a very deep well, etc., and fixes his eyes  (on the space inside the well without blinking) his understand ing becomes freed of vikalpas (thought-constructs) completely. and  immediately he definitely experiences dissolution of mind.  

NOTES  

If the yogI fixes his gaze (without the blinking of the eyes) for  a long time on the space inside a deep well or on the summit of  a mountain, he feels giddiness and has a sense of fear. In this  state, spanda or the inner dynamic Reality throws him off his  normal consciousness and if he has already developed mati or  intuitive understanding by pure living, it is freed of vikalpasand  in an instant, his normal consciousness is dissolved in a conscious 

ness of higher dimension, and he experiences surpassing peace.  This is Sambhava upiiya.

TRANSLATION  

Wherever the mind goes whether towards the exterior or  towards the interior, everywhere there is the state of Siva.  Since Siva is omnipresent, where can the mind go (to avoid  Him).  

NOTES  

This verse has two aspects, one metaphy'sical, the other  mystic. The metaphysical aspect maintains that everytbingin the  universe-subjective or objective is Siva. The mystic aspect says 

104 Vijiiiinabhairava  

that since everything is Siva, the aspirant need not be perturbed  if he is unable to concentrate on some mysterious U~iversal  Reality. Whatever attracts the mind, whether it is something  external like a jar or some colour like blue, yellow, etc. or whe 

ther it is something internal-an emotion, a thought, let that be  taken as Siva with full conviction and be made an object of  meditation. The result will be surprizing. The particular object  or emotion or thought being meditated upon as ~iva can no  longer stand out as something different from Siva, something  isolated from the Universal stream of consciousness but is bound  to appear as that Universal Consciousness itself in that particular  aspect. It will thus drive away from the mind of the aspirant all  selfish and sensuous desire, it will free his mind of useless  vikalpas (thought-constructs) and will ensure his entry into the  divine consciousness.  

This is Siiktopiiya.  

The same teaching has been emphasized in Spandakarika  (II, 3, 4, 5).

On every occasion that the consciousness of the Omnipresent  Reality (caitanyaflZ vibhoM is revealed through the sensory organs  since it is the characteristic only of the Universal Consciousness,  one ShOllld contemplate over the consciousness appearing through  the sensory organs as the pure Universal Consciousness. Thus  his mind will be dissolved in the Universal Consciousness. He  will then attain the essence of plenitude (which is the characteri- 

. stic of Bhairava). 

Vijfiiinabhairava lOS  NOTES  

Normally, every sensation appearing through a sense organ is  considered to be a characteristic function of that sense-organ.  This dhiirOlJii says that every sensation whether external or internal  should be considered not merely as a psycho-physical fact  but as an expression of the Universal Consciousness. The aspirant  should contemplate over every sensation in this light. Just as  every reflection or image appearing in a mirror is nothing diffe 

rent from the mirror, even so the whole world that appears in  the Light of the U,niversal Consciousness is nothing different  from it. Apart from that Universal Consciousness, it has no  being whatsoever. When the yogi contemplates over every  manifestation in the above light, his mind is dissolved in that  Universal Consciousness which is the essential substance of this  universe, and thus he attains the nature of Bhairava.  

This is Siiktopiiya.

At the commencement and end of sneeze, in terror, in sorrow,  in the condition of a deep sigh or on the occasion of flight from  the battlefield, during (keen) curiosity, at the commencement  or' end of hunger, the state is like that of brahma.  

NOTE  

The word gahvara means both a cavern or 'deep sigh. As  most of the conditions mentioned are psychophysical or emotio nal the word gahvara has been taken in the sense of deep sigh, 

106 VijRanajJhairava  

Whether it is an insignificant condition like sneeze or hunger  or highly significant condition like terror, keen curiosity Qr flight  from the battlefield, whenever the ordinary normal consciousness  receives a sudden jolt or shock, it is thrown back to its inmost  depth and comes in contact with spamia, the pulsation of the  deepest consciousness, the source of his being. It is a sudden  and momentary state, but if the person is wide awake, he clings  to it. From that moment, his life is completely changed. He  becomes spiritually oriented; his energies are released from the  

hold of the trivialities oflife and are free to dive into the deeper  recesses of consciousness. If one seizes this momentous oppor tunity, one enters the sanctuary of the higher life. If one simply  lets it go by, one has lost the opportunity of his life, for this  condition does not usually return.  

Spandakarikii has mentioned a similar condition in the follow ing verse:

"When one is in extreme anger or experiences surpassing joY'.  or is in a state of impasse, not knowing what to do, or has to  flee for his life, then in that (supremely intensive) state (of mind) is  established the Spanda principle, the- creative pulsation of the  divine consciousness ..

At the sight of a land, when one lets go all the thought of the  remembered objects (and concentrates only on the experience

which was the basis of that memory) and makes his body  supportless, then the Lord (who as the experience was the basis  of the memory) appears.  

NOTES  

On remembering a particular object, the aspirant should  ignore the memory of the object and fix his mind on the original  experience which is the basis of the memory. At the same time,  he should detach himself mentally from the body, i.e. the psycho 

somatic organism in which the memory and the residual impres sions are stored. In this state, his mind will be freed of I-con sciousness and the deposit of the residual impressions (vasami) and  will be restored to its pristine form of pure Experienc~, pure  Consciousness. This pure Consciousness or Experience is the  nature of Bhairava.

TRANSLATION  

o goddess, if one, after casting one's gaze on some object,  withdraws it and slowly eliminates the knowledge of that object  along with the thought and impression of it, he abides in the  void.  

NOTES  

The aspirant can eliminate the knowledge of the object along  with its impression either (1) by sunyabhiivanii or (2) by bhairavi  mudrii.  

1. Sunyabhiivanii is the imaginative contemplation that the  whole world is unsubstantial, mere void. When the whole world108 - Vijiiiinabhairava  

is believed to be void, naturally a particular object in the world  will also become void.  

2. Bhairavimudrii is a pose in which the eyes are open exter nally without blinking, but the attention is turned to the inner  essential Self. Though the eyes are open, the aspirant sees  nothing of the external world.  

This dhiiraIJii teaches that the aspirant should fix his attention  only on his essential Self and withdraw it from everything else  so that the external world loses its hold on him.  

This is Siiktopiiya.

The sort of intuition (mati) that emerges through the intensity  of devotion in one who is perfectly detached is known as the  Jakti of sankara. One should contemplate on it perpetually.  Then he becomes Sil'a Himself.  

NOTES  

One who is perfectly detached i.e. is not attached to sensuous  pleasures and is devoted to God develops mati. The word  mati is used in a technical sense here. It means pure spiritual  intuition that is dynamic. This mati is full of beneficent power  (fiinkarl sakti) that can transform and consecrate life. That is  why this dhiiraIJii recommends contemplation on mati.  

There are four steps in this dhiiraIJii. (1) one's value of life has  to be totally changed. He should be completely detached from  .sensuous pleasures and trinKets of life. (2) He should be devoted  to God. (3) Through the above two, the mind of the aspirant 

Vijiiiinabhairava 109  

will become purified, and then will emerge mati which is spm tual intuition full of the power to transform life. She can remove  an obstacles in the path of the aspirant. (4) The aspirant should  perpetually contemplate on this matj (nit yam bhiivayet tiim).  She will completely transform his life, and then his mind will be  dissolved in Siva (tatal}. Sival,t).  

It should be borne in mind that bhakti or devotion does not  mean simply offering of flowers and burning incense. It means  viewing God in all life and dedication of oneself to the Divine in  word, thought and deed.  

This is Siimbhava upiiya.

When one perceives a particular object. vacuity is established  regarding all other objects. If one contemplates on this vacuity  with mind freed of all thought, then even though the particular  object be still known or perceived, the aspirant has full tranqui

NOTES  

When the aspirant contemplates on vacuity with mind freed  of all thought, there is only the light of consciousness (cit prakiisa) present and nothing else. There is no object to attract  his attention. The result is that his differentiation-making mind  is now at stand-still. The sense of difference dis~ppears from his  mind. So even when the particular object which he, had perceiv ed is still present in the field of his consciousness, his differen tiation-making mind is dissolved and he experiences wonderful  peace.

TRANSLATION  

That purity which is prescribed by people of little understand ing is considered to be only impurity in the Saiva system. It  should not be considered to be purity; rather it is impurity in  reality. Therefore one who has freed himself of vikalpas (dichot omizing thought-constructs) alone attains happiness.  

NOTES  

The purity criticized in this verse r.efers only to physical purity  like washing, bathing, etc. The Saiva system referred to is the  Trika system. This system does not lay any special store by  external physical purity. It considers only-mental purity to be  real purity. Physical purity depends only on vikalpas-differen-.  

tiating thought-constructs and is centred round the body. There fore, the Trika system considers it only an impurity from the  higher spiritual point of view. It does not condemn physical  purity as such. It condemns it only when it is considered to be 

VijiiOnabhairava 111  

a passport to the spiritual life, when it is boosted at the cost of  moral and spiritual purity.  

In reality, that c~nnot be considered to be purity at all which  is based on vikalpas and the body. In the real sense, he alone is  pure who has freed himself of vikalpas (nirvikalpa~), and he  alone can enjoy real happiness.  

According to Svami Lak~maI)a Joo, the reading of this verse  should be "Kiiicijjiiair ya. smrta. suddhil]. sa. suddhil]. sambhu dariane. Na suchir nasucis tasman nirvikalpal]. sukhi bhavet."  

"That which is considered to be purity by men of little under standing is in Trika philosophy neither purity nor impurity. One  who rises above vikalpas (alone) is really happy." The real  purity is not of the body. It consists in rising above vz"fCalpas and  getting absorbed in the supreme I-consciousness.

NOTES  

This dhiira1)ii does not require any particular practice of  meditation. Bhairava is an ever-present Reality to one who has  an intense deep-rooted conviction of two things~viz. (1) every  one uses the first personal pronoun 'I'. Even ignormuses are  conscious of this 'I'.

"He whom even ignormuses know, whom even portresses  of water know well enough, to whom alone every one makes a  bow, who is Master of sakti (power)-where is the person to  whom He is not evident."  

How does every person know Him ? He knows Him in the  I-consciousness which is common to all. The pseudo-I which  every body has to use willy-nilly is only a symbol of the non dual Eternal'!' throbbing in the heart of every creature. This  Eternal'!, is vijniina Or cidiinanda-consciousness-bIiss. This is  Bhairava. Thus He is known internally to every body.  

2. He is known externally also through His Sakti-power or  Energy, His manifestation in the cosmos.  

He who thus knows Bhairava both internally and externally  is fully convinced of the fact that there is nothing else than  Bhairava. He is a God-intoxicated person. To him, Bhairava  is an ever-present Reality. He is identified with Bhairava and  thus enjoys the non-dual state perpetually.

the conviction of the presence of Brahman everywhere), he is  perpetually happy.  

NOTES  

Because of the conviction of the presence of Brahman (the  Divine Reality) everywhere, the aspirant develops the conscious ness of samata (equality), and, therefore, has the same attitude  of goodness towards all, is neither elated when he receives  honour, nor is depressed when he is subjected to dishonour.  The same idea occurs in Gita-V, 18 and XIV, 25. All mental  agitation disappears in his case. Being even-minded, he enjoys  perpetual happiness.

TRANSLATION  

The aspirant should neither maintain the attitude of aversion  nor of attachment towards anyone. Since he is freed of both  aversion and attachment, there develops brahmabhava or the  nature of the divine consciousness (which is also the nature of  

the essential Self) in his heart.  

NOTES  

The consciousness of samata (equality) is the main point in  both these verses (125 and 126). The only difference between  the two is that in dhara1J,a No. 125, the aspirant has to acquire  samata by contemplating on the positive prese~ce of Brahman  everywhere, whereas in dhiira1J,a No. 126, he has to acquire  samata by rejecting the attitude of both aversion and attach 

ment.

Both these dharaoas are Siiktopiiya.  [Dbiraoa 102]

TRANSLATION  

"That which cannot be known as an abject,l that which  cannot be grasped (i.e. that which is elusive), that which is •  void,1I that which penetrates even non-existence3 all that should  be contemplated as Bhairava. At the end of that cOf,ltemplation  will occur Enlightenment.  

NOTES  

1. The Ultimate Reality has been called avedya or unknow able in the sense that it is vedaka i. e. the Eternal and Ultimate  Subject of everything and cannot be reduced to vedya or  object.  

2. Void or Simya, Sivopadhyaya in his viv!ti (commentary)  quotes the following verse to show in what sense the word  sunya is taken in Trika philosophy :  

"tI .. V~k1'1Q1iQ;;r tlciat<t <111'«1': I  

ttCicftllllillj4: QTflf '1' Wilt q{ijjeia: II" .. .. 

"That which is free of all iilambanas, of aU tattvas, of the  residual traces of all klesas, that is siinya or void. It is not void  as such in its highest sense.  

The word iilambana means 'support'. It is either an  objective existent like a jar or blue colour etc. or an internal  existent like pleasure or pain or a thought etc. Bhairava or the  Highest Reality is called sunya in the sense that He cannot be  characterized or limited by any of these objective or subjective . characteristics. . 

Vijiianabhairava 115  

He is free of aU tattvas or constitutive principles. AIl consti tutive principles derive their existence from Him. Therefore,  He cannot be characterized by these.  

He is free of all klelas and their residual traces. The kle§as  are avidya or primal ignorance, asmita or ego-sense, raga or  attachment. dve~a or aversion, and abhinive§a clinging to parti cular forms of life, fear of death.  

The Highest Reality is called siinya or void, because it is  free of aU these, not because it is not Real.  

3. Both existents and non-existents owe their stance to that  Highest Reality. It is the common ground of both existence  and non-existence. Sivopadhyaya quotes in this connection  the folIowing significant verse from Maharthamaiijari :  

"~: ~~J!l,,: ~'1Cff~ .'.''1tt1¥t+4 , 

~a:7'IlIn'::r'UTlln~ ~ •• " lI~<OIl'pIlOn \'11"11: ~ .... ~~ II (Verse 32)  

"What is the difference between an existent flower and a sky flower (which is non-existent). The universe derives its life from  the (divine) creative flash (sphura!la or sphuratta) and that flash  is the same everywhere. It is the common ground ,of both the  existent and the non-existent."  

The power of the Supreme viz. svatantrya sakli known as  sphuratta or mahasatta is present everywhere and is the  common ground of everything existent or non-existent. In the  words of Utpaladeva :  

m ~ ~ ~rmfl!f1lft I  

~ ~ sr)UiT ~ q <ilNi'1': II  

(I. P. I Verse 14)  

"This power of Universal Consciousness is the inner, creative  flash which, though in itself unchanging, is the source of all  change, it is mahiisatta or absolute being inasmuch as it is free  to be anything, it is the source of alI bhava or abhava (existent  or non-existent). It is beyond the determinations .of space and  time. It being the essence of all is said to be the very heart of  the Supreme Sovereign."  

Abhinavagupta's commentary on this is very enlightening.  He says, 

116 Vijnanabhairava  

~:q ~.ffi' ijcir"iitjl~ ~J{ 1 m :q ~tqlf~­ Cfilffq oqftiftftr ~ ~T I  

The word satta or being is, in this context, used in a techni cal sense. It does not mean simply being. "It indicates the  essential nature of the agent in the act of being i.e. freedom in  all actions. It is called mahasatta, because it pervades even the  sky-flower (which is non-existent)."  

This dhiirQ1;zii, therefore, exhorts the aspirant that he should  contemplate on Bhairava as totally free of all distinctive thought constructs, as foundational Consciousness whose essential nature  is mahiisattii, the absolute freedom to appear in any way. He  will then have full eqlightenment.  

This dhiir01;zii is· Siinibhavopiiya.

One should fix his mind on the external space which is  eternal, without support, void, omnipresent, devoid of limitation.  (By this practice) he will be absorbed in non-space.  

NOTES  

Two important points have been made out in this dhiira1J.ii.  Firstly, since it is not easy to concentrate on abstract void, the  aspirant has been advised to concentrate on the' vast, illimitable  external space. Khal'fl or iikiifa. the endless external expanse  of vacuity has generally been held to be the symbol of void,  Brahman, purity, immensity. Therefore. by prolonged practice  of concentration on the boundless external space, one acquires  the capacity of concentrating on supportless, objectless, vacant 

Vijniinabhairava 117  

reality. After this, one can, with facility, concentrate on the  inner, supportless, objectless Reality, the spiritual consciousness,  the met-empirical Self or iitman and thus can have the samiiveSa  or absorption into the nature of Bhairava which transcends all  spatial, temporal and empirical modalities.  

Secondly, in the previous verse Bhairava has been designated  as siinya or siinya-dhiima, the very abode of void. In the  present verse, He has been designated as 'niriikiisa' transcend ing all void (atiSiinya) or asiinya (non-void), the base and  foundation of the void itself and therefore mahiisiimiinya,  mahiisattii.  

This dhiirafjii is Siiktopiiya.

Towards whatever object the mind goes, one should remove  it from there immediately by that very mind, and thus by not  allowing it to settle down there i.e. by making is supportless,  one will be free from agitation (of the mind).  

NOTES  

The agitation of the mind can be removed by vazragya and  abhyiisa. i.e. by disinterestedness and practice i.e. by withdrawing  one's interest from other things and by repeated concentration  on the object of meditation. Both the negative and the positive  method should be practised together. The negative method  consists in withdrawing the attention from the object that dis 

tracts it and the positive method consists in concentrating on the  particular object of meditation.118 VijRanabhairava

Bhairava is one who with His luminous consciousness makes  every thing resound or who being of luminous consciousness joined  with kriyiiSakti comprehends the whole universe, who gives  everything, who pervades the entire cosmos. Therefore by  reciting the word Bhairava incessantly one becomes Siva.  

NOTES  

The hermeneutic etymology of the word Bhairava has been  given in various ways in Trika philosophy. The important  interpretations are given below.  

The word 'Bhairava' is composed of four letters-'bM' + 'ai'  + Ira' + 'Va' (111' + ~ + ~ + ~). 'BM' + 'ai' (111' + ~) by the  rule of sandhi (i.e. euphonic junction of final and initial letters)  becomes bhai (1l). This bhai together with 'ra'. 'va' becomes  bhairava (~). Each of these letters connotes certain important  ideas.  

Bhii (1R) is a word by itself which means' light' i.e. the light  . of consciousness in this context; ai (~). according to Trika  philosophy is symbolic of kriyiiiakti (the power of activity); 

Vijiidnabhairava 119  

rQva connotes ravayati which, in this context, means vimarśati  i.e. comprehends. So according to this etymoloty Bhairava  means "He whose light of consciousness-joined with his ·power  

of activity ('bhii' + ai i.e. bhai) comprehends (ravayati) the  entire universe is His Self".  

In Paritrirpsiki, Abhinvavagupta gives another interpretation  of Bhairava viz.,' 'Bhairavo bhara1"litmako mahimantraravitma kasca" (p.63). i.e. 'Bhairava is one who supports and protects  the cosmos and (constantly) sounds the great mantra of 'I'  (aham)."  

In Tantraloka, Abhinavagupta gives many interpretations of  'Bhairava' of which the main ones are the following three:  1. He supports the cosmos inasmuch as He makes it appear  on Himself as substratum and maintains it and also appears in  the form of the cosmos (bhriyate savimarśataya). This interpreta tion is based on the root bh, which means both dhiirQl)a and  pOia1)a i.e. support and maintenance.  

2. He constantly sounds the great mantra of 'I' (ravarii patasca).  

3. He offers intrepedity to those who Itte terrified by the  cycle of transmigratory existence (sal1Jsarabhrruhitakrt).  Each letter of Bhairava is symbolic of His three main activi ties; Bha is symbolic of bhara1)a or maintenance of the  universe; ra is symbolic of raVQl)a or withdrawal of the  universe; va is symbolic of vamana or projection of the  universe.  

The two adjectives of 'Bhairava' viz., sarvadalJ. (bestower of  all) and vyapakalJ., (all-pervasive) are also connected by impli cation with two letters of Bhairava, viz., ra and va; ra is  symbolic of the root ra which means to give, to grant. to  bestow. He is called sarvadalJ., because he bestows everything  (sarval1J rati) 'va' is symbolic of va which means 'to be diffused'  Bhairava is called vyapaka because of the diffusion of His  presence everywhere. .  

It should be borne in mind that the word uccara in the verse  does not mean mechanical repetition of the word Bhairava.  Uccara in this context denotes the sounding of the interior  prafUlsakti which is the representation of sal1Jvid or consciousness. 

120 VijRanabhairava  

This pra~asakti rises from the heart (centre) and through  supnnna reaches dvadasanta or Brahmarandhra where it is united  with prakasa or Bhairava.

TRANSLATION  

On the occasion of the assertion, "I am; this is mine, etc.," the  thought goes to that which does not depend on any support.  Under the impulsion of the contemplation of that (tat), one  attains (abiding) peace.  

NOTES  

Niradhara or supportless is pur~aham, the absolute 'I' which  is nirvikalpa (above all thought-constructs). Even when a man  considers the pseudo-I to be the Self, there is present behind  the pseudeo-I, the absolute 'I', the nirvikalpaka or the thought 

free Self which is ever-present consciousness-bliss both in the  ignorant and the wise. So when a man asserts the pseudo-I to  be the Self, his mind sub-consciously relIects the real, the  absolute, the thought-free I which is eternally vibrating in him  behind his psycho-physical I. The present dhara~a exhorts the  aspirant to lay hold of that absolute, thought-free I, and then  by the creative contemplation (bhavana) of that thought-free I,  (taddhyanaprera1)at) his savikalpaka mind will ultimately be  absorbed in nirvikalpaka state, and thus he will attain abiding  peace.  

. The word dhyiina (meditation) in this context is equivalant to  bhavana (contemplation). This dhiira1)a is, therefore, Saktopaya. 

VijRiinabhairava 121  

By Saktopaya, a suddha vikalpa ultimately ends in nirvikalpa  which is the essential nature of Bhairava. The tat (that) in  taddhyiina refers to niriidhiira. This dhiira1;lii advises the aspirant  to lay hold of the niriidhiira and contemplate over that (tat) as  his real Self. Surely this contemplation will also be a  vikalpa (dichotomizing thought), but it will be suddha vikalpa  (pure vikalpa) which by Siikta bhiivanii will ultimately end in  n i rvikalpa.  

In Tantraloka I (Verses 214-215) Abhinavagupta points  out how by Siikta upiiya, savikalpa is finally transformed in  nirvikalpa.

"Eternal. omnipresent, without depending on any support. all pervasive. lord of all that is "-meditating every instant on  these words in conformity with their sense, one attains his  object (i.e. has fulfilment)  

NOTES  

By constantly pondering over the implication of these words.  the mind of the aspirant becomes chockful of the essential  reality of Siva. By comprehending perfectly the sense of nitya  and vibhu, the aspirant comes to realize that the essential nature  of Bhairava and so also of his essential Self transcends 'time',  and by meditating on the significance of vyapaka, he realizes  that it transcends 'space' also. By meditating on niradhara,  he realizes that the nature of Bhairava and so also of his  essential Self is nirvikalpa i.e. 'transcendent to thought'.  

So by meditating on these characteristics of Siva, he has Self~  realization. Thus he becomes krtartha, his aim in life is fulfilled,  for knowledge of Self is the highest aim one can entertain.  This dhara!la pertains to Saktopaya.

This whole universe is without any essential reality like a  magical spectacle. What is the reality of a magical spectacle ?  If one is fully convinced of the non-essentiality of the universe  in this way, he attains to peace.  

TRANSLATION OF VERSE 134  

In the unchangeable Self, how can there be knowledge or  activity ? All external objects are dependent on knowledge;  therefore this world is void.  

NOTES ON VERSES 133-134  

Both the above verses refer to the unreality of the world.  The first one says that the world is like a magic show; there fore, it has no reality. The second one teaches the unreality of  the world on the basis of non-knowledge and non-activity.  The Self is one mass of consciousness without any division or  differentiation. There can be no change in it. Both knowledge  and activity are a kind of change. Therefore, knowledge  and activity cannot be possible in Self. All external objects of  the world are dependent on knowledge (and activity). As knowl edge and activity are unreal, so the world that is dependent  on these is also unreal, mere void. By contemplating in the above  ways, one acquires peace.  

It has to be borne in mind that the knowledge and activity  mentioned in this verse refer to the knowledge and activity of  the limited, empirical individual whose knowledge and activity  are permeated by a sense of difference, and pertain to the world  full of changes.  

In the essential Self there is absolutely no change or difference.  Therefore, the knowledge and activity of the empirical individual  belong only to the psycho-physical self, not to the essential  Self. The knowledge and activity ( jiiana and kriya) which are  the characteristics of the essential Self are saktis (jiianaSakli  and kriya-sakli) by which alone there can be any knowledge 

124 Vijiiiinabhairava  

or activity. Secondly, they are not dependent on the allta(lkara1)a  (buddhi, manas and ahaTflkiira) andjiiiinendriyas and karmendriyas  (organs of sense and action) just as the knowledge and activity  of the empirical individual are. Thirdly, they are not prompted  by any sense of difference.  

Both the above dhiira1)iis are Siiktopiiya

There is neither bondage nor Hberation for me. These (bondage  and liberation) are only bogies for those who are terrified (on  account of the ignorance of their essential nature). This (the  universe) appears as a reflection in buddhi (the intel1ect) Hke the  image of the sun in water.  

NOTES  

The Self is pure consciousness (cinmiitram). It is not 1imited  by space and time. The question of bondage or liberation can  arise only in the case of an entity that is limited by space and  time.  

Just as the image of the sun appears inverted in water, even so  it is the limited buddhi (in which the Self is reflected) that poses  as the Self and considers itself bound or liberated. Both bondage  and liberation are the imaginative constructs of buddhi. Self which  is pure consciousness transcends these imaginative constructs.  

Abhinavagupta throws a flood of light on this question in  lsvarapratyabhijiiiivimarśinī (IV. I,2)

"The Highest Lord, resting within His own self, in the  luminous mirror of His Self manifests within Himself by the  power of His perfect freedom, the objective aspect of the world  which is limited in its nature. In the midst of this creation, there  are the objects, such as pra!la, budd hi, body, etc. They are objects  and are to be referred to as this. But they can appropriately  function as subjects in relation to objects which are separate  from them. Therefore, as they cannot completely castoff objecti vity, so they shine as illumined with assumed and imperfect self 

consciousness, as 'I am Devadatta," "I am Caitra", etc.  When the aspirant is fully convinced that the question of  bondage or liberation arises only for the psychophysical self, not  for the metaphysical Self, he rises above the vikalpas of the  psycho-physical self and is immersed in the nature of Bhairava.  According to Svami Lak~mal,1a Joo, jivasya (of the empirical  subject) in place of bhitasya is a better reading, because bondage  and liberation. are bogies for all empirical subjects.  This dhara!lii pertains to Siimbhavopaya.

126 VijRiinabhairava  TRANSLATION  

All contact with pleasure and pain is through the senses,  (knowing this), one should detach oneself from the senses, and  withdrawing within should abide in his essential Self.  

NOTES  

All pleasure, pain, etc, derived through the sen-ses are not the  characteristics of the cidiitmii, the essential met-empirical Self,  but only of the empirical, psycho-physical complex miscalled  Self. When one is centred in his essential Self, one automatically  gets freed from the peremptory demands of the senses.  

The previous dhiira1}ii teaches that it is necessary to rise above  the activity of the buddhi (the intellect) and be poised in one's  essential Self. The dhiira1}ii mentioned in the present verse teaches  that it is necessary to detach oneself from the activities of the  senses also which lead us on towards the pleasures of the exter 

nal world. This is to be effected principally through sakti-san koca which has been defined in the following words in  Pratyabhijiilihrdayam.  

/I~: ~: (f..S:llili<UI Sjij(0t41 ~ 'liio-::qij'Jjiijul  ~V~I"

"Sakti-sankoca consists in turning in towards the Self, by  the process of withdrawal, of that consciousness which is  spreading externally through the doors of the senses (towards  the objects)". Sakli sankoca is the technique of introversion or  interiorization. By this practice, one becomes svastha, i.e. poised  in oneself and the attractions of the world do not trouble him  any longer. He is freed from the opposites of pleasure and  pain and abides in his essential Self which is the nature of  Bhairava. In the words of Y oga-vlisi~tha

All things are revealed by jiiiina i.e. the knowledge or Self and  the Self is revealed by all things. By reason of their nature being  the same, one should contemplate on the knower and the known  as one and the same.  

NOTES  

"All things are manifested by knowledge (jnana)." In this,  knowledge or jiiiina stands for thejiiiilii or the knower. So the  verse means to say that all the things known (jiieya) are  revealed by the jiiiina or knower (the jiiiilii) and the knower  or iilma is revealed by the known.

"0 dear one, so long as there are no knowers (selves, subjects),  how can there be the known (object)? The known and the  knower are really the same principle. Therefore, there is nothing  which is inherently impure Qr insentient."  

When the aspirant seriously and earnestly contemplates over  this fact, he is implanted in the nature of Bhairava.  Sivopadhyaya quotes another verse to re-enforce the  significance of the present dhiirQ1,lii :  

"S1Cf1I1/Ii{loi if q''fit; sr<IimRI'

"All manifestation is not separate from the light of conscious ness. The light of consciousness is never separate from 1- consciousness. The I-consciousness is nothing else than Self  and Self is simply cit or pure consciousness."  

Thus contemplating over the fact that the Subject, object and  cit constitute the same reality, one attains to the nature of  Bhairava.  

This is Siiktopiiya.  

According to Svami Lak~m!loa Joo, there is another reading  of this verse prevalent in the Saiva tradition :  

"Jnanam prakiiSakalJlloke atma caiva prakiiSakal}.l  Anayor aprthagbhiivat jiiane jiiani vibhiivyate." II  "In the world, jiiiina or knowledge reveals things and the Self  is the source of all revelation. Since there is no difference bet ween the Self and Jiiiina (knowledge), the jiiiinl (knower or Self)  is revealed in the jiiiina (knowledge)."

TRANSLATION  

o dear one, when the ideating mind (manas), the ascertaining  intellect (buddhi), the vital energy (priif)asakti) and the limited  empirical I-this set of four dissolves, then the previously  described (tat) state of Bhairava appears.  

NOTES  

ParikSif)am or the dissolution of manas, buddhi, etc. means  that they are transformed and appear in the words of Sivo padhyaya citcamatkilram iipannam as delightful aspects of the  pure, universal consciousness. 

VijRanabhairava 129  

This verse sums up the entire cosmic process. There is first  gradual nimeia or evolution of the universal Dynamic Cons ciousness (citi) into inconscient matter. This is the arc of  descent (avaroha). Citi assumes four forms for appearing as  limited individual life, viz., (I) Celana, ascertaining intellect  (buddhi), (2) manas, ideating mind, (3) praIJasakli or vital energy  which keeps the body and the mental faculties in proper form,  (4) the ego or the empirical self (designated as alma in the  present verse). A 11 these which form the inner Hfe of the  individual are usually summed up under the word cilia, the  individual consciousness. K~emariija maintains very clearly in  siitra 5 of Pratyabhijiiiihrdayam that "Citi (universal conscious ness) itself descending from the state of celana (uncontracted  conscious stage) becomes cilia (individual consciousness) inas much as it becomes contracted (sailkocini) in conformity with  the object of consciousness."  

Gradual unmeia or evolution begins from the stage of the  animal. Here life is mostly bahirmukhl or extroverted. There  is only sHght development of mind. Life at the human stage is  on the arc of ascent (adhyaroha). Man alone is given the oppor 

tunity of mounting to the summit of the spiriluallife provided he  is prepared to surrender his ego.  

The Trika philosophy proclaims that cilia (individual cons ciousness) can be transformed into citi (universal consciousness).  Pratyabhijiiiihrdayam says that cittameva anlarmukhibhavena  cetanapadadhyarohiil citib (sutra, 13)-"citta itself by inward  movement becomes citi by rising to the status of cetana." The  status of celana is the nature of Bhairava which is our own  essential Self. It is for this consummation that the various  dharaIJas have been recommended in Vijiiiinabhairava. When the  aspirant has reached a stage where he fully realizes that budd hi,  manas, praIJa and the ego are only formations of Maya for  carrying on the individual life, that they are only the instru 

ments of Self and do not constitute his essential Self, then he is  poised in his essential Self which is the nature o(Bhairava, then  these instruments reflect the life of the Spirit and can no longer  hamper its expression.

o goddess, I have described hundred and twelve dharaIJas (yogic  practices) in which there can be no surgel in the mind. Knowing  them, one can be a perfect gnostic person-139. If one is establish ed even in one of these practices, he will become Bhairava in  himself. He can effect anything by word alone. He will have the  power to confer benediction or malediction2-140.  

NOTES  

1. Nistaraliga - without any surge in the mind i.e. in which  the mind becomes nirvikalpaka-freed of thought-constructs.  Jayaratha in his viveka commentary explains it as svotmamotra- ,'isrontyo santarup'o (Tantraloka III. S, p. 349). i.e. resting in  one's essential Self, full of peace.  

2. Since he becomes identified with Siva, the source of all  power, he can effect anything he desires.  

112 dhoralJos have been described in order that the aspirant  may choose any according to his capacity. Bhairava says that  even if one dhoralJo is properly understood and practised by the  aspirant, he will be established in his essential Self and will attain  perfect peace.

He is liberated even while living, and carrying on all the  activities (of life), he is not affected by them.  

The goddess said "Great lord, if such is the nature of the  Supreme Sakti,142 then in the admittedly established rules of  spiritual life, who would be invoked in recitation and what will  be the recitation? Who, 0 great lord, would be meditated on,  who would be worshipped, who is to be gratifi~d ? 143  

To whom is oblation to be offered? For whom is sacrifice  to be performed ?' And how is it to be accomplished?  Bhairava says in reply, 0, gazelle-eyed one, this practice  (referred to by you) is exterior and pertains only to gross forms.  144. 

132 VijRanabhairava  NOTES  

1. AQima and other supernormal powers are the folIo Ning:  (1) AQima-the power of becoming as small as an atom.  (2) Laghima-the power of assuming excessive lightness.  (3) Mahima-the power of increasing the size.  

(4) Prapti-the power of obtaining everything.  

(5) Prakamya-the power of fulfilling one's desire with out any resistance; irresistible will.  

(6) Vatitva-the power of bringing all the elements and  material objects into subjection.  

(1) Ititrtva-the power of producing and destroying the  elements and mate.rial· objects.  

(8) .Yatrakamavasayitva-the power of fulfilling all  resolves.  

2. Darling of the yoginls-one sense of this expression is  that he becomes the master of the Saktis (powers) like jiiana  (knowledge), kriyii (activity), iinanda (bliss). According to the  Kaula traditiQn, there is another sense of the yoginls. A male  practitioner of yoga was known as vira or siddha and a female  one was known as yoginl. From this point of view, the sense of  the above would be "He becomes the favourite of the yoginls."  

3. Melipakas - The word melapaka means uniting, conjunc tion. In this context, Anandabhalta interprets it as sakalasya  asya vedya-vedaka-iidi-raseb khillkrlasvabhavab i. e. 'one who has  risen above all the distinctions of the knower and the known  etc., and has thus acquired the nature of Bhairava.' According  to the Kaula tradition melapaka means the gathering or union  of the siddhas and the yoginls.  

4. The question of Bhairavi was "who is para devl or the  highest sakti (power) of the divine 1" The answer that Bhairava  'has given is that para devl is only the sakli or nature of Bhairava  that everything in the universe is only an expression of that  nature and that out of the 112 dharlU,lQs described, if anyone  masters even one dharlU,lii, he would attain that divine nature.  

Bhairavi now puts a further question "If every thing in the  universe is only an expression of the divine and if the aspirant  . by practising to perfection anyone of the dhiirlU,las becomes  divine, then what becomes of tho distinction between the devotee 

VijRanabhairava 133  

and the object of devotion which is an established tenet and  fully accepted by religion ?  

The answer to this question of th~ devl is found in the next  verse.

TRANSLATION  

That creative contemplation which is practised on the highest  Realityl over and over again is in this scripture japall (recitation  in reality). That which goes on sounding spontaneously (inside)  in the form of a mantra (mystic formula) is what the japa is  about.1  

NOTES  

1. Pare bhave (the highest Reality) referred to in this verse  is the absolute I-consciousness. The import of this I-conscious ness is beautifully expressed in the following verse by  Utpaladeva :  

SiCfiIIlIt4ltqrq>Sjlf"d<~lciI ~ ~: I  

~ .... h fcfl!lfTf.a': ~etlr.,(,1tl<l: I

(Ajatjapramatrsiddhi-2 2-23)  

"Resting of all objective experience within the Self is what is  meant by I-feeling. This resting (within the self) is called  autonomy of Will, primordial doership and universal sovereignty  because of the cancellation of all relational consciousness, and  of dependence on anything outside oneself."  

2. Japa is not the muttering of some sacred formula. Japa,  in its real sense, is the bhavana or contemplation on one's 

134 Vijiiiinabhairava  

essential Self. K~emaraja in his commentary on III, 27 of the  Siva-sutras puts the idea of japa beautifully in the fol!owing  WQrds : "fill~'1aqdlfq'l!/li'1cHdlqJ'1k'll ~ ~"I "Japa consists  in the repetition of constant contemplation on the deity that is  one's own essential Self." In that connexion, he quotes the  present verse of Vijiianabhairava.  

Abhinavagupta also gives expression to the same idea about  japa in Tantraloka (I, 90).  

"~ ;Jflf: snm \llql\llqq~:QOId: I"  

'" "Japa freed of all ideas of ens and non-ens is the constant  contemplation of Siva's nature."  

Jayara~a commenting-on this verse says :

"Constant mindfulness of the nature of Siva which is pariiviik  or Self is japa, the essence of which consists in the mindfulness  of the reality which shines in between both bhiiva (ens) and  abhiiva (non-ens)". Immediately after this, Jayaratha also quotes  the present verse of Vijiianabhairava.  

3. Japa (recitation) consists in the repetition of mantra.  What is the mantra here. The second half of the verse clarifies  what this mantra is. It is the svaya1llniida, i.e. it is the mantra  so' ham (I am Siva) which the inward prii{lasakti ceaselessly  goes on sounding by itself in every living creature. It is this  automatic mantra which has to be contemplated on, and it is  this that is real japa.

NOTES  

1. Buddhi is the immediate and determinative aspect of  consciousness.  

2. Without any image means without an idol or yantra  (diagram), etc.  

3. Nirasraya or without support means without the help of a  particular spot to meditate on such as hrdaya (centre) mUladhora  or nabhi (navel), etc.  

Abhinavagupta has defined dhyana (meditation) in a similar  strain in Tantraloka (I, 89). Jayaratha in his commentary on  dhyayate parama11J dhyeyam occurring in verse 89 says,  

parama11J dhyeya11J slvalak$alJam paramakaralJa11J dhyayate  svatmabhedena paramrsyate i.e. "the object of meditation is  Siva who is the supreme source of all manifestation and who  is to be meditated on as non-different from one's own essential  Self." This is what is meant by dhyana or meditation in this  system. Immediately after the above comment, Jayaratha quotes  the present verse of Vijiiiinabhairava.

TRANSLATION  

Worship does not mean offering of flowers, etc.1 It rather  consists in setting one's heart on that highest ether of conscious ness which .is above all thought-constructs.! It really means  dissolution of self with perfect ardour (in the Supreme Cons ciousness known as Bhairal'a). 

136 VijRiinabhairava  NOTES  

1. Et cetera includes burning of incense, lighting a candle,  blowing of conch and other gross forms of worshipo  2. The highest ether of consciousness means vijRiina or the  supreme spiritual consciousness which is Bhairava.  In the same strain, Abhinavagupta gives an excellent descrip tion of worship in the following verse in Tantraloka :

(IV, p. 123)  

"Worship consists in the unification of the different streams of  sense experiences like form, colour, savour, etc. with the  infinite (ananta), free (svatantra), immaculate (vima/a) conscious ness of Bhairava which is above the limitation of space, time, etc.  (deJakii/iidyanavacchinna), entirely unconditioned (nirupiidhi),  perfect and highest consciousness (pur~a-parasa",vid)o"

When in the fire of Supreme Reality (i. e. Bhairava) in which  even the highest void is dissolved, the five elements, the senses,  the objects of the senses along with the mind (whose characteristic  is dichotomizing thought-constructs) are poured, with celana  as the ladle, then that is real oblation (homa).  

NOTES  

Three things are required in a sacrificial oblation (1) fire  (2) substances that are poured into the fire (3) a ladle in which  the substances to be poured are placed.  

In a real spiritual homa, (1) the Supreme Reality or Bhairava  is the fire. (2) It is into this fire that the body constituted by the  five elements, the senses, the objects of the senses together with  the manas i.e. all that constitutes the Empirical personality is to  be poured and sanctified.  

(3) Celana functions as the laddIe. That word celana is  untranslatable. It is intermediate between citi, the supreme  Universal consciousness and citra, the individual, empirical mind.  Celana is the intuitive consciousness which serves as anusandh 

iitrl-that which leads and unites the citra with citi.  There is another reading in place of cetanasruca, viz. cetana ca  sruk, adopted by Kl1emaraja which means cetana functions as  the laddie. There is no difference of meaning between the two  readings.138 Vijiianabhairava

TRANSLATION  

o supreme goddess, sacrifice in this system simply means  spiritual satisfaction characterized by bliss. 0 parvati. the  absorption into the sakti of Rudras is alone real kietra (place of pilgrimage) inasmuch as this absorption destroys all sins  (kiapa~at), and protects all (tral;lat). This constitutes the highest  contemplation. Otherwise in the case of the (non-dual)Reality,  how can there be any worship and who is it that is to be  gratified?  

NOTES  

All the rituals of the ordinary religious life are interpreted in  Vijiianabhairava in a higher spiritual sense. Japa (recitation of  mantras) has been interpreted as contemplation on the highest  Reality (in verse 145). Dhyiina(meditation) has been interpreted  as unswerving buddhi without the aid of any image or support  (in verse 146). Puja (worship) has been interpreted as firm  fixation of the mind on maluivyoma(highest Reality)(in verse 147).  Trpti has been interpreted as plenitude of spiritual consciousness  (in verse 148). Homa (oblation) has been interpreted as pouring.  of the senses together with their objects in the fire of Supreme  Reality (i. e. Bha;rava) (in verse 149).  

Now in verses ISO-lSI yoga or sacrifice has been interpreted  as the bliss of spiritual satisfaction. Kietra or place of pilgrimage  has been interpreted in a higher sense. The word Kietra is  composed of two letters kia and tra. kia symbolizes kiapa~a 

Vijniinabhairava 139  

or destruction of all sins by absorption in the sakli of the  Rudras, known as aniiSrita sakli, and tra symbolizes triiIJa or  protection inasmuch as one who merges himself in this sakI;  receives her protection.

TRANSLATION  

The essence of Self consists universally in autonomy, bliss, and  consciousness. One's absorption in that essence is said to be  (real) bath.  

NOTES  

Bath is considered to be an important purificatory step in  every ritual. Bhairava says that the usual physical bath does  not lead to real purification. It is the spiritual bath which con sists in a plunge in the essential Self characterized by autonomy,  bliss and consciousness that alone can lead to real purification.  

Abhinavagupta expresses this mystic bath beautifully in the  following lines in Tantraloka :  

'3~'illf~.na§d~a-~~ I  

fuo~~~\iA'~~ II (IV, 116-117)  

"The intuitive perception ofReaIity (jniina ) that flashes forth  by its light is like fire. Both the objective and subjective spheres  of experience are like fuel. When this fuel of the objective and  subjective spheres of experience is burnt completely by the fire  of jniina and the perception of the essential Se1f results in the  form of white ashes, then an immersion of the limited, empirical  self in that essential Self is alone said to be the real bath."

1. Offerings-like flower. incense, etc.

Pra1)a or the breath of exhalation goes out and the breath of  inhalation (jiva) enters in, in a curvilinear form. They do so of  their own accord (icchayQ). The great goddess (pra1)Qsakti or  

. kU1,l(ialinl) stretches up (dlrghatma). Being both transcendent  and immanent, she is the most excellent place of pilgrimage. 

VijHanabhairava 141  NOTES  

As Kalla~a puts it prak sQ1fIvit pralJe pariIJata. In all living  creatures, the divine consciousness is, at first, converted into  priirJ.a. This is known as pralJaSakti. Its two main forms in all  living beings are known as pralJa and apiina. PralJa is the breath  of exhalation and apana that of inhalation.  

In Saivagama, the letter ~ (ha) is the symbol of praIJaJakti. In  Sarada script of Kashmir, the letter 'ha' is written in a curvili near fashion. Both priiIJa and apiina move in all living beings in  a curvilinear way. That is why priiIJa and apiina have been  designated as ku!iliikrti/J. (of curvilinear form) in the verse. The  letter ha which is written in a curvilinear fashion, therefore, very  correctly represents priiIJaJakti.  

The apana breath (inhalation) has been very significantly  denominated as jlva (life). Apiina or inhalation is the breath that  returns inside after the priiIJa or exhalation. If apiina or the  breath of inhalation does not return, the living being is bound to  die.  

The word icchayii in the verse has been used to signify the  fact that priiIJa and apiina move out and move in, in a curved  way of their own accord. This kind of movement is automatic,  natural.  

PriirJ.asakti lies in three and a half folds round the centre muliidhiira in a curved way like a sleeping snake. In this form,  it is known as kUIJ~alini. When it lies in a dormant way, the  kUIJ~alinl sakti is known as aparii, simply immanent in life, not  yet active.  

So long as kUIJ~alinl is aparii, there is always a sense of  difference.  

Apiina or the breath of inhalation that enters the centre inside  produces the sound ha automatically, and the breath of exha lation that goes out to dviidasiinta produces the sound 'sab'  automatically. At their junction in the centre an anusviira on  ha is also added automatically. Thus this mantra ha1'fJsa/J. (~~:)  goes on sounding in every round of priiIJa-apiina in every  living being. This is known as ajapiijapa (a recitation that goes  on automatically in every living being without effort on the part  of anyone). This mantra means 'I am he' i.e. 'I am Siva. When 

142 Vijfziinabhairava  

this automatic mantra is consciously and repeatedly contemplat~  ed on by the aspirant, it automatically becomes so'ham (that  am I). By constant contemplation of this mantra, Ku'.ujalini rises  and stretches upward i.e. is elongated. That is why she is  called dirghiitma (elongated). Traversing through the intermediate  centres, she enters Brahmarandhra, and then arises unity con 

sciousness in the aspirant. In this condition, she is known as  parii (the highest, the most excellent, the transcendent). Since  she is both transcendent and immanent, she is called paraparii.  Because she inheres in the Supreme consciousness and also  carries on the life of the world consisting of pramiita (subject),  

prameya (object) and pramalJa (the cognitive relation between  the two), therefore, she is rightly called pariipara. Because she is  the sakt; of Mahadeva (Siva, the great lord), therefore, is she  known as Mahiidevi (the great goddess).  

She is called parakietram, the most holy place of pilgrimage,  because she destroys all the sins of the seeker (kiapalJiit) and  because she protects all (triilJiit). It is this mystic holy place that  the seeker must resort to and not geographical places like  Kuruk~etra or Banarasa.

Pursuing it and  resting in it (i.e. in the joy of the mantra (anucaran tii/han), one  becomes identified with the great goddess and thus (through her)  one attains to bhairava. 

Vijnanabhairava 143

The breath is exhaled with the sound sa and then inhaled  with the sound ha. (Thus) the empirical individual always  recites this mantra hal11sal). 155  

Throughout the day and night, he (the empirical individual)  recites this mantra 21,600 times. Such ajapa (recitation) of the  goddess is mentioned which is quite easy to accomplish; it is  only difficult for the ignorant. 156  

NOTES  

The present verse 155 is not printed in the edition of Vijiiana bhairava published in the Kashmir series of Texts and  Studies. But this has been quoted by K~emaraja in his  commentary on III. 27 of the Siva-sutras. This is definitely  required, for without it, the sense is incomplete. Therefore, with  out disturbing the arrangement of the number of verses as given  in the available edition of Vijiianabhairava, the verse as quoted  by K~emaraja has been given above. 

144 Vijiianabhairava  

In verse No. 156, the reading of the last line as adopted in  the available edition of Vljii8.nabhairava is as follows: prib:ta syante sudurlabha(/.. In this edition, it is the reading of K~emaraja  that has been adopted.  

The mantra hQfllSa(/. is repeated by every individual  automatically in every round of expiration-inspiration as the  verse 155 clearly says. "The incoming breath produces the  sound ha and the outgoing breath produces the sound sa(/.  spontaneously. "It is recited automatically in a natural way  without anyone's conscious recitation. Hence it is called ajapa 

japa i.e. automatic recitation. It is also known as haTflSa  mantra. The ha of this mantra represents Jakti and sa(/.  represents Siva; am in hamsa(/. represents the living individual  (jiva). This is known as trika mantra also, as it includes in  itself the three realities of Siva, sakti and nara or jiva. The  aspirant has to concentrate on am, the junction point of ha  and sa(/..  

One round of inspiration-expiration takes 4 seconds. So there  is automatic japa of hamsa(/. 15 times in a minute. In one  hour, there is (15 X 60) 900 repetitions of thisjapa. In a full  day and night, there are (900 X 24) 21,600 repetitions of this  japa.  

K~emaraja quotes the verse No. 156 in Svacchandatantra  (VII. p. 20) and there also he adopts the reading given here. He  has quoted the verse No. 156 in connexion with the following  verse of Svacchandatantra :  

"~ ~if: macfi": q«l~CjrCld~ I  

~;;rtf~: ft:r~'!fmqj~5I'~: II" {Verse 56)  

"The advanced aspirant always reposes in pralJahamsa i.e. the  pralJasakti in su~umna and thus realizes the highest Reality.  Because this pralJa is associated with the universal I (aham)  which is the very quintessence of all the mantras, therefore, it  is known as pralJahamsa. The japa or recitation of hamsa  mantra is indicated for him i.e. he who is absorbed in this  mantra always sounds it automatically. It gives both  supernormal powers and liberation."  

If the reading pralJasyiinte sudurlabha(/. is adopted, the  meaning would be "on the occasion of the last breath i.e. on the 

Vijfiiinabhairava 145  

occasion of death, one's identification of himself with this  ajapajapa is difficult i.e. it is only the fortunate few who owing  to excess of meritorious acts are able to maintain their  identification with the ajapiijapa at the I~t moment."

TRANSLATION  

o goddess, I have explained to you this teaching which leads  to the highest immortal state. This should never be revealed to  any and everyone, particularly to those pupils who belong to  another tradition, who are mischievous, cruel, and wanting in  devotion to their spiritual teachers.l On the contrary, this  teaching should be imparted without the least hesitation to those  whose minds are free from oscillating opinions,2 to vlras,3 to  magnanimous ones and to those who are devoted to the line of  spiritual teachers.  

o gazelle-eyed one, renouncing all these, viz., one's village,  kingdom, city, and country, son, daughter, and family. one 

146 Vijiiiinabhairava  

should lay hold of this teaching. What is the good of the above  evanescent things? This is the lasting treasure.  

NOTES  

1. Unworthy pupils may misuse these teachings. So these  should not be imparted to them .•  

2. Nirvikalpamatlniim here does not mean 'whose minds  are freed of all dichotomizing thought-constructs'. This is the  highest stage. If they have already reached that stage, they do  not require any teaching. The word vikalpa also means alterna 

tion, indecision, alternating opinion. It is in this sense that the  word has been used here. So, here it means 'those who are free  from oscillating opinions'.  

3. The word vlra does not mean 'hero' here. It means  viseie~a frayati iitmiinam iti vfra(z i.e. 'one who is self-controlled.'  According to Sivopadhyaya, it means 'one who has cut asunder  all doubts.'

I constantly bow to the luminous
Samvarta who has Vakrā [or Kubjikā]
seated on his lap, the Lord of Kula
who is oriented towards creation
[or who is in the bhāsā state] and
whose body is comprised of Mālinī and Mātṛkā.

<details><summary>Preface by Sthaneshvara</summary>

This hymn to Bhairava, written in both classical metrical verses and daṇḍaka forms that are common to some of the earliest tantric texts, is an initiation into the discourse of the sixty-four Bhairavāgamas, known as the non-dual (advaya) tantric teachings. The non-duality depicted here differs from other types of non-duality, better known for rejection of the phenomenal world, the body, or emotions. In these verses, Bhairava embraces all actions, and His absolute surge of Bliss coincides with everyday emotions of lived experiences. Here, Bhairava reveals the truth, the Absolute, the very being of the Supreme Goddess. Scant attention has been paid to Bhairava in the Śākta Tantras’ various descriptions of practices, mantras, and visualizations of the Goddess, because these forms and secretive mantras are being revealed by Bhairava, who is the upāya (means) for revealing Prajña (wisdom), the Goddess.

With each chapter identified as phases in generating soma-elixir, the hymn evokes Vedic metaphors, and is consistent with the Tantric understanding of Soma, where it resides within the body and is manifested by Kuṇḍalinī awakening. In four different stages of this soma-pressing, the same supreme being or absolute entity is portrayed as revealing himself as a young boy, a young man, then a mature and aged person. This gradual progression of the visualizations of Bhairava likewise parallels different aspects of the paścimāmnāya Goddess Kubjikā, with the entire hymn suggesting Her maṇḍala, the Saṁvartamaṇḍala. For this reason, the hymn itself honors Saṁvarta Bhairava. 

In this hymn, Bhairava is praised from the perspective of all kaulika transmissions (āmnāyas), each of which originally relates to different pīṭhas (Kāmarūpa, Pūrṇagiri, Jalandhara, Oḍḍiyāna), with primacy and worship given to different forms of Bhairava and the Goddess. While each of the pīṭhas has its own history and course of sādhanā, the integration of different transmissions occurred before the earliest written Tantric texts, as even the earliest of the Āgamas describe different transmissions and their mantras revealed by different Siddhas. These hymns are therefore the synthesis of the Āgamas and is oriented towards a deeper Śākta understanding of reality. 

Although this text does not expressly reveal any mantras, like any classical tantric hymn, various mantras can be found encoded within.+++(Still correct??)+++ Likewise, just as the ancient Bhairavāgamas used metaphors to describe secret rites, the hymn encodes such references in metaphors such as offering flowers, being seated in the maṇḍala of Bhairavīs, or savoring rasa. Evoking Bhairava again and again as fire, with metaphors that suggest the centrality of sacrificial fire in ancient Vedic rituals, references suggest how these rites are transformed and internalized in the transmissions centered around Bhairava.

While all mantras are arrangements of phonemes, two different primary orders organize them: the sequence called Mātṛkā, in which we have the alphabets from ‘a’ to ‘ha’; and the other, called Mālinī, that begins with the phoneme ‘na’. Even though there are also other orders of organizing the phonemes, and while the Mālinī order also has variations following the specific orders given in the Kubjikā and Trika systems, what remains constant and consistent is the Mātṛkā order for the primacy of Bhairava and the Mālinī sequence for the primacy of the Goddess. Even then, the difference between the Mātṛkā and Mālinī are only in the process of extracting the mantras from the symbolic codes and installing the mantras in the body: they are, in the end, the same phonemes visualized differently. 

Suggesting the order of Mātṛkās, the eight Bhairavas (from Asitāṅga to Saṁhāra) described in the first section relate to the expression of the Absolute ‘I Am’ (Aham) in its manifest and expressed body-form as the world of materiality, and how the same Aham expresses itself from the nameless and formless (anākhya) state to the expressed (vaikharī), waking consciousness. 

This process rests on a succession in which the anākhya state of Bhairava is the first ripple of that same illuminating pure consciousness wherein Bhairava resides in non-dual form. This is further individuated in the state of deep sleep or the collective state of absolute bliss; further down into the dream state of individuality as the expression of citi (pure consciousness) in the various instances of cognitive modes; all the way down to the waking state of consciousness, giving externality and materiality as expression of sat (pure being) into the manifold. 

Conversely, when the same Bhairava turns towards the retrieval of the externalised process, he absorbs externality and turns his gaze back in the same successive process of waking, dreaming and deep sleep state of consciousness in individual forms, while also absorbing externality of being, consciousness, and bliss. Bhairava thus reassumes his primordial form of Bhairava consciousness. The eightfold Bhairava, in a sense the very matrices or groups of phonemes, is the totality of the expression of corporeality, the externalization of Bhairava; and its retrieval back to absolute bliss. 

Moving from this basic external Mātṛka structure, in the next two sessions the hymn brings to the fore other forms, some of which can be identified here. Within the pūrvāmnāya Trika system, Bhairava is expressed in the triadic structure of Sadbhāva, Ratiśekhara and Navātman. Following the uttarāmnāya Kālikā Krama system, Manthāna Bhairava is the very Goddess when externalized, who offers his own externalized being in the fire of Kālasaṁkarśiṇī in this play of pure consciousness. Being in the body of Bhairava, in this account, is experiencing the same bliss that the Goddess portrays, while ascribing subjectivity to Bhairava (the externalized) so he may rejoice in the embrace of the Goddess (pure consciousness), as the ability to enjoy every single mode of being in its expressed forms.

Connected to the dakṣiṇāmnāya Goddess Kāmeśvarī or Tripurāsundarī are Baṭuka, Ānandabhairava, and Ratiśekhara from within the Trika triad. As the original tradition of Kāmeśvarī evolved, particularly in the ūrdhvāmnāya developments, this Goddess also came to integrate the modes of Mārtāṇḍa Bhairava. As different transmissions of Bhairava were integrated within Śrīkrama, the original association of the southern transmission with Svacchanda became more and more esoteric. 

The primary metaphors that repeatedly appear in these hymns are of space (ākāśa), autonomy (svacchanda) or ‘having a blue or black body’ (asitāṅga); as well as surge, pulsation (spanda), and appearance (ābhāsa). Expressed by means of these different metaphors, the core teaching is that of the externalized reality as the very body of Bhairava, materiality being the very expression or body of Bhairava. Accordingly, externalized forms of experience in their emotional states are also the very surge of Bhairava. Bhairavas, therefore, are depicted displaying emotional states of delight, arousal, wrath, anger, fury, and disgust. What is being expressed, and the agent who is expressing, the body that is the site of feelings and emotions, and the Self that is evaluating the feelings manifest in the body, are all in the same field of being called Bhairava. Temporality, expression of being in time, expression of consciousness in time, evaluative judgmental consciousness of our emotional state, in both time and transcendence, are likewise fundamental to the same Bhairava invoked in various forms such as Mahākāla.

From beginning to end, the metaphor of fire is consistent, but in some cases, as in Kālāgni Rudra or Ucchuṣma, these metaphors are more vibrant. For, in the ferocious forms that Bhairava assumes therein, he is visualized as incinerating every single remnant of dualism, every single concept reinforcing duality, every single instance of being and consciousness that suspends the singular non-dual expression of Bhairava. These also stand for the rise of Kuṇḍālinī as the path/progression of prāṇa in its higher and higher states, which is depicted through the metaphors of flames and the experiences described in terms of burning and incinerating. These are the metaphors for the incineration of the karmic residue that keeps the individual seeker tied to externality and materiality, tied to the norms that constitute bondage rather than liberation. 

In the last section, the Bhairava image that is constantly depicted carrying a skull-cup goes back to the very early kāpalikās or skull-bearers, who are known for their external gestures or for living in the cremation grounds. What is less well known is how these gestures are internalized and are lived in latter tantric practices that depict emotional and cognitive modes of the very presence of the absolute, Bhairava.+++(4)+++ 

At the end, being Bhairava or experiencing oneself as Śiva rests on the dissolution of the factors that ensnare individuals with the ties or pāśa, the delimiting factors. In this liberated state, the Mātṛkas, the very matrices that cause bondage, become the very potency to grant liberation among other perfections (siddhis). Bhairava’s own expressed or opened eyes therefore become the metaphor for confirming that being in the world while also living in the presence of the absolute modes of expression of pure consciousness and joy equal the supreme bliss in the form of Bhairava. 

The Bhairavas described here synthesize both the Vāma, left-handed path or desirous-loving body-form; and the Dakṣiṇa, the right-handed or divine body-form, in which the rituals and visualizations are given in specific orders following norms of purity. Bhairava, thus, is both the norms and their transcendence; and the transcendence also of transcending the norms, that is where the Absolute freedom resides. Our fundamental quest in life is therefore freedom, and Bhairava is the pure expression of this very freedom that is intrinsic to our being. These hymns are dedicated to or evoke the same absolute freedom, recalling every instance of being and consciousness as mere expressions of the same freedom. At the end, the text is dedicated to rediscovering the freedom that is intrinsic to our being.

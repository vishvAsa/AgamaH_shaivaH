> How can we best negotiate these two dimensions of practice - on the one hand acknowledging the value and importance of our experiences and on the other hand not becoming stuck or succumbing to the belief that each such experience represents the achievement of the final goal?

- The first thing we need (which you have plenty) is humility.+++(5)+++ 
- And the second is, modern culture is all about experiences, finding all the means to capture a moment of experience, and be gratified once we have them. For us, enlightenment would be just another instant of self-gratification. We need to wake up from this self-gratification. But, how do we know if what we have experienced is even real then? A good question, also for me to ponder. The only way out is, you **test the teachings of your teacher and the Shastras on the basis of your experience**, but do not make your experience the ultimate measuring stick.+++(5)+++ Go back and double-verify your experiences on the basis of the teachings of your teachers and the texts. Each of these means is sufficient to enlighten us, but they alone cannot confirm if what we think we have is really what we have.

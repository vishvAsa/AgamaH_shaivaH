The senses occupy the centrestage in our existential space. In fact what we call transmigration, saṁsāra, is but the incessant flow of the present and future connection with body, sense-instruments and sense- objects.1 In breaking this nexus lies our achievement. That is precisely the starting point of any intellectual enquiry in India. 

To begin. The Kashmir Śaivist view of our world consists of thirtysix categories, twentyfour of which (from Prakṛti to Earth) are broadly adopted from Samkhya with systemal variations constituting impure or mayic or empirical world. Above Prakṛti lies Māyā, the principal power of obscuration and determination with its five part- revealing powers called pañca kañcukas, "sheaths", constitutive of the limited subjectivity of the individual subject. Beyond lie the five categories from Śiva to Śuddhā Vidyā in descending order forming the pure order of creation. The ultimate reality, called Parama Śiva or Maheśvara, is prakāśavimarśamaya, “unity of self-luminosity and self-consciousness", the principle of self-unfolding and self-enfolding I-consciousness. What is important for us to note, as pointed out by Maheśvarānanda, a great savant of Kashmir Śaivism from Chola, that all the tattvas, "categories,” from Śiva to Earth represent stages of gradual coagulation (styānibhāva) of the light of consciousness.2 Deriving seed idea from Somānanda,3 the

greatgrand teacher of Abhinavagupta, Maheśvarānanda understands by "coagulation" solidification or concretization in the form of growing predominance of objectivity consequent upon corresponding subjugation of subjectivity. Thus inter se distinction of all the categories consists in successively rising quantum of coagulation. Certain conclusions may be logically deduced from such a formulation. First, in Pṛthvī (“earth”), the grossest category, figure all the preceding thirtyfive categories from Śiva to Jala ("water") in the form of abiding causal residuam (kāraṇavāsanānuvṛttidvārā). Second, Śiva, the first ever emanation, contains all the succeeding thirtyfive categories from Pṛthvĩ to Śakti exactly as effects exist in cause, the way we find in the satkārya doctrine." Third, in respect of each of the intervening categories both these processes operate and as a result thereof respective categories, both above and below, mark their presence. Fourth, such a thesis supports and in return is reinforced by the Samkhya dictum, religiously adopted by the Kashmir Śaivist, "everything contains all things" (sarvam sarvātmakam). Thus each category contains all the thirtysix categories.10 This is important because the Jñänendriyas and Manas, belonging as they do to the intermediary realm of categories, are in themselves the graded manifestation of self-awareness geared to participate fully in the psychological, sociological and soteriological dispensation of the system. 

According to Utpaladeva, the first proponent of the Pratyabhijña system, the objective world, the world we are exposed to in our daily life, is an evolute of Prakrti or Pradhāna which is the root cause and is an undifferentiated unity of all that is object of knowledge. The cognizable reality consists of twentythree types divided into two classes of means and

effect. The means, comprising the external and internal, are thirteen in number and the group of effects is tenfold owing to its division into subtle and gross." The subtle effects stand for what is popularly known as tanmātrās and the gross for five elements (pañca mahābhūtas). Both of them are universals where former is cause-universal as clay (mṛt) in jar and may be likened to para-sāmānya, the latter is similarity-universal like jarness in a jar and may be likened to apara-sāmānya. Abhinavagupta in his Vivṛtivimaršini pointedly underscores the notion of subtlity and grossness. The subtle does not mean atomic in nature, but partless and pervasive as compared to the effect-class. The grossness is just the opposite.12 This criterion holds good elsewhere also vis-a-vis inter se relationship of the categories. Taking the perspectival overview of the role played by each constituent in whole psychological and epistemological process Abhinavagupta sums up "According to this system, the Abhāsas such as earth etc mixing up with one another, assume the form of a definite object, such as jar etc. They rest (viśrāmayanti) in the subject, when they are approached by organs of action, perceived by perceptive senses, desired by Manas, taken as "this" by Ahaṁkāra, ascertained by Buddhi, differentiated by (Aśuddha) Vidyā and affected by Kalā etc. This is the implication."13 Virtually reproducing this statement in his Vivṛti-vimarśinī with a significant addition he overturns the basic stance. He adds "Even though the objects achieve a sort of identity with the empirical subject through rest in him (as per the process outlined above) they, finally get reposed in the Real Self along the gradual melting away of the self-differentiations."14

As noted above, the two classes of karaṇa and kārya share one thing in common, that is, their cognizability. Even their genesis, Pradhāna, is also an object of yogins and super-empirical subjects. Through recourse to inferential reasoning they fall within the knowability frame-work of the worldly beings. In fact, the five kañcukas e.g. Kalā, Vidyā, Kāla, Rāga and Niyati, are really objects of knowledge but they are not so treated since they emerge as powers of the limited subject. Even the individual subject in the system is strictly speaking a meya, an object, but is projected as a subject, pramātā, since its objectivity is concealed in the context of our worldly transaction. 15 Another thing worth remembering is that these thirteen means and ten objects are products of Prakṛti and as such they are the effects of pleasure, pain and stupor because they are constitutive of our world of shared experiences essentially in the nature of pleasure, pain and stupor (sukha, duḥkha and moha).16 Another connected point that Abhinavagupta makes in his Tantrasāra is to draw attention to the twin facets of all the categories (tattva) from Kalā down to Pṛthvĩ which obviously include twentythree categories comprising two groups of the instruments and effects.17 These two facets are their Śakti-character and tattva- character. About the former we will talk later. A category represents essential nature of a thing, called universal, shining undivided in various groups of things and is responsible for their subsumption into one class. Vertically it may be pervasive as a cause or horizontally by providing common property. Thus each indriya, whether cognitive or motor, is a sort of universal consisting of a definitive modality of reception or action shared by all the members of its class and represents a kind of isomorphism. In vertical pervasion they exhibit an element of subtle causality. In Śaiva scheme of things there are three parallel but homologous layers. The first layer consists of jñātṛtva and kartṛtva (the absolute subjectivity and agency) which evolves into the second layer of Aśuddha Vidyā and Kalā (limited powers of knowerhood and agency of the individual subject) which further evolves into the third layer of Jñānendriyas and karmendriyas (cognitive and motor faculties).

this linear progression, the latter two may be viewed as constituting two corresponding horizontal structures in the sense that Vidya and Kalā, on the subjective side, are the counterparts of Jñanendriyas and karmendriyas on the objective side.18 

Jñānendriyas (faculties of sensing), and Manas have been discussed under the broad category of karana which includes Buddhi, Ahaṁkāra and Karmendriyas as well. Although Kashmir Śaivists are fully aware of the role of karana as a facilitator of the subjective functioning pramātuḥ pārvaṁ karaṇopayogaḥ,19 apparently no serious attempt seems to have been made to define the term.20 Generally it stands for the most congenial (sādhakatama or ekasädhana)21 or the sole instrument and accords with the meaning assigned to it by the science of grammar.22 It is only from this angle that a guru (spiritual guide) is described as karaṇa since he is the most instrumental to the dispensing of true knowledge.23 In the epistemic context this instrumentality is defined as pramāṇa, "means or source of knowing"24 and is extended to include Jñānendriyas25 as well as two internal means i.e., Manas and Buddhi whose common

Incidentaly an allusion may be made to a cosmogonical parallelism. The trans- māyic subjective entities like Rudras and Kṣetrajñas are deemed to occupy similar position as that occupied by senses in an organism. Just as an individual subject knows and acts upon the objective data provided by the manifold sense-faculties, the supreme godhead too knows and acts upon the cosmic objectivity grasped through innumerable Rudras and Kṣetrajñas who are like sense-organs: विचित्रबुद्धिकर्मेन्द्रियविषये हि यथा ज्ञातृत्वकर्तृत्वे एकस्यैवात्मनः तथेन्द्रियस्थानीयरुद्रक्षेत्रज्ञसहस्र- विषयस्य भावराशेर्यज्ज्ञानं करणं च तदेकत्र चिदात्मनि । IPV, II, p. 282.

function is to admeasure or size up the object.26 In the substantive-centric context karaṇa is a motivating or prompting factor,27 but in the process- centric area it is the sole or most conducive causal factor. 

It appears that by appropriating the grammarian's theory the Kashmir Saivist gives an edge to his notion of karaṇa. Karaṇa as sādhana helps in the accomplishment of an action. The chief "doer" of an action is the agent, but all other kārakas are also "do-ers" in the sense that they accomplish part of the action and thereby they acquire name of Karaṇa etc.28 The karaṇa is the most direct and effective helper in accomplishing the main action undertaken or contemplated by the agent. Besides Karaṇa is essentially of the nature of power, because whatever helps another and is dependent on it is power.29 Going by what the word conveys, the grammarian takes the things and their powers as distinct from one another. 

Taking cue and moving a step ahead, Abhinavagupta holds, that the power is called karaṇa when it fringes upon agency and is possessed with the essence of both the object as well as the agent.30 Among the three, kartā is he who prompts (preraka), karaṇa is what is prompted (prerya) and karma is the object of prompting (preraṇaviṣaya). If karaṇa were other than kartā, then even karma may be mistaken as karaṇa because it is semantically confusing to distinguish one that prompted from

With reference to the "binding" action whose object is the individual subject and agent is the universal subject (Śiva), Śakti emerges as karana bordering on and assimilating both and yet depending more on the agent : तत्र बन्धनक्रियायां ना नरो बध्यः, कर्मकर्त्रावेशमयी शक्तिश्च कर्तृतां स्पृशत्करणम्, शिवश्च कर्ता । TAV, V, p. 2308.

the one which is the object of prompting.31 An action is never without an instrument which must be different from the action. Now if the instrument is conceived to be different from the agent, it will necessarily lead to infinite regress, because the instrument being prerya will require someone else for prompting and the latter for doing the same, someone else. The Śaivist seeks a way out within the agential freedom. The agent's personality has two aspects one relating to the object (of action) and the other to the agent. Let us figure out what happens when one hears sound through one's sense or faculty of audition. Here the inidividual subject is the agent of hearing-action, sound is the object and auditory sense is the instrument. What happens is that the agent embarks upon self-differentiation and renders object-touching part of the self that is the sense organ for hearing (śrotra) which has affinity with sound into the instrument i.e., cognitive faculty, of hearing (jñänendriya).32 This process of self-instrumentalization is further extended to the external instruments where the agent with the aid of instrumentalized sensory and motor faculties identifies the walkman or axe etc. (which are quite different from agent) with his own self and instrumentalizes them also in the sense that they render exclusive service towards completion of action. 

33 

As we saw earlier, all the senses of cognition and those of motor activity are respective expansions of Asuddha Vidya and Kalā, the empirical subject's powers of limited knowledge and action.34 The latter two are considered general instruments (sāmānyakaraṇa) in respect of knowledge and action respectively, whereas Buddhīndriyas and Karmendriyas are particularized versions of Vidya and Kalā.35 The primary

instrumentality of Vidya and Kalā is amply evinced when a blind person has a generic apprehension of colour or form even though he is devoid of sense of vision and a lame that of movement, even though he is without his motor organs of locomotion. But it does not impair the role of Jñänendriyas and Karmendriyas because the blind and the lame, thereby, do not acquire definitive capacity to approach the external object, hence external senses (bahiṣkaraṇa) are the special or particular instruments.36 

Kashmir Śaivism subscribes to the commonly accepted division of instruments into two sets of inner psychic apparatus and external faculties, popularly known as antaḥkaraṇa and bahiṣkaraṇa. As the very name implies, antaḥkaraṇa is threefold37 - buddhi, ahaṁkāra and manas. The general ascertainment of the object is Buddhi. Ahaṁkāra is the attribution of ego-sense to the knower and the known. Manas is the cause of determinate resolution or will (samṁkalpana38) etc. The use of ādi (“etc.” in saṁkalpādi) is somewhat cryptic. Abhinavagupta nowhere explains it. But he did intend to include vikalpana also as a mental function becomes clear, if we go by what Maheśvarānanda says. As in the Samkhya-Kärikā, Abhinavagupta too does not distinguish between the function (vṛtti) and its functionary in the case of Buddhi and Ahaṁkāra, though he does see such a distinction in the case of Manas. But it will appear too naive to take it that way, because he underscores the causal relationship while describing the whole process to which we have referred to at the outset. Maheśvarānanda in his presentation sets all doubts aside treating them as being instrumental to their designated function.40

antaḥkaraṇa and other as bahiṣkaraṇa because all organs could be considered external because of their māyic origin. They could equally well be considered internal because of their serving the cause of the limited subject.41 According to Abhinavagupta, Utpaladeva considers that all the three, Manas, Ahaṁkāra and Buddhi, need be viewed as causal to the conceptualization of antaḥkaraṇa,42 because their operations are internal. An action requires instrument, and an internal action for that matter must require an internal instrument. Manas, Buddhi and Ahaṁkāra as constituting antaḥkaraṇa is in answer to that.43 

These internal functions cannot be discharged by external senses. Because in that case the external senses which, though external, have to turn inwards in order to facilitate occasioning of knowledge, resolution and ego-proclivity (bodha, eṣaṇa and saṁrambha) which fall within the exclusive domain of the internal senses.44 The problem is that the external senses apprehend (ālocanā) their respective objects separately, whereas the internal organs function collectively. How can the same set of senses (that is external) execute two different operations at the same point of time? Since in actual experience the two functions are synchronous the possibility of external donning the role of internal is to be ruled out.45 

Internality being common ingredient, one is tempted to ask, why not think of just one antaḥkaraṇa instead of three. According to Abhinavagupta this is not feasible because of their essentially diverse

functionality despite the fact that they all are directed to one single object.46 Abhinavagupta is quite emphatic in pointing out that they are structured to discharge three exclusive functions and demonstrates that the three roots i.e. klp "to bring about/to formulate", man "to be proud/ to think", syati "to ascertain/to determine" from which the three terms have been derived respectively denote three different meanings e.g. will, ego-proclivity and understanding, underlining the triple character of inner operation and as such vouchsafe for the three modes of instrumentality.47 This Abhinavan position on internality is at variance with that of Samkhya stalwarts like Vācaspati Misra for whom internality arises from their residing or being located within the body.48 One may not miss the patent physio-biological undertone of the Samkhya position. Abhinavagupta also calls in question the followers of Vindhyavāsin who consider Ahaṁkāra and Buddhi only as cause (kāraṇa) and not as instrument (karana). Contrary to this, Kashmir śaivism subscribes to the twofold character of antaḥkaraṇa as karaṇa and kāraṇa both. However, it is owing to the functional distinction (bhinnavṛttivaśāt) they are treated as three, otherwise they are in essence one. 49 Antahkarana, it may be posited, is a sort of composite unity whose separate aspects operate cooperatively in order to bring about a single effect.50 Hence in carving out the precise role of the internal organs as part of the psycho-epistemic process Abhinava invariably uses the term antaḥkaraṇa in singular

number.51 As a part of prādhānika tattvasarga52 (“order of creation rooted in Prakṛti ”) the order of emanation happens to be Buddhi, Ahaṁkāra and Manas but in objective grasp they function in reverse order, that is, Manas, Ahaṁkāra and Buddhi but as a composite functionary.53 The view is supported by Abhinavan appropriation of the principal-subordinate relationship doctrine advocated by Samkhya in relation to the internal organs vis-a-vis external sense organs. According to Samkhya the former is principal and the latter is subordinate which serves the cause of the former i.e. antaḥkaraṇa.54 Abhinavagupta, however, extends the application of dvāradvāribhāva even among the three internal organs as we noted above. In fact Abhinavagupta visualizes a homology that obtains between hieararchization of the constitutive powers of the limited subject with reference to the subjective functioning and different aspects of antaḥkaraṇa. Abhinavagupta, however, seems to say that though this order is fixed yet it may vary from subject to subject.55 

Maheśvarānanda thinks of a metaphor and likens antaḥkaraṇa with large waves, Jñānendriyas with waves and Karmendriyas with sub- waves or ripples.5% In so doing he comes out with a novel explanation. The three internal instruments are the individual subject's most conducive senses (sense-organs).57 Maheśvarānanda makes two points here. First, inner organs or internal instruments subserve the purpose of the subject/ agent. Two, karaņa is rendered in terms of sense-organs i.e., indriya. That is, the three antaḥkaraṇas happen to be indriyas of the limited subject at par with the external organs. This view again is not in agreement with the अन्त: करणेन ( and not अन्तःकरणैः ) सङ्कल्पिताभिमतनिश्चितरूपा: । IPV, II, p. 242; also see IPVV, III, p.304 : अन्तःकरणेन सङ्कल्पनाभिमनननिश्चयनपर्यन्ततां नीताः ।

known Samkhya position on the matter. The Samkhya holds only manas to be an indriya besides being karaṇa, whereas Buddhi and Ahaṁkāra are no doubt instruments, but not indriyas. The reason accorded is that the common orgin of Jñānendriyas alongwith Manas from sättvika ahaṁkāra offers a criterion for treating Manas to be an indriya. Etymologically that which is one's distinctive sign or mark is called indriya. But Manas is not an indriya in this sense because in that case it will overlap on Ahaṁkāra and Buddhi as well.58 But Kashmir Śaivism has no problem in taking all the internal organs as being mark or sign of the individual self. For him the "most efficaciousness" (sādhakatamatā) towards subjective purpose consists in extracting this-ness from objects and refurbishing them with I- ness (ahaṁtā).59 “Extracting thisness" means letting internal experience of the externally apprehended objects take place and "offering of I-ness" means helping the external object realize its self-luminous essence so as to enable it to become fit to discover its identity as a subject through the self-reflected subjective awareness. Maheśvarānanda names it as a "technique of sacralization" (pāvanīkaraṇa-yukti). It is like making a medicine sacred by uttering a mantra or mantra-empowering (abhimantraṇa) a prescribed medicine60 

61 

Among the internal organs Buddhi is first to emanate from Prakṛti. Śaivas make a subtle departure from Samkhya that they trace emanation of Buddhi to guņas and not to Prakṛti.61 Guņas they equate with the agitated Prakṛti, but this is a cosmogonical issue and we may better leave it at this point of time. Absolutely translucent, owing to its genesis from sattva, Buddhi receives reflection of both, the subjective light of the self-

luminous self and the object. 62 It may be noted, as aptly pointed out by Pandey, that Purusa here refers to the subject's individuated self unlike Sāmkhya's pure Purușa. The reflection of Puruşa is stated to be because of its immediacy. As a karaṇa, Buddhi receives reflection of the external objects through external sense-faculties as in the case of perception and without the intervention of the sense-organs as in the case of imagination, fancy or dream. In the latter event the external object is instantly produced on its own.63 Thus the mode of Buddhi (vṛtti) which is nothing but the capacity to bear the objective reflection transpires as bodha that manifests or illuminates the object. The difficulty is as to how Buddhi, which is an evolute of the (primordial) matter and as such is insentient, is able to manifest the object. The answer lies in Buddhi's synchronous ability to offer a base for the expression of subjective consciousness. It is by virtue of Buddhi's innate capacity to act as a locus for the reflection of the light of self-luminous consciousness that the modal apprehension (vṛttyātmā bodhaḥ), though inert, acquires capacity to illuminate or manifest the object.65 Jayaratha, therefore, deftly implies a fine distinction between the two instances of reflection. In receiving reflection of the object Buddhi only "bears" (pratibimbasahiṣṇutā) it because of its structural materiality, whereas in reflecting subjective consciousness it constitutes the "locus of reflection" (pratibimbādhāra).66 

The word bodha has been used as a synonym for adhyavasaya or avasāya“ and appears to have been identified with niscaya in Kashmir Śaiva circles.68 But as Ram Shanker Bhattacharya points out elsewhere

that it is not niscaya (determination) we are used to understand in ordinary usage, but a sort of generalized, non-specific objective perception.69 This is what Abhinavagupta wants to say when he defines Buddhi as "of the nature of ascertainment-in-general"70 which is grasping the object as non-specific "this"71 and not such and such. 

In its aspect as a cause (karaṇaskandhatayā) Buddhi gives rise to Ahaṁkāra (ego-sense) as abhimāna that is attributing the functions of Buddhi etc. to oneself i.e., the individuated self. Both the aspects of Buddhi which is the focal point of the manifestation of the light of the individuated self and whose characteristic function of receiving reflection of the object are always grasped as belonging to 'I' taking the form 'I do',72 'I know'. The agency that is responsible for the imposition of the self or subject on the functions of Buddhi is said to be Ahaṁkāra.73 

The extra-ordinary function of ahaṁkāra is called samrambha vṛtti which consists in controlling and prompting five vital airs and thereby the principle of life itself.74 

The notion of Ahaṁkāra carries added significance in Kashmir Śaivism. The nature of supreme self, as it is "self", is defined in terms of "I-ness" or "selfhood" (ahaṁtā or ahaṁbhāva) which is further figuratively paraphrased as 'resting of the self within the self.' Now Ahaṁkāra as a karaṇa and immediate evolute of Buddhi is different from ahaṁbhāva. Aham denotes freedom of pure consciousness whereas Ahaṁkāra is saṁraṁbha-vṛtti i.e., attribution of ego-feeling where it does

not belong and is enshrined in the inert Buddhi which is of the nature of not-self.75 Former is therefore hailed as spontaneous, whereas the latter is artificial. The latter operates in the world of shared realities divided into subject and object etc. and superimposes I-hood on both, whereas in the case of former it is beyond the realm of Buddhi and has no counterpositive to be contradistinguised from.77 

We have considered Ahaṁkāra's role as an instrument (karaṇa) but its role as cause (kāraṇaskandha) or source of sense-organs renders it all the more important, more so because it impacts and accounts for the kind of instrumentality they tend to exhibit in relation to the objectivity they come in contact with. Ahaṁkāra's causality is threefold rooted in the constituent three Guņas – sattva, rajas and tamas.78 In the model scheme of Sāmkhya Manas, Jñānendriyas and Karmendriyas evolve from the sāttvika ahaṁkāra, whereas rājasa helps promote evolution of both of them. In the ancient literature these three are more commonly known as vaikrta, taijasa and bhūtādi respectively. In the Tantrāloka, however, Abhinavagupta takes a different line. His first choice seems to trace origin/emergence of Manas and sense faculties to the sattva-dominated ahamkāra.79 However, later he shows his allegiances to the Mālinī-vijaya

tantra81 according to which sättvika, i.e. vaikārika in the traditional terminology, gives rise to all the external senses (i.e. sensory and motor). Likewise, rājasa ahaṁkāra, called taijasa, is source of Manas while tāmasa gives rise to Tanmātrās. But this stand of the Mālinīvijayottara-tantra, which was held in great esteem by Trika philosophers as the Śrīpurvaśāstra, was vulnerable to several interpretations. Abhinavagupta refers to two differing interpretations. The view mentioned above represented one line of interpretation.82 The other line of interpretation came by transposing the meaning of the two terms. Taijasa, on this interpretation, stood for sättvika and vaikārika for rājasa.83 On this view Manas originated from sättvika, and Jñānendriyas and Karmendriyas from rājasa. In both the views tanmātrās proceeded form tāmasa, by implication. The great Śaiva Siddhāntin, Saddyojyoti, put up another interpretation and traced Karmendriyas to rājasa, Jñānendriyas and Manas to sättvika and tanmātrās and mahabhutas to tāmasa.84 Abhinava finally gets out of this ambivalence by upholding taijasa as rājasa and vaikārika as sāttvika and thereby holding that Manas was the product of rājasa ahaṁkāra whereas all the senses, irrespective of their division into sensory and motor, emanated from sättvika.85 But ambivalence does not seem coming to an end. What is intriguing that he adopts a different tune

in the Tantrasăra.86 Accordingly Manas and Jñānendriyas have their source in sattvika ahaṁkāra. However, in the case of Manas, sättvika ahaṁkāra is qualified by tamasa ahaṁkāra. Karmendriyas too evolve from the same source except that in this case, sättvika ahaṁkāra is qualified by the upsurge of the tanmātrā element. As to the Abhinavagupta's definite view, one may have to explore further since the two vimarśinīs are also of no help. 

One way of steering clear through the two discordant stands taken by Abhinavagupta himself seems to restrict his interpretation of the Mālinīvijayottara Tantra to the Mālinīvijayottara itself and take it as his final position in the scriptural exegesis, but go by the stand he took earlier in the Tantraloka (TA 9/234)87 propounding rise of Manas and Jñānendriyas from sättvika ahaṁkāra as a representative position of the system. This accords with the stand taken by him in the Tantrasära. But the only difficulty is that in the Tantrāloka at this juncture he does not disclose his view about the source of Karmendriyas. Another difficulty is that it would be very daring on the part of Abhinavagupta to deviate from the position, which the source text Mālinīvijayottara is said to have had on the strength of his own interpretation. For the time being we proceed with the view that appears to be the general approach of the system and where the two texts Tantraloka and Tantrasāra - conform to one another: i.e. Manas and all the senses have their source in sättvika ahaṁkāra. 

Coming to Manas we have already seen that it is a product of Ahamkāra where the sattva predominates. Reading Abhinavagupta together with Maheśvarānanda we had occasion to note that Manas happens to be instrumental to saṁkalpana and vikalpana.88 Yogarāja adds manana, “reflection", to this list of functions.89 What is the exact meaning 86. प्रकृतिस्कन्धस्तु तस्यैव त्रिविधः सत्त्वादिभेदात् । यत्र सात्त्विको यस्मात् मनश्च बुद्धीन्द्रियपञ्चकं च, तत्र मनसि जन्ये सर्वतन्मात्रजननसामर्थ्ययुक्तः स जनकः । [...] उद्रिक्ततन्मात्रभागविशिष्टात् तु सात्त्विकादेव अहंकारात् कर्मेन्द्रियपञ्चकम् । – TS, p. 77

of the word is not clear except that it must express a meaning which ought to be cognate with samkalpa. In this context we find two terms used by Abhinavagupta, namely, anuvyavasāya" “reformulating/retrospecting," and antaryojana “internal organizing or synthesizing” which seem to be quite close to manana or saṁkalpana-vikalpana. We propose to discuss these notions a little later. In the Samkhya texts, saṁkalpana is depicted as "proper construing" that is "determinate anlysis of the qualifying attributes and the qualified.""1 By contrasting it with the generalized non- specific ascertainment (adhyavasāyasāmānya) one may get a clearer idea of the function of Manas. 

Kashmir Śaiva philosophers intend to hammer out two important implications when they state that Manas and five sense-faculties are the products of sattva-dominated ahaṁkāṛa. First, sattva because of its inherent capacity to receive the subjective reflection, in a sense, imbibes subjective ambience (bhoktraṁśasparsin).92 Being an off-shoot of the sattva-dominated ahaṁkāra, Manas and Jñānendriyas too inherit affinity with the subject. Second, the word 'dominated' (in sattva-dominated) implies subdued presence of rajas and tamas marking cooperative functioning of Manas and Jñānendriyas.93 

A question arises, when Manas is at par with five Jñanendriyas because of its common origin from sättvika ahaṁkāra, why is it that Manas grasps all objects (sarvaviṣaya), whereas other Jñänendriyas grasp their earmarked respective objects (niyataviṣaya) alone? This question has been raised in Samkhya also. It is why Vyasa, in his Yoga-bhāṣya describes manas as ‘sarvārtha' i.e., which has objects of all the senses for its objects.94 We are not aware of the explanation offered by Sāṁkhya, but Abhinavagupta does try to find an answer. This he sees happening because of their having common origin. Owing to their mutually

interdependent functioning, Ahaṁkära and Manas reach out to all objects. Besides, sättvika ahaṁkāra, qualified by tamas and rajas, causes Manas take on some element of subjectivity thereby becoming knower or grasper (grāhaka/bhoktā) in respect of all objects. In the same manner tāmasa ahaṁkāra, qualified by sattva and rajas, is the genesis of all tanmātrās constituting objects of knowing (grähya). Since both the subject and object (grāhaka and grähya) have common source (internally differentiated only on the basis of guna-predominance), Manas is capable of covering all objects." Jayaratha, drawing support from an unidentified 96 arrives at two logical deductions: (a) All these are functionally interdependent, work in cohesion and have ubiquitous reach, and (2) As all tanmātrās originate from Ahaṁkāra, Manas is led to assume the mantle of the subject, and the sounds etc. that of the object.97 In case of Jñānendriyas Abhinavagupta again goes back to their origin. According to him as against the "property of being the producer of all objects-in- general" (tanmātrakartṛtvavaisiṣtya) which is the driver of Manas, the Jñānendriyas are driven by the "property of being the producer of a specific object-in-general" or, in other words, the "property of functioning in a specific objective mode” (tattadvṛttivaiśiṣtya) of Ahamkāra is what that drives the particular cognitive sense. In both situations it is the specialized modality of the production from Ahaṁkāra which spells their definite respective character.98 

According to Abhinavagupta the definitive function of Manas may be precisely conceptualized as "inner synthecizing" or "internal organizing" (antaryojana).” As against all the external senses, whether sensory or motor, whose function is essentially external and consists of their capacity to have sensation or indeterminate apprehension, the exclusive function of Manas remains internal. This perhaps explains why

Manas is reckoned to be part of the internal instrument. This inner functioning is formulated in terms of "configuring, organizing (antaryojana ) ” which is grounded on duality-unity relationship. 100 Jayaratha has this illustration. Suppose somebody speaks a word in the wake of sensation or indeterminate perception by Jñanendriyas, this synthesizing construction that “I speak” or “ I am speaking " is an activity which relates to two discrete moments which, in themselves, are indeterminate. But the moment the two are related through the unifying subjective substratum identified with the level of Buddhi, etc. the statements such as 'I speak' represent the first determinate action after the indeterminate sensory grasp.101 "Thus I who first had immediate experience of sound, am speaking (a word, sentence)', is indicative of mental or inner synthesis. This is what one understands by antaryojana. Even an analysis of the statement i.e., 'I speak' (ahaṁ vacmi) conveys that the “word” which is the object of “I speak” first descends from I, the doer, to the sphere of the object "word" being connected by the activity “speak” distinguishing the speaker from the dumb. The elernent of determinacy in the speech-act is a sort of mental function of the empirical or mayic subject owing to its determinacy. 

Abhinavagupta's formulation is inspired by his grand teacher Utpala Deva who maintains that "Manas, reacting (on what has been received through external senses) produces the mental constructs such as action which rest on unity and multiplicity and are primarily due to the activity of the subject".102 This also follows that the determinate process begins with the selection by Manas of some parts out of the mass reflected on Buddhi.103 Thus all dependent categories such as action, relation etc 100. इयांन्स्तु विशेषः यत् बुद्धीन्द्रियेषु आलोचनानुपाती वचनादिरूपः क्रियांशः परिस्फुरति स सर्व एव बुद्ध्यादिप्रमातृविश्रान्तिसतत्त्वो भेदाभेदमयसंबंधमूलोऽन्तर्योजनात्मा मनसो व्यापारः । TAV, IV,

are based on one-many phenomenon and in that sense they are all mental (mānasī). 

As we are going to see, the distinctive function of Jñanendriyas is said to be alocana, "indeterminate perceiving". Why then, a question naturally arises, a jar is selected to the exclusion of the rest of the presentation. The answer Kashmir Śaivist proffers is that it is because on that part alone of the whole presentation that the mind has acted.104 This acting of Manas is named as anuvyavasaya which is identical with the notion of antaryojana and is used in a sense different from the Naiyāyika's. This involves the residual traces of the previous indeterminate experience which becomes part of the personality of the subject of the determinate experience and as such is carried through the process till the determinate knowledge has reached its conclusion. The three stages are thus vyavasāya (i.e., alocana) by the senses, anuvyavasāya by Manas and niscaya by Buddhi.105 The precise function of Manas is to evaluate and sort out the inputs from the senses and forward them duly evaluated to Buddhi for final conclusion. This is what constitutes the emperical subjectivity. 

A question of enormous importance haunts us at this juncture: Is the relationship that Manas has with both classes of the senses 

i.e., cognitive and motor the same or different? Although the question has not been framed in this form in the Pratyabhijñā circles, they seem to be aware of the problem. What precise answer they would have, is a matter to be worked out. But it may be said that in the case of Jñānendriyas Manas interacts with the indeterminate mass of sensations, whereas in the case of Karmendriyas it interacts with the first determinate activity, because motor activity invariably arises in the wake of indeterminate apprehension,106 though being determinate it is always mental.107

The external sense organs, specially the sensory ones, are the most important visible components of the microcosmic instrumentality represented by a human being. In the empirical world of shared realities perceptibility of an object by the external sense distinguishes individual subjects and at the same time ensures common meeting ground of all the percipients.108 Because of the full participation by the external senses the perception of the individual subject does not encounter any impediment, there is clarity and continuity and hence it is common to all subjects. 109 No doubt there is a psychological inner world of every human being and also a metempirical order of the pure subjects but their visibility is obscured as if accessible only to the inner organs and thereby lacking fitness for the worldly transactions.110 Likewise the privation of knowledge concomitant with misapprehension, lack of apprehension or epistemic error or even common optical illusions all are offshoots of the non-participation or incomplete participation of the external senses. 

Kashmir Śaivism incorporates several general premises of Sāmkhya, of course with different systemic implications, in this regard. These are not mere physical faculties, they are much more, having not only psychological but even spiritual dimensions. They are conceived as powers of the individual. Both these features apply to motor faculties as well. Coming closer to own turf, the sense- faculties of cognition are manifestation of Asuddha Vidya (the subjective power of knowledge), and

the motor faculties that of Kalā (the subjective power of agency) both belonging to the individualized self. These will be discussed on the appropriate occasion. 

Kashmir Śaivism shows more liking for the term buddhīndriya vis- a-vis jñanendriya."11 the apparent reason appears to be that jñana is far more extensive term and goes much beyond Buddhi, in the categorial hierarchy envisaged in the system. In the Vivṛti, as quoted by Abhinavagupta, Utpaladeva restricts the instrumental role of the cognitive sense-organs to buddhibodha, that is, knowledge as caused by Buddhi (i.e., buddhigatabodha).112 Abhinavagupta defines buddhīndriya as one which is useful (upayogi) in the knowledge of object-specific (such as sound) determination.113 What does this word upayogi ("useful") denote, is nowhere explained. By appropriating the terse Sämkhya terminology in the Isvarapratyabhijñā-Vivṛti-vimarśinī, as far as understood by us, Abhinavagupta seems to take it as being useful (i.e. instrumental) to the knowing object such as smell etc., which are transformations of Buddhi.114 As karaṇa the only function that has been attributed to the senses of cognition is alocana (sensation/indeterminate perception).115 Since no other upayoga is in sight, we take it as being useful in alocana (perception characterised by immediacy). Adding a bit of metaphorical flavour Maheśvarānanda likens these sense organs with lamps because of their profuse illuminating power. Illumination lies in being instrumental to grasping of the specific objects such as sound, touch, colour, taste and smell respectively.116 

111. The use of jñānendriyas is not completely ruled out. They have been so termed because of the predominance of jñāna. See MMP.62, Nonetheless a marked pref- erence for buddhīndriya is there.

The term alocana in the context is a legacy from Sāṁkhya. While quoting Samkhya-Kārikā 27117 which according to Vacaspati discusses the exclusive function (asādhāraṇī vṛtti) of the cognitive sense organs, Abhinavagupta gets a chance to examine the very basis of naming them as buddhīndriya. Asks he, why these be not called alocanendriya instead of buddhīndriya or jñanendriya118 and replies that they are so called because they happen to be conducive to the occasioning of knowledge by buddhi. He goes on to explain: because the objective knowledge is effected by virtue of the senses having determinate knowledge for their essence, they are named buddhīndriya.119 Even if this argument be conceded, the senses are totally beyond cognitive reach for the three reasons, namely that (i) they have unique identity constituted by their exclusive functionality in the first place, (ii) they are the products of ahaṁkāra in the second place, and (iii) they are the powers of the inner self in the third place. How could then we conclude that determinate knowledge constitutes their essence.120 Kashmir Śaivism too does not subscribe to their adhyavsāya-character in or because of these forms. Instead, they acquire the adhyavasaya-character because of their modification into or assumption of the forms of their specific objects. Having transformed themselves into objective form, they enter buddhi and deposit objective form in buddhi, thereby they become instrumental to and identical with the determinate perception.121 It is bodha (determinate knowledge) that vouches for their utility in our daily transactions and not alocana.122 Though alocana still remains seminal to the completion of bodha, it is not the ground enough to designate it as ālocanendriya in preference to buddhīndriya. Echoing Utpaladeva, Abhinavagupta firmly believes that alocana extends upto determinate knowledge defining buddhi but not upto culmination into subject

(pramātṛviśrānti).123 It may be noted that the percept "I have known the object" occurs only after it comes to rest in the subject. Thus, for Abhinavagupta adhyavasaya constitutes the outmost fringe of objective ascertainment. 124 Hence, concludes Abhinavagupta, designating sense- organs as buddhīndriya agrees with both, determinate knowledge (addhyavasaya = svarūpa essential nature) and alocana (darśana viewing exclusive function of the sense organ).125 

www 

A word of caution will be in place here. The assumption of specific objective forms by the senses (svaviṣayākārapariņāma) is what is understood by the word alocana and what constitutes the sole mode in which the distinctive sensory function is presented. This is occasioned by the inherent power of the external senses. This is precisely the point where Kashmir Śaivist departs from Samkhya. In Samkhya it is psychosis, buddhivṛtti – modal transformation of intellect, here it is the functioning mode of the senses i.e., akṣavṛtti, that grasps the object. 126 The empirical knowledge or perception (jñana) is defined as that light of consciousness when it is limited by senses which perceive only what is clear, and by clearly figuring external object.127 Apart from environmental factors this clarity in large part stems from the structural affinity between a particular sense and its object. The idea of alocana comes under special focus from another angle also. Abhinavagupta distinguishes between the 

powers 

of individual subject such as kalā, kāla etc., and the powers called "senses”. Both "touch" the object, former universally and the latter particularly as specific object of knowledge.128 Here "touch" is obviously not a tactile 123. ननु च आलोचनमेव इयति मूलमिति कस्मात् न व्यपदेश: । अत्र आह "आलोचनमात्रेण" इति बुद्ध्यवसायपर्यन्ततामागच्छता । तेन बुद्धो मम अयमर्थः इति न प्रमातृविश्रान्तिः तस्यां तु सत्यां सा भवतीति । - ibid, cp. बुद्धीन्द्रियैरालोचिता:, अन्तःकरणेन संकल्पनाभिमनननिश्चयनपर्यन्ततां नीताः ।

proposition. Then what it is, let us explore. Perhaps that will make the idea of indriyavṛtti, "sensory function," clearer. 

ālocana, prakāśana and avabhāsana – these are cognate words, not only semantically, but etymologically and conceptually as well. The primary function of the sense organ is to receive reflections of the external objects, that is the reflecting constitutes vṛtti of the senses. Reflecting is essentially an act of manifesting or illuminating the object. As an end-product, manifesting depends upon the inner organs which “grace" the sense and sense which in turn “graces" the object and, as a process, it is the other way round where the object is graced by the sense and which, likewise, is graced by the inner organs. 

129 Simply put, 

immediacy or indeterminacy of perception (ālocana) is nothing but the reflection of the object received by the sense. In this respect, not only optical sense organ but, for that matter, all the cognitive sense organs receive the reflections of their specific external objects. 130 

Kashmir Śaivism clearly maintains distinction between the physical and the psychological. As such the optical sense is different from eye- balls. The reflective process consists of three tiers relating, as it does, (as for example in the case of visual perception) to retina, sense of vision and intellect. All the three receive reflection of the object. However the image on retina is different from the image on the optical sense. Similarly, the latter i.e., the image on the optical sense (for that matter any sense organ) is different from the one on Buddhi. While former is the cause, latter is the effect, one is physical and the other is psychological.131 Therefore any statement about the illumination of an object is an assertion of its image on the sense.

When a perception occurs, the process that takes place is somewhat like this. First a person confronts an object. The internal organ is the promoter or driver that sets the appropriate sense to work.132 The sense, then, comes in touch with its object which is nothing but the reflection of the external object on the sense-organ and receives its reflection.133 This physical image is then illumined by the light of consciousness and casts its reflection through that light on Buddhi. This illumination by the subjective light is termed as the reflection of the individual knowing self.134 Now we are in a purely psychological realm. This results into indeterminate knowledge i.e., the consciousness of the light of knowledge having been affected. It is called indeterminate knowledge, because it is not possible to say at this stage as to what exactly is the cause of the affection of the pure light of knowledge."135 

137 

Thus it will be a misnomer to treat these senses as physical. Abhinavagupta enters into long polemic with the Naiyāyikas136 and cites five reasons to counter and reject the physicality of the sense organs. Since this discussion is not germane to our present treatment we leave it here. As pointed out earlier the exclusivity and determination of the

At this point it might be worthwhile to look into an important observation by Abhinavagupta. The objects are primary driver or prompters of the sense-function- ing (external as well as internal) which is impossible to achieve without the active involvement of the appropriate subject. The six sheaths (kañcukas) that include kalā and vidyā turn out to be the instrument for channelizing the subjective involvement :

objective field of each sense is accounted for in terms of its rise from the ego-sense as qualified by the respective functional modalities.138 In stead of bhautika they could best be described as āhaṁkārika.139 It is why, as noted by Maheśvarānanda, even when there is no bodily effort these 138. तत्तद्वृत्तिविशिष्टाहंकारजन्यतयैव विषयनियमस्य सिद्धत्वात् हेतोः । 



ibid. 

Like their counterparts in the other philosophical traditions, Kashmir Śaivists also talk of indriya-niyama and viṣaya-niyama. Though essentially serving the identical purpose, the former pertains to the object-specific functional modality of the senses and the latter to the specificity of resulting sensory perceptions or sensations. We may also alternatively say that the first relates to the definitive nature of the respective senses, whereas the second to the determination of the objective content of the cognition. The rule that governs this order or classification could be understood in one of the three ways - e.g. (i) in terms of causation or cosmologi- cal causation, (ii) in terms of fitness, or (iii) in terms of definitional limit or extent. The first alternative draws out notice to the fact that every sense has a definite element (mahābhūta) as its material cause. The essential property of this material cause (element) would form the object of this sense. This alternative has variant also which consists in progressively incremental objective field occasioned by the gradual addition of the essential property of the successive element ( कार्यं पृथिवी, आप: तेजो, वायु:, नभः इति पञ्चभूतानि । सूक्ष्ममेषामेव रूपं गन्धो, रसो, रूपं, स्पर्शः, शब्दः इति । तत्रैकैकगुणम् आकाशादि, एकैकवृद्धगुणं वा इति दर्शनभेदः । - ई. प्र. वि., २, पृ. २४२ ) In this case the stock example is that of colour forming the specific object of the visual or optical perception. This is thoroughly causal in the sense that the colour element is the material cause of the sense of vision and sense of vision is the cause of visual perception. The second alternative emphasizes the fitness component of a sense. An eye is fit to generate knowledge of colour or form alone and none else. The third alternative, similarly, defines or sets limit or extent to the precise reach of a sense in respect of its object. Had it not been so, each sense could reach out to any or every object destroying the very basis of fivefold functional division of sense-faculties and thereby the fivefold division of ensuing cognitions : [.....] इति इन्द्रियनियमो हीयेत । स हि त्रिविधः प्रसिद्धः । इन्द्रियबलात् ज्ञानस्य कार्यस्य नियम: चक्षुर्जनितं हि ज्ञानं रूपस्य एव प्रकाश इति । इन्द्रियस्य च नियमो योग्यतात्मा येन नयनं रूपज्ञानमेव जनयति न अन्यदिति । इन्द्रियाणां च नियम इयत्ता षडिन्द्रियाणि इत्यादि [.....] । इन्द्रियाणां स्वभावे नियमाभावात् तज्ज्ञानानां च विषयनियमाभावात् चक्षुर्ज्ञानस्य सर्वविषयाभासनसामर्थ्यादनेकेन्द्रियकल्पना व्यर्था । -- IPVV, I, p. 230. The obvious casuality of the absence of indriya-niyama would be that there would be no blind or deaf on earth : इन्द्रियनियमाभावे च अन्धाद्यभावप्रसङ्गः, एकदा च अवलोकितविषयस्य तद्विषयतदनुभवनाशेऽपि तत्स्फुटीभावप्रसङ्गः इति न किंचित् कस्यचित् नष्टं स्यादिति । - ibid, p. 231. In Kashmir śaivism visaya - niyama means that the sensory objective field is not conceived purely as physical but as a product of ego-sense characterised by the specific sensorial modality.

sense organs are capable of grasping their objects. 140 Identifying particular organs with particular senses and designating them accordingly is simply to recognize their marked congeniality and proneness towards respective objects. 141 

In Kashmir Śaivism a lot of attention has been paid to the several ancillary issues which have some bearing on Jñänendriyas. We propose to have a brief overview and make certain passing references. Both internal and external instruments as well as their objects are part of categorial hierarchy comprising thirtysix categories from Śiva to Earth in descending order. Although this category-world represents two parallel lines of creation of subjective and objective, intrinsically it is objective in character by definition, by virtue of its being a category. These categories fall under three groups i.e., pure, pure-impure and impure, belonging as they do to the corresponding orders of creation. Closely running parallel to them are three groups of their subjects. A tabular view may be presented as under:

phenomenal world. This is mayic or empirical world. Kashmir Śaivism agrees with the Samkhya dictum that alocana is the gateway (dvāra) through which we get access to antaḥkaraṇa (dvārin) and confines them to the realm of Māyā i.e., the realm of empirical beings. 143 In this mayic world they are also known as deha-pramātā. Prāṇa-pramātā, buddhi- pramātā and śūnya-pramātā are the sub-types of pralayākalā. From pralayakala onwards there is no gross body or sense. Buddhipramātā and prāṇapramātā mark the initial stages of sūnyapramātā, boasting generalized sensation in which Jñänendriyas have no role, though Buddhi continues to persist as inner organ. 

144 

There are two aspects of the senses: (i) internal and (ii) external. The driving power of the vital airs is the internal vṛtti common to both, sense organs and motor organs. The external vṛtti of Jñānendriyas is alocana. The former is also called jīvana i.e., life. When ahaṁtā concentrates on prāṇa it constitutes puryaṣṭaka, "the subtle body". There are two views about the intrinsic constitution of puryaṣṭaka. Accordingly, the respective components may be either 

(i) 

(ii) 

5 vital airs + group of 5 sense-organs + group of 5 motor organs + Buddhi, or 

5 Tanmātrās + Manas + Buddhi + Ahaṁkāra 

The first variety belongs to the Pratyabhijñā school. The second variety is related to the Spanda system. However it is the first type where the Jñānendriyas have a role to play, howsoever insignificant. Buddhi too is operative, but Manas and Ahaṁkāra are totally out of the picture. This represents the consensual view of Kashmir Śaivism. 

A discussion about the subjects naturally invites a reference to the experiential states. Out of the five (Kashmir Śaivism admits a state beyond turya, the fourth, also corresponding to the absolutic state of Parama Śiva) states, Jñānendriyas are fully operative only in the wakeful state. As against deep sleep (suṣupta), which is devoid of the patent objectivity, the

gross objectivity is fully manifest in the wakeful and sleeping states.145 However, in sleep or dream state the physical role of sense-organs is virtually nil. The external senses remain shut or inactive in the sleeping person eliminating physical activity. Hence Manas alone grasps the objects as vividly as if they were the objects of the external senses.146 Because of the non-participation of the external senses, the dream world represents extraordinary mental creation and its perception remains closed to other percipients.147 This restricts the role of ego-sense and intellect also. So determinate perception (niścaya) is there, but not its continuity (niścayānuvṛtti) and conformation to the external objects. 

But the wakeful state which is a full-blooded state of empirical existence is not only replete with objective vividity in perception, it also boasts of shared and common reality, an open participatory world for all the percipients.148 This is because of the uncontradicted, unsublated operation of the external senses with full cooperation of the internal organs. There is clarity, continuity of determinate perception and hence it is common to all subjects.149 Such a view also prompts Kashmir Śaivist to treat wakeful state as a symbol of relative continuity of perception. The wakeful state lasts only so long as there is continuity of certainty in regard to reality of existence of external objects. When the continuity of consciousness of certainty is broken it becomes a dream state.150 

The unique strength of Kashmir Śaivism lies in its valuation as a great esoteric discipline, a deep aesthetic spirituality, besides having a life- affirming philosophical world view. There are broadly three contexts of the system 

ontological, cosmological and personal.151 Ontologically 145. नन्वेवं स्फुटवेद्यपदविनिर्मुक्ता सुषुप्तावस्थास्तु, स्वप्नजाग्रद्दशयोस्तु स्फुटवेद्यावभासयोगिन्योः को भेदः ।

reality, that is, Parama Śiva is an integral harmony of self-luminosity and self-referring consciousness, technically known as prakāśa and vimarśa. Cosmologically the two streams of creation - represented by Cosmic Time and Space or Word and Meaning (deśādhvan/kälädhvan or sabdadhvan/ arthādhvan) parallel one another vertically and horizontally - of which categorial ecclecticism is a vital component informed by Śiva and Sakti in a descending order of dispensing divinity or in an ascending order of actualizing the same. Personally the polarity between the individual body and the world of other bodies is replicated in I-this, subject-object configuration. All the three contexts are fused in the notion of human body endorsing and enforcing the homology between the microcosm (mind-body complex) and macrocosm. In this context Kashmir Śaivism envisages an extremely meaningful role for the senses, specially on the soteriological and epistemological considerations. 

As we noted earlier that the senses have two forms subtle and gross (sūkṣma and sthūla). In the subtle aspect they are the sense-powers (indriyaśaktis), that is, they are powers of Śiva, the Godhead, because He is the essence of the empirical subject. In gross aspect they are the powers of the individual subject.152 Hence they are the particularized articulations of the power of I-conciousness (ahaṁvimarśa) and they constitutively belong to the realm of Vimarśa.153 It is this latter aspect that has epistemological bearing and which is our main concern for the present.

- Consciousness is all pervading. It is inherently self aware (=vimarśa), otherwise it would be no better than a lamp. 
- In the ideal realm, there are generalized objects, generalized space and generalized time. Consciousness projects these outside, giving rise to specific objects in specific space and time.
  - Poets are somehow able to access these generalized objects.

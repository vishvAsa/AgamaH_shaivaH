  <p>THE LORD SIVA is not limited the way we humans are. Theological de scriptions of Siva emphasize that the many limitations we experience as  embodied human beings in a state of bondage do not in any way affect  Siva. Human beings are limited in time; Siva is eternal, without beginning,  middle, or end. Our human bodies are confined in space; Siva is pervasive,  omnipresent. As paSus, we are constrained by fetters; Siva is eternally with out mala, liberated without beginning. Humans are characteristically agi tated by psychic disturbances, alternately attracted and repulsed by the  things of the world; Siva is completely calm. We humans are always de pendent on and subordinate to other beings; Siva is the one completely  independent, autonomous being. Humans possess finite capacities; Siva&rsquo;s  powers of knowledge and action are infinite. Ultimately, Siva is not  bounded even by our capacity to conceptualize him. Siva is the one &ldquo;whose  domain surpasses our speech and mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a transcendent god cannot, according to Śaiva siddhanta, be wor shiped directly. He cannot be said to have a particular form, and it is not  possible for humans to meditate upon or offer worship to a completely form less being. According to a text quoted by Aghorasiva, &ldquo;It is only to the  extent that You possess a visible form that one is able to approach You. The  intellect cannot approach something lacking any visible form.&ldquo;1 Yet for  Śaiva worship to take place, it is absolutely necessary that Siva enter into  the ritual domain. He must be present to receive the offerings of his  worshiper.</p>
<p>This is the problem at the heart of invocation (avahana): how does one  summon a divinity that is by definition limitless into a limited sphere of  ritual, so that a bound human of limited powers may offer him worship? The  problem is both theological and procedural, a concern for both knowledge  and action. And the solution Śaiva siddhanta texts offer, likewise, provides  both a way of knowing Siva and of invoking his presence.</p>
<p>THE THEOLOGY OF SIVA&rsquo;S PRESENCE</p>
<p>In its description of Siva&rsquo;s &ldquo;inherent form,&rdquo; the Ajitagama pointedly pro claims that he is &ldquo;not bound by space, time, or the like&rdquo; and that &ldquo;his  domain surpasses speech and mind&rdquo; (AA 2.26-27). Similarly, the Svayam bhuvdgama describes Siva&rsquo;s &ldquo;essence&rdquo; (tattva) as &ldquo;unfathomable, inde-</p>
<p>Summoning the Lord * 113</p>
<p>scribable, incomparable, without defect, subtle, pervasive, eternal, firm,  imperishable, and lordly.&ldquo;2 As Sivagrayogin elaborates,</p>
<p>Siva is unfathomable because he is without end; indescribable because he is not  to be characterized (alaksya); incomparable because there is nothing like him;  without defect because he has no mala; subtle because he is not perceivable  {anupalabhya)·, pervasive because ubiquitous; eternal because he is devoid of  cause; firm because unmoving; imperishable because he is complete; lordly be cause he is master of the world. ($Pbh p. 62)</p>
<p>The emphasis that Śaiva theology places on the unlimited qualities of  Siva raises a difficult question concerning human access to Siva. Character izations of Siva place him in a domain far beyond human powers of know ing and acting. If Siva is unfathomable, indescribable, incomparable, and  imperceivable, what means do we have to know him? How can we offer  worship to a god who is imperceivable, pervasive, unmoving, and com plete? How do humans of limited powers gain access to one who surpasses  all limits?</p>
<p>Two Levels of Siva</p>
<p>The only ultimate resolution of this enigma lies in the liberation of the soul.  When the soul attains mok$a, the limitations that normally inhibit its powers  are removed, and the soul is able to approach Siva fully, just as he is. (Yet  in liberation, the agamas remind us, one &ldquo;does nothing&rdquo; because &ldquo;there is  nothing to be done.&ldquo;3 Offering piija, for instance, is an act appropriate to  bound souls, not to liberated ones.) Since we are not liberated, however, it  is necessary to address the quandary posed by Siva&rsquo;s unlimited nature and  our limited powers from the perspective of bondage. Human knowledge and  action presuppose limitation, yet it is nevertheless crucial for us to approxi</p>
<p>mate the infinite as best we can.</p>
<p>Śaiva philosophers deal with the epistemological problem by first distin guishing two levels of Siva. The first level, said to be true in the highest  sense (paramarthika), is the limitless, transcendent ParamaSiva (&ldquo;Highest  Siva&rdquo;) described in the passages above: a formless, undifferentiated Para ma£iva &ldquo;without parts&rdquo; (niskala). Positive knowledge of Siva at this level is  beyond human reach. Siva is said to be &ldquo;unfathomable,&rdquo; the Vatulagama  tells us, &ldquo;because he surpasses every human means of knowledge.&ldquo;4 The  Acintyagama elaborates, &ldquo;Siva&rsquo;s highest nature cannot be known through  observation (adhyaksa), nor from its marks (IiAga), nor through verbal author ity (Sabda).&ldquo;5 Descriptions of ParamaSiva are therefore essentially negative  ones, pointing to the absence of any limiting qualities.</p>
<p>Similarly, worship of Siva at this level is impossible. &ldquo;It is not possible,&rdquo;  says AghoraSiva, &ldquo;to meditate on or give worship and the like to an entity114 · ChapterFour</p>
<p>without form&rdquo; (TPV 6). Considered in his highest state, ParamaSiva sur passes the capacities of bound pasus.</p>
<p>The second level of Siva, true only as a partial approximation or synec doche (upacara), is Siva as he is understood to manifest himself and act in  multiple ways upon the world: a differentiated Siva &ldquo;with parts&rdquo; (sakala).  The agamas stress the completeness of Siva&rsquo;s activities affecting the world  and everything in it. He is the &ldquo;unique seed of the world,&rdquo; that is, the instru mental cause of all creation (TP 1), and the one who grants all grace. He  performs the five fundamental activities that set in motion the most essential  processes of the cosmos and of souls.</p>
<p>It is through this active presence in the world that Siva becomes accessi ble to humans. Embodied souls do not generally perceive Siva&rsquo;s activities  directly, but we are able to observe the many effects resulting from his ac tivities and to relate these effects to particularized aspects of his character.  Siva&rsquo;s effects on the world are pervasive and multifarious, and we posit a  differentiated Siva composed of many parts to account for these. Hyposta tizing his activities, we may speak of the &ldquo;powers&rdquo; he uses to act and to  know, the &ldquo;faces&rdquo; with which he carries out the five fundamental activities,  the &ldquo;limbs&rdquo; whereby he acts upon the world.</p>
<p>We know Siva, then, through synecdoche and through partial approxima tion. Bhojadeva summarizes the two levels of Siva in this way: &ldquo;In an ulti mate sense, the entity we call Siva is one, inlaid with hundreds of various  powers. We postulate his divisions due to the diverse actions of his powers&rdquo;  (TP 33). Commenting on this passage, AghoraSiva elaborates: &ldquo;Due to the  diverse activities of Siva&rsquo;s powers, we postulate his divisions such as  SadaSiva and so on as a synecdoche, but this postulation (Mlpanika) is not  true in the highest sense (paramartha)&rdquo; (TPV 33). Humans are able to know  and act toward this secondary, particularized Siva precisely because names  and forms are applied to partial facets of a single integrated divinity. In this  way Siva is given a metaphorical &ldquo;body&rdquo; that we are able to meditate upon  and worship.</p>
<p>This epistemological division in our conceptualization of Siva&rsquo;s character  has no ultimate effect on Siva himself, of course. Siva&rsquo;s ontology encom passes both levels. The texts point out that Siva is not only both &ldquo;without  parts&rdquo; and &ldquo;with parts,&rdquo; but also &ldquo;both with and without parts&rdquo; (sakala nifkala). With Siva, there can be no contradiction between transcendence  and activity, nor between states of integration and differentiation. The dis tinction we make between two levels is only an apparent one (upadhi)·, it is  not fundamental. Siva surpasses these conceptual categories as well.</p>
<p>Siva&rsquo;s Multiple Forms</p>
<p>Philosophical texts may caution us that the secondary Siva &ldquo;with parts&rdquo; is  not the highest aspect of Siva. Nevertheless, since it is through this aspect</p>
<p>Summoning the Lord · IlS</p>
<p>that humans are able to comprehend Siva and act toward him, this secondary  level is of intense interest. The agamas, in fact, speak of several different  forms by which we are able to approach Siva.</p>
<p>The most comprehensive differentiated form of Siva is known as  SadaSiva, the &ldquo;Eternal Siva.&rdquo; SadaSiva is virtually identical with Siva&rsquo;s five  fundamental activities. Siva accomplishes his most far-reaching effects on  the cosmos, we have seen, through five activities: emission, protection, re</p>
<p>absorption, concealment, and grace. Yet it is not possible to act without a  &ldquo;body&rdquo; of some sort. Accordingly, even Siva must employ an instrument  (karana) to accomplish his purposes. For each fundamental activity, Siva  uses a corresponding mantra power: for emission the mantra is SADYOJATA,  for preservation it is VAMA, and so on. The five mantras through which  Siva carries out his most profound operations in the world, collectively  known as the five brahmamantras, constitute the five &ldquo;faces&rdquo; of Sadasiva.  Thus, SadaSiva represents Siva&rsquo;s most fundamental presence in the world,  the &ldquo;body of mantras&rdquo; with which Siva acts. &ldquo;As the soul comes and goes  by means of the body, so one must acknowledge that Siva comes and goes  through his body of mantras&rdquo; (KA 4.356). Or as Ramakantha succinctly puts  it, &ldquo;Siva does everything using SadaSiva as his body&rdquo; (KalAV 22.2-4).</p>
<p>The SadaSiva body is emphatically not a body like those of humans. It is  made of mantras or of powers, and it is completely without bondage, which  is the determining feature of human bodies. In Sarvadarsanasamgraha, Ma dhava admirably summarizes the conception of SadaSiva in his discussion of  Śaiva siddhanta philosophy:</p>
<p>The body of Parame§vara is not a common (prakrta) one, since the net of fetters—  mala, karman, and the others—is absent from it. Rather, it is a body of powers  (Sakta), since its heads and other parts are composed of the five mantras begin ning with KANA, which have the forms of §aktis. As is generally known, Siva has  KANA as his heads, TATPURUSA for faces, AGHORA as heart, VAMA for genitals, and  SADYOJATA as feet. And his body, which is not like our bodies, is the instrument  fashioned by his own will with which he performs the five fundamental activi ties: grace, veiling, reabsorption, maintenance, and emission, in that order. (SDS  7.57-63)6</p>
<p>As Madhava&rsquo;s description implies, it is not strictly accurate (though for us  it will be linguistically convenient) to refer to this body of powers as  &ldquo;SadaSiva&rsquo;s body,&rdquo; as if SadaSiva were a distinct being possessing a body.  Rather, the mantra-constituted body is SadaSiva, and it is an instrumental  part of the larger, encompassing Siva that Madhava refers to as the &ldquo;Highest  Lord&rdquo; ParameSvara.</p>
<p>Uncommon though it may be, this SadaSiva body is nevertheless accessi ble to humans; it can be visualized and worshiped. We can give specific  visual form to SadaSiva in meditation, impose this form onto some physical  support, and present offerings to it. As we will see, SadaSiva&rsquo;s body of</p>
<p>116 * ChapterFour</p>
<p>mantras, imposed onto the linga, serves as the embodiment that the highest,  inaccessible Siva comes to inhabit during daily worship. Sadasiva thereby  stands at the meeting point between ParamaSiva and his human worshipers  in Śaiva ritual.</p>
<p>While material representations of SadaSiva are comparatively rare in  Śaiva temples, he does have a form (or forms) that humans may perceive  through a process of visualization (bhavana).1 SadaSiva is most often por trayed as a single divinity with five-faces and ten arms.</p>
<p>One should meditate that SadaSiva has five faces, ten arms, and three eyes [in  each face]. Crystal in color and calm, he has a crescent moon as his crest, and his  hair is fastened with a snake. His seat is a lion-throne made of mantras, and he  sits atop a white lotus. Ornamented with bracelets, earrings, necklaces, the aus</p>
<p>picious thread, waistbands, upper-arm bracelets, golden bracelets, and chest bands, he is a lovely, tranquil, smiling sixteen-year-old. In his right hands he  holds trident, axe, sword, thundeibolt, and fire; the mudra of security and the  noose, along with the bell, snake, and hook, are in his five left hands. (KA  4.329-34)</p>
<p>Each of the five faces can be visualized individually, either as separate vis ages of a single body or as independent figures. In addition, each mantra  is associated with a portion of the body, arranged hierarchically: KANA is  located at the head, TATPURUSA at the mouth, and so on, as Madhava out lined.</p>
<p>Siva&rsquo;s capacities for action in the world are also instantiated in his six  &ldquo;limbs&rdquo; (anga), corresponding to the six aAgamantras. These limbs, like the  rays of the sun, are intrinsic extensions of Siva&rsquo;s being by which he accom plishes his aims.8</p>
<p>Just as fire and the sun are powerful because of their rays, Siva is likewise invin cible and all-performing because of his limbs, which arise from his inherent na ture (svabhava). The heart (HRD) is existence, and his head (SIRAS) is his lofty  preeminence. His topknot (SDCHA) is his autonomy. His armor (KAVACA) would  be his protective powers. His weapon (ASTRA) is the power by which he annihi lates. The eye (NETRA) is his power of omniscience, which illuminates every thing. Thus the six divine qualities of the creator of the world, Siva, are stated  here. (KA 4.362-65)</p>
<p>When the body of SadaSiva is visualized and constructed in ritual, these  limbs are superimposed onto it as additional enhancements of his being.  SadaSiva&rsquo;s powers are also specified by the panoply of &ldquo;weapons&rdquo;  (ayudha) he carries. According to one typical list, SadaSiva holds in his five  right hands the trident, axe, sword, thunderbolt, and fire, and in his left  hands he holds the snake, noose, bell, mudra of security, and hook (KA  4.332-33). However, Nirmalamani warns us, we should not imagine these</p>
<p>Summoning the Lord - 117</p>
<p>to be everyday weapons of violence. Rather, these are weapons of grace;  Siva uses them to destroy the bonds that ensnare the soul (KKDP pp. 100- 101). When visualizing SadaSiva, the worshiper meditates on them not sim ply as physical weapons, but in their inherent form of being (bhutasvarupa),  as aspects of Siva&rsquo;s power.9</p>
<p>His three-pronged trident is called the three qualities, and the axe is said to be  existence. The sword would be the radiance of his lordship. The thunderbolt is  his indivisibility. The fire is the power of reabsorption, which reduces fetters to  ashes and illuminates the tattvas which lie above mahamaya. Holding the snake  indicates his power to accomplish everything. His noose is the three fetters,  known as maya, karman, and mala. The bell represents undifferentiated sound  (tiada), denoting his mantra-body. The mudra of security is his power to protect  all creatures. His hook represents the rule by which the soul obtains the conse</p>
<p>quences resulting from previous actions. (KA 4.335-39)</p>
<p>SadaSiva is the form that, for Śaiva theologians, most closely approxi mates the totality of Siva&rsquo;s active presence in the world. His several super imposed layers of mantras and powers successively manifest portions of  Siva&rsquo;s presence: the five faces accomplish the five fundamental activi ties, the six limbs extend his capacities, and the ten weapons enable him to  grant grace. Ultimately, even SadaSiva is a synecdoche for Siva&rsquo;s complete  nature, but it is the most comprehensive such form accessible to human  powers.</p>
<p>SadaSiva is not the only form in which humans may perceive Siva. As  MaheSvara (the &ldquo;Great Lord&rdquo;), Siva takes on many aspects or embodiments  that are also manifest to humans. These aspects are distinct, individual  forms of Siva related to particular aspects of his being or to his specific  exploits in the world, and they are familiar to us through the iconic statu ary of Indian images and through the narrative descriptions of the puranas.10  The Rauravdgama, for instance, lists and describes thirteen typical forms  of MaheSvara: Sukhasana, SomeSa, Somaskanda, Vr§arQdha, Tripurari,  CandraSekhara, Kalahari, Kalyanasundara, Nrttamurti, Bhiksatana, Kankala,  Ardhanari, and Dak^inamQrti.11</p>
<p>Where SadaSiva is a comprehensive body of Siva, the forms of Mahe Svara are partial embodiments or aspects of Siva&rsquo;s character. Of Mahe Svara&rsquo;s multiple forms, some specialize in emission, others in preservation,  and still others in reabsorption. &ldquo;First Somaskanda, then Sukhasana, and  Kalyanasundara, CandraSekhara, Gangadhara—these five are called the &rsquo;emit ting embodiments&rsquo; (sr^timiirti). Vr§abhavahana, Ardhanari, Kirafa, VtreSa,  and finally Bhiksatana are the five forms called &lsquo;preserving embodi ments.&rsquo;&ldquo;12 Forms in which Siva carries out his more destructive activi ties, such as Tripurari and KiQaluiri, represent his &ldquo;reabsorptive embodi ment.&rdquo; Partial is always inferior to whole, so these individualized forms are</p>
<p>118 · Chapter Four</p>
<p>distinctly ancillary to SadaSiva. Forms of Mahesvara are not generally cen tral liturgical objects, but they do serve as iconic representations of Siva  within the scheme of any large Śaiva temple. A collectivity of these partial  aspects of Siva&rsquo;s totality, situated at appropriate places within the temple  complex, further specifies his comprehensive character and makes it acces sible to his devotee.</p>
<p>In addition to these particularized bodily forms by which Siva acts, he  also employs an energy or &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; (karcma) to accomplish his ends.  This instrument of unlimited efficacy is known as Sakti: &ldquo;By means of that  instrument which is Sakti, Siva becomes powerful (sdkta), that is, capable  of accomplishing the five fundamental activities so that the souls may  achieve worldly pleasures and liberation&rdquo; (TPV 3). Arising intrinsically  from Siva as heat arises from fire, Sakti is essentially one, undifferentiated  and without form. Like Siva, however, Sakti must perform many tasks in a  variegated creation, and to do so she assumes a plethora of appropriate  forms. When things are to be known (jneya), Siva&rsquo;s energy adopts the form  of JiianaSakti; when actions are to be undertaken (karya), it appears as  Kriyalakti. According to one common classification, Sakti has five princi pal, hierarchically ranked forms: ParaSakti, Adisakti, IcchaSakti, Jnana Sakti, and Kriyasakti. In accomplishing the five fundamental activities, the  five brahmamantras are said to have the &ldquo;form of Saktis.&rdquo; Another group of  eight Saktis act as the governors of the Vidyesvaras, divine agents of Siva.  The thirty-eight kalas, or &ldquo;portions&rdquo; of SadaSiva, are Saktis that differenti ate and constitute the active body of Siva&rsquo;s highest manifest form. These  forms of Sakti and other, still more differentiated Saktis are particularized  aspects of a unitary Energy that adapts itself with infinite flexibility to the  many circumstances of its activities.</p>
<p>This portrait of Siva&rsquo;s bodies and his powers still does not depict com pletely his active presence in the world, since Siva does not always carry out  his activities himself. He often acts through agents (adhikariri), whom he  instigates (prerana) to act on his behalf, as an imperial king assigns lesser  kings to perform the functions of sovereignty in smaller, encompassed por tions of the kingdom. These subordinate lords enact Siva&rsquo;s universal lord ship in specific domains or parts of the world.</p>
<p>Siva&rsquo;s agents are separate beings, not aspects of Siva. They are distinct  souls whose fetters are almost completely removed, and whose powers of  knowledge and action have been activated or enhanced by their proximity to  liberation, enabling them to cany out the assignment (adhikdra) given them  by Siva. Most powerful among them are the eight Vidyesvaras. These  &ldquo;lords of lords of kings of kings,&rdquo; as Mrgendragama calls them, and particu larly their leader, Ananta, act as Siva&rsquo;s agents over the entire impure do</p>
<p>main. &ldquo;In the pure domain, Siva is called creator; in the impure, Ananta is  the Lord&rdquo; (KirA vidya 3.27). Each VidyeSvara is presided over or governed  (adhisthita) by one of Siva&rsquo;s eight Saktis. The VidyeSvaras in turn rule over</p>
<p>Summoning the Lord · 119</p>
<p>a variety of subordinate lords—MandaIeSvaras, MantreSvaras, Bhuvane svaras, World Guardians, and so on—who exercise sovereignty in more re stricted domains. One group of MandaleSvaras particularly important in ritual  is the group of five KaraneSvaras: Brahman, Vi§nu, Rudra, Mahelvara, and  SadaSiva. These lords govern the domains of the five kalas and appear wher ever the kalas are. diva&rsquo;s lordship is thus differentiated as it extends into  particularized parts of the world.</p>
<p>Siva&rsquo;s Special Presence</p>
<p>The specific purpose of invocation is to summon Siva to enter into a partic ular form for the duration of the ritual so that the worshiper may offer his  services. The analogy used most frequently in the dgamas to conceptualize  this process is that of a soul entering a human body. Siva, like the soul, is  essentially consciousness (cit), while the linga, like the body, is composed of  inanimate substance (jada). When properly invoked, Siva enters into the</p>
<p>transformed linga as a soul penetrates a newly born human body.  Yet this very notion of entrance, implying that Siva might have previ ously been absent, raises a philosophical objection. It seems to contradict  Siva&rsquo;s pervasiveness. As the sages ask Siva in K&amp;mikSgama, &ldquo;How is it, O  Lord, that one can invoke Siva who is omnipresent? If one acknowledges  invocation, this would contradict his omnipresence&rdquo; (KA 4.354). Is Siva not  already in the object into which he is summoned? If not, then he would not  be pervasive. But if he is already present, what is the point of invoking him?  How can Siva enter into an object when he is already there?  To solve this apparent dilemma, the dgamas distinguish two degrees of  Siva&rsquo;s presence. Siva is indeed present everywhere, but in some places he  is more present than in others. Invocation is a rite that enhances or manifests  (abhivyakti) Siva&rsquo;s presence in some particular location. It establishes a spe cial or &ldquo;marked&rdquo; presence (yiiifta samnidhana) of Siva, or makes him &ldquo;evi dent&rdquo; (Svirbhdva) in a linga (MPAVkriya 3.26-29, AA 20.179). It persuades  Siva to &ldquo;face toward&rdquo; or to &ldquo;be favorable toward&rdquo; (abhimukha, sammukha)  the worshiper. Though Siva is already in the object, invocation in some  sense alters the scope or intensity of his presence.</p>
<p>To describe this alteration, many Śaiva siddhanta texts cite an analogy  comparing invocation to kindling fire in wood.</p>
<p>As fire, though present in a tree from its root to its tip, may become manifest in  one place, just so the manifestation of consciousness in one place does not con tradict its pervasiveness. Just as fire is made to arise in wood by rubbing it and  so on, Siva is manifested through the power of mantras and through devotion.  (KA 4.355, 352)</p>
<p>Fire pervades wood in a latent or potential form. Kindling a flame through  friction alters the character of the fire already present from latent to active,</p>
<p>120 · ChapterFour</p>
<p>from immanent to manifest. Invocation likewise activates or manifests Siva,  who is already present in the linga as he is present everywhere.  A second analogy, given by the monist author Appayadiksita, concerns  embers whose glow is obscured by a covering of ash. &ldquo;One may manifest a  heap of burning embers covered with ashes, even though the embers glow  by themselves&rdquo; (SAC p. 65). Similarly, invocation brings about a change in  the palpability of diva&rsquo;s presence. Blowing away ashes to reveal the burn ing embers does not alter the character of the fire itself. Rather, it makes  the embers evident. It discloses the presence of a fire that was previously  hidden. Invocation likewise reveals to the worshiper the presence of Siva  where before he had been inaccessible to the worshiper&rsquo;s perception.  Invocation, then, is understood as a rite that makes Siva&rsquo;s presence  within the ritual domain &ldquo;manifest&rdquo; in two senses of that word. It alters  the character of his presence from latent to active, and it changes the  worshiper&rsquo;s awareness of Siva&rsquo;s presence, disclosing what was previously  concealed.</p>
<p>Supportsfor Siva</p>
<p>Considering Siva&rsquo;s all-pervading presence and unlimited potentiality, it is  not surprising that he can manifest his special presence in many different  material forms: not just in icons, but also in pots, flowers, human bodies,  chalk diagrams, fire, and still other objects as well. Kamikagama provides  one list of possible supports for Siva in puja. In addition to various types of  linga, it advises,</p>
<p>A circular diagram, a painting on cloth, a sketch on a wall, a pedestal-shaped  stone consecrated by mantras, fire, water, guru, tree, and so on, a book on its  stand, in particular a naturally occurring linga-shaped stone or gem, a liftga formed  from sand or some such material, and other objects also are said to be suitable for  use as lingas. According to circumstances, one may prepare any of these individu</p>
<p>ally in order to worship Siva. (KA 4.270-72)</p>
<p>Similarly, in initiation Siva becomes present in five different supports. He  is simultaneously in the diagram on the central altar, in a full water-pot, in  the sacrificial fire, in the initiating guru, and finally he comes also to be  present in the initiate.13</p>
<p>Yet not all supports are equal. Some texts, for instance, distinguish be tween &ldquo;subtle&rdquo; (sQksma) lingas, which are internal, mentally constructed  forms, and tangible, &ldquo;gross&rdquo; (sthula) ones, which are external and substan tive, evincing a clear preference for the more subtle.</p>
<p>They say there are two types of lingas, exterior and interior. The exterior lifiga is  tangible, O excellent sages, while the interior one is subtle. Persons devoted to  external rituals and sacrifices, and those gratified by worshiping a tangible linga,</p>
<p>Summoning the Lord - 121</p>
<p>are themselves gross. The tangible form is only for those unable to visualize. The  inner linga is not perceptible to the dull-minded person who considers that exterior  reality is everything and that nothing else exists. The unstained, unchanging sub tle linga is just as evident to persons of knowledge, however, as a gross linga made  of some material like mud or wood is to those who are not practiced in yoga.  (.LPur 75.19-22)</p>
<p>Subtle is always best in the Śaiva siddhanta scheme of things. However,  such dismissive characterizations of gross worshipers, as we will see, fail to  take into account the careful yogic visualization and knowledge of Śaiva  theology necessary to transform even the most tangible linga into a ritually  suitable embodiment of Siva. Gross may become subtle, Siva-like, through  proper ritual action.14</p>
<p>The texts generally employ a threefold classification of the physical icons  most suitable for Siva&rsquo;s manifestation: undifferentiated (niskala), differenti ated (sakala), and mixed (sakalani$kala). &ldquo;That which is undifferentiated is  called the &rsquo;linga.&rsquo; That which is differentiated is termed &lsquo;image&rsquo; (bera). The  linga with faces (mukhalmga) is a mixture of the two and resembles the linga in  height and form&rdquo; (MM 33.1-2). An austere upright cylinder, the linga is  physically nonpartite.ls An image, by contrast, is an anthropomorphic form  with all the characteristic parts and marks of a body. Intermediate between  these two forms, the linga with faces is in its basic shape and dimensions a  linga, but with one or, more often, five faces partially emerging from the  central shaft in the four cardinal directions. The fifth, upward face is not  discernible to humans of limited visual acuity. The three categories of sup</p>
<p>ports are ranked according to the now-familiar criteria of emission and reab sorption, whereby the undifferentiated Mga is considered superior and the  fully partite image is inferior.</p>
<p>Moreover, the texts assert that these different types of icons parallel the  three levels or aspects of Siva&rsquo;s totality.16 The undifferentiated linga, appro priately, corresponds to Siva in his most encompassing, transcendent, and  undifferentiated aspect, Paramasiva. At the other end, the various human like images of Siva, depicting him iconographically as he has acted in the  world and appeared to his devotees, correspond to the level of embodiment  called MaheSvara. In between, where Siva is seen halfway between tran scendence and manifestation as it were, with five faces appearing from  the once-undifferentiated linga, the mukhalinga clearly parallels five-faced  SadaSiva.</p>
<p>Yet the question of accessibility once again arises. While the agamas cer tainly prefer the undifferentiated linga as the support for Siva par excellence,  and a Śaiva temple almost always contains a linga as its liturgical center,  Śaiva theology tells us that the ParamaSiva represented by the linga is beyond  human powers of knowing and acting. Conversely, while Śaiva puja ap pears to be particularly directed toward SadaSiva as the fullest form of Siva</p>
<p>122 · Chapter Four</p>
<p>niskala linga Paramasiva  mixed mukhalinga Sadasiva</p>
<p>sakala image Mahesvara  Fig. 8. Siva&rsquo;s supports</p>
<p>accessible to humans, it is quite rare to encounter a mukhalinga as a central  object of worship in a Śaiva temple.</p>
<p>This seeming disjuncture between theology and practice points us to a  central fact of puja as Śaiva siddhanta formulates it. The Śaiva worshiper  does not worship the object itself as Siva or as representing Siva; he directs  his worship toward it as the physical support for Siva&rsquo;s special presence.  And before any object can serve as proper support for Siva, it must be trans</p>
<p>formed into a suitably divine, Siva-like state.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the ritual work of summoning Siva into the linga requires  two main actions, the first constructive and the second more strictly invoca tory. First the worshiper must impose a series of mantras onto the linga and  its pedestal, reconstituting them in the process as a divine body seated atop  a divine throne. The undifferentiated linga is remade into Sadasiva, in effect.  Then and only then, the worshiper may approach Siva in his highest Pa</p>
<p>rama&amp;iva state, residing in the dvadasanta twelve inches above the wor shiper&rsquo;s crown, and summon him to enter into that ritually prepared em bodiment. Siva in his grace descends, infusing the accessible form of Sada siva with the animating energy of ParamaSiva, which normally lies beyond  our limited powers.</p>
<p>INVOCATION OF SIVA</p>
<p>After he has purified himself, the place of ritual, the substances to be of fered, and the mantras, the worshiper shifts his attention from the suitability  of the overall ritual environment to that of the linga, the receptacle of Siva&rsquo;s  presence during daily worship. He has now reached the point where he must  make ready to summon the Lord to the ritual domain.</p>
<p>Invoking Siva into the linga depends on considerable preparation. Prior to  its use in any Śaiva ritual, the linga must have been subjected to a detailed</p>
<p>Summoning the Lord - 123</p>
<p>ritual &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; (pratiftha) that activates it as a fit support for the divin ity.17 A proper stone is located and carefully examined, worked into the  appropriate form, and ritually infused with the being of Siva. A sequence of  eighteen distinct rites is required for the complete establishment of a linga.  This elaborate procedure transmutes the physical, fabricated object into an  icon worthy of receiving diva&rsquo;s presence, much as initiation enables the  initiate to offer worship directly to Siva. Only after this establishment has  been performed may the linga be used in worship. It must thereafter be phys</p>
<p>ically purified during each ritual performance, to remove any impurities that  may have infected it since the preceding ritual.</p>
<p>Yet establishment and purification of a linga are not sufficient in them selves. Before Siva may be summoned, both the linga and its pedestal must  be ritually transformed. During each performance of daily worship, the  worshiper superimposes a &ldquo;construction&rdquo; (kalpana.) of visualizations and  mantras onto the stone icon. Over the pedestal is imposed a &ldquo;divine throne&rdquo;  (divyasana), and the linga is infused with a &ldquo;divine body&rdquo; (divyadeha) com posed of mantras. These superimposed constructions enhance and perfect  the physical forms of pedestal and linga, transfiguring them into divine ones.</p>
<p>In fashioning these divine forms, the worshiper articulates through his  actions a highly concentrated, differentiated, organized theophany of Siva.  Together the divine throne and the body of mantras embody the entire man ifest cosmos and the multiple aspects through which Siva pervades and ani mates it, compressed as it were onto the physical substratum of pedestal and  linga.</p>
<p>A ritually constructed body encompassing within its parts the entire dif ferentiated cosmos, of course, hearkens back in India to the Vedic Puru§a,  the cosmic Being whose primordial dismemberment in sacrifice emanated  all the multifarious phenomena of the world. Śaiva puranas repeatedly assert  that Siva is that Purusa, that he has usurped—or rather, has always held—the  totalizing role that the Vedic texts claim variously for Purusa, Prajapati, and  Brahman. It is no accident, therefore, that this Puru§a is ritually put back  together again, daily, in Śaiva p«/a.18 Only such a comprehensive, divine  form can serve as the appropriate support of Siva&rsquo;s special presence during  daily worship.</p>
<p>The Divine Throne</p>
<p>Siva&rsquo;s divine throne is composed of five individual stages. To construct the  throne, the worshiper begins by visualizing, in ascending order, each of  these stages. Distributed hierarchically among the throne stages are the  thirty-one tattvas of the impure domain (aSuddhadhvan), from Earth up to  mdyd, as well as suddhavidya, the lowest constituent of the pure domain.19  The throne also includes within it other divisions of being: the five kalas,124 * Chapter Four</p>
<p>the multiple worlds (bhuvanas), the letters of the alphabet, and so on.20 The  divine throne, much like the ritualist&rsquo;s body in the rites of initiation and  atmaiuddhi, is a condensed ritual instantiation of the manifest cosmos and  all its constituents.</p>
<p>Each stage of the throne has one or more inhabiting powers who act as  presiding lords of that stage and all the constituent realities arrayed there.  The worshiper visualizes the form of each divinity and then imposes it onto  the pedestal, using that lord&rsquo;s proper mantra. Through this sequence of visu</p>
<p>alizations and impositions of mantras, the pedestal is systematically trans formed into a much more comprehensive divine throne fit for the Lord of All  Creation.</p>
<p>The worshiper himself ascends toward Siva as he prepares the divine  throne. Before he can honor Siva directly, he must first worship the differ entiated aspects of diva&rsquo;s power, the forms through which Siva acts upon  our cosmos. Following the order of reabsorption, which is always the route  to approach Siva, the ritualist passes through all levels of manifest reality  and does homage along the way to all manifestations of Siva&rsquo;s sovereignty.  As each upward stage of the divine throne is constructed, the worshiper  reaches closer to the place where the highest Lord can be summoned.</p>
<p>The worshiper begins the construction of the divine throne at the floor  stone that supports the pedestal. The throne rests on a &ldquo;tortoise stone&rdquo; base,  and Adharasakti (the &ldquo;Supporting Sakti&rdquo;) is visualized there, &ldquo;spotless as a  moonbeam, gentle, with four faces and four arms, resembling the milk ocean&rdquo; (KA 4.292).21 Atop the tortoise stone sits the throne of Ananta  (anantasana), the first stage of the divine throne. The worshiper should here  imagine- the VidyeSvara Ananta: &ldquo;indigo-colored, crowned with many  hoods, with one face and four arms, hands respectfully folded at his chest,  like a lotus arising from the milk-ocean&rdquo; (KA 4.293-94).22</p>
<p>The next stage is the square lion throne (simhasana), with handsome leo nine forms stationed at each of its four corners. These lions embody the four  lordly powers of Ananta: dharma, jnana, vairagya (equanimity), and ai Svarya (dominion). The worshiper invokes each royal power onto the cor responding corner of the throne with its mantra. Also located on the lion  throne in the cardinal directions are four more lions, which represent the  contraries of these powers, adharma, ajnana, avairagya, and anaisvarya.</p>
<p>The yoga throne (yogasana) surrounds the lion throne. This stage is fre quently omitted, however, and instead two coverings (chadana) are placed  atop the lion throne, at the boundary between pedestal and liiiga. Not coinci dentally, the coverings also serve to separate the impure and pure domains.  According to Kamikagama, these coverings are themselves Saktis, whose  purpose is to bind, liberate, and so on.</p>
<p>Above the two coverings at the very base of the linga, the worshiper con structs the lotus throne (padmasana), imagined as a horizontally unfolded</p>
<p>Summoning the Lord - 125</p>
<p>lotus of eight petals. The petals, AghoraSiva tells us, are the eight Vidye Svaras, and the eight Saktis that govern the VidyeSvaras are situated atop the  petals in circumambulatory order.23 &ldquo;They are brilliant as the rising sun,  with three eyes, four arms, and crowns of twisted locks adorned with the  crescent moon. With their lotus-hands they hold yak-tail fans, display the  mudras of granting boons and security, and cling to Siva&rdquo; (KKD p. 89). The  Sakti Vama presides over Ananta on the eastern petal, the Sakti Jye§{ha pre</p>
<p>sides over Siiksma in the southeast, and so on. Various other constituent  realities may also be imposed onto the petals: the eight yogic powers, the  five elements and three qualities. In the center of the lotus sits Manonmam,  the undifferentiated Sakti of SadaSiva.</p>
<p>The fifth stage, the stainless throne (vimalasana), is superimposed atop  the lotus throne. The worshiper visualizes three concentric mandalas: the sun  mandala on the tips of the petals, the moon mandala on the stamen tips, and the  fire manda/aontheperimeterofthepericarp.ThesemaniiaZasareidentified with  the three categories of impure tattvas: atman, vidya, and Siva.24 He invokes  onto these mandalas their respective presiding deities, the Karane Svaras Brahman, Vi§nu, and Rudra. Again, the worshiper may also impose  onto the three mandalas other groups of three, such as the three qualities, the  three sacrificial fires, and the three Saktis Jnana, Kriya, and Iccha. Finally,  the worshiper imposes Sakti in her highest form in the middle of the stain</p>
<p>less throne, completing the construction of the divine throne. &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; says  Kamikdgama, &ldquo;ParamaSiva&rsquo;s throne begins with Sakti and ends with Sakti&rdquo;  (4.313).</p>

<p>The divine throne, encompassing all constituents of the impure cosmos, be comes in this way suffused with the powers and agents through which Siva  exercises his sovereignty. The throne that supports him in ritual is imbued  with all the energies that support and enact his presence in the world.23</p>
<p>Body of Mantras</p>
<p>Only when the divine throne has been fashioned may a divine form sit upon  it. As he has transformed the pedestal, the worshiper now superimposes  onto the lihga a divine body, the body of mantras that is in fact SadaSiva, the  most complete form of Siva humans are able to comprehend and worship.</p>
<p>126 · Chapter Four</p>
<p>This body occupies the tattvas of the pure domain (Suddhadhvan), just as  Siva carries out his activities directly in that portion of the cosmos.  The divine body is composed of mantras, unlike the impure, fettered bod ies of humans. It does, however, mirror the divine body that the worshiper  has already imposed onto himself in atmasuddhi. Exactly the same mantras  transform the ritualist&rsquo;s body as enhance the linga. &ldquo;He should impose man tras on the deity just as he has imposed them onto his own body,&rdquo; directs  Kamikagama (4.349). The resulting bodily parallelism of ritualist and Siva  reinforces the state of relative equality that the two come to share during  worship.</p>
<p>The worshiper begins by visualizing SadaSiva.26 &ldquo;When he has thus con structed Siva&rsquo;s throne, the priest with firm mind and restrained faculties  should fill his cupped hands with flowers, and visualize an embodiment&rdquo;  (AA 20.158). Following meditation verses like the ones I quoted earlier to  describe SadaSiva, the worshiper imaginatively puts together, portion by  portion, a complete portrait of SadaSiva. He visualizes in order each of the  five faces, ten weapons, and so on, then consolidates these parts into a uni fied image. He next transports the visualization into the linga. &ldquo;When he has  visualized the embodiment, the worshiper should then invoke it onto that  previously described throne of Siva, using the flowers in his cupped hands  and the MORTI mantra&rdquo; (AA 20.164-65). The visualization is first transferred  into the flowers, which are then scattered atop the linga. The constructed  embodiment flows from the flowers downward into the linga. Simultaneously  reciting the mantra of embodiment, MORTI, the worshiper invokes into the  linga the full form that he has mentally constructed. The visualization infuses  the Mga, supplanting it in the mind of the worshiper. &ldquo;He removes [the phys ical form of] the linga from his imagination, since the shape of the linga inter feres [with his visualization of Sadasiva]&rdquo; (KKD p. 99). The physical linga</p>
<p>has been transformed into the visualized form of Sadasiva.  The worshiper now imposes the five mantras of SadaSiva onto their  proper locations. On each section of the linga, now viewed as the body of  SadaSiva, he places one of the brahmamantras: KANA on the head,  TATPURU$A on the face, and so on in descending order. (See the photographs  of brahmamantranyasa onto the linga, Plate 5.) He next places the thirty eight kalamantras, which further articulate the body of Sadasiva. According  to some texts, he then imposes still more mantras: the angamantras, the man tras of the alphabet, VYOMAVYAPIN, and so on. Whatever mantras have been  placed on the ritualist&rsquo;s body in atmasuddhi should also be used here. Fi nally, the body of Sadaiiva is fully imbued with the powers of mantras, and  the worshiper imposes the VIDYADEHA mantra, the mantra that unifies and  completes this variegated construct.27</p>
<p>The body of SadaSiva, according to Kamikagama and Kriyakramadyo tika, is made up of two aspects, much as a human body is composed of both</p>
<p>Summoning the Lord · 127</p>
<p>a subtle and a gross body. These two must be invoked separately into the  linga. First the worshiper visualizes the &ldquo;subtle embodiment&rdquo; (siiksmamurti):  &ldquo;an embodiment shaped like a staff of emanating energy (tejas), not divided  into parts, pervading the highest bindu which is identical with the siva</p>
<p>tattva&rdquo; (KKD p. 95). Next the worshiper visualizes and invokes the body  of mantras known as vidyadeha (literally, &ldquo;knowledge-body&rdquo;), the super anthropomorphic body of SadaSiva with five faces and ten arms. &ldquo;In the  middle of this embodiment, at the top of the ^iva-Iinga, the priest should  impose the vidyadeha that is SadaSiva. This Lord made of pure knowledge  is endowed with the thirty-eight kalas, and has a body formed from the  brahmamantras and the angamantras&rdquo; (KA 4.326-27). These two aspects of  SadaSiva&rsquo;s embodiment represent two dimensions of diva&rsquo;s active presence.  The subtle embodiment corresponds to diva&rsquo;s undirected potentiality, the  vidyadeha to his active engagement in the world.</p>
<p>Throughout the construction of diva&rsquo;s divine body, the worshiper follows  the order of emission. He invokes first the undifferentiated subtle embodi ment, then the differentiated vidyadeha. In constructing the vidyadeha, he  begins with ISANA and ends with SADYOJATA, following a descending path.  After placing the five brahmamantras, he imposes the still more differenti ated kaldmantras, again proceeding from the head down. As indicated ear lier, emission is the general order for rites of construction, since ritual con struction is a form of emission.</p>
<p>The preparation of linga and pedestal for diva&rsquo;s presence reconstitutes  them as divine forms, which together substantiate an entire cosmos, concen trated within their physical support. Figure 9 summarizes the complex set of  impositions that brings this about. First, all tattvas that make up the mani fest world are distributed between the body and the throne.

<p>domains. Onto the divine throne, composed of the impure tattvas, the wor shiper invokes the multiple Saktis and agents that govern the lower domain.  The divine body is that of SadS£iva, the body of mantras with which Siva  acts directly in the pure domain.</p>
<p>Ascent of the Mantra</p>
<p>Complete as they are, the divine body and throne remain inanimate until  Siva himself enters. The central ritual act of invocation remains: to lead  Siva into form. Siva in his highest aspect as animating consciousness must  be summoned to inhabit and enliven his divine body.</p>
<p>The divine body is a highly differentiated embodiment of Siva&rsquo;s active  powers. Yet in his highest state, Siva is undifferentiated. To enter into this  constructed form, Siva must be led from his undifferentiated realm into a  particularized body.</p>
<p>When he has constructed this body of powers, the worshiper should make undif ferentiated Siva—the highest cause of this world, constant, eternal, consisting in  knowledge, joy, and pleasure, pervading every tattva, immeasurable and incom parable, free from signifier and signified, whose domain surpasses our powers of</p>
<p>speech and cognition—specially manifest in a differentiated form, compelling  him there with the SIVA mantra accompanied by the mudras of invocation and so  on. (KA 4.349-51)</p>
<p>Siva descends from his formless state in the dvadasanta into the differenti ated body superimposed onto the linga. It is a passage by which unknowable,  unworshipable Paramasiva unites with and infuses the more accessible  SadaSiva.</p>
<p>To effect this passage requires two converse ritual movements: an ascent  by the worshiper to approach Siva, and a descent of Siva into the linga. First,  the worshiper recites Siva&rsquo;s own mantra, rising from his own miilMMra up  to the dvadaSanta. As he recites, the worshiper gradually reunifies the man</p>
<p>tra and finally merges it into ParamaSiva. This first movement follows the  order of reabsorption traversing the worshiper&rsquo;s body: simultaneously as cending along the central breath channel, reintegrating the differentiated  mantra, and approaching Siva. Second, the worshiper leads Siva together  with the mantra from the dvddasanta back into the worshiper&rsquo;s body, and  from there into the linga. This follows the order of emission. Siva descends  from the dvadaHdnta into the linga and at the same time passes from an undif</p>
<p>ferentiated state into a manifest form.</p>
<p>The central mediator in all Śaiva invocations is the mantra. Mantras are  effective for summoning divinities, the texts tell us, because of the inherent  connection of signified (vacya) and signifier (vacaka). A mantra is a signi fier, and the divinity to which it refers is its signified. The two are part of the</p>
<p>Summoning the Lord - 129</p>
<p>same reality; the mantra is often called the &ldquo;form&rdquo; or the sonant aspect of the  divinity that it signifies. Thus, reciting the mantra of a divinity can automat ically render that divinity present.</p>
<p>When invoking Siva, the worshiper recites the MOLA (&ldquo;root&rdquo;) mantra, &ldquo;Om  haum, I bow to Siva.&rdquo; Also referred to as SIVA and PRASADA (&ldquo;lofty&rdquo;), this  mantra signifies Siva in his totality.28 For that reason it is the most important  and most powerful of all mantras.</p>
<p>The worshiper employs the technique called &ldquo;ascending pronunciation&rdquo;  (ιuccarana) when reciting the ΜOLA mantra. The term uccarana generally  means &ldquo;to raise up&rdquo; and &ldquo;to pronounce&rdquo;; its specialized usage here combines  both meanings. This method of pronouncing mantras is used at various  points throughout this and other Śaiva rituals, always to reintegrate differen</p>
<p>tiated unities or to transport things to a higher level of being. In previous  chapters we have seen ascending pronunciation utilized to protect the soul  during atmasuddhi by transporting it upward to the dvadaSanta, and to  merge temporarily the soul of the initiate with ParamaSiva at the conclusion  of nirvanadtksa. It is used also to purify the mantras and to invoke Siva onto  the hands and body during self-purification. According to Appayadlkgita, the  worshiper employs it as well with each offering he makes in daily worship,  as will be discussed in the next chapter. In invocation, ascending pronun ciation enables the ritualist to reunify the mantra within his own body and  finally to merge the reintegrated mantra into the deity that it signifies,  ParamaSiva.</p>
<p>Initially the MOLA mantra is spread out in twelve or sixteen &ldquo;portions&rdquo;  (kolas again) throughout the worshiper&rsquo;s body, distributed along the vertical  axis formed by the central breath channel, and divided by its nodes. Each  mantra portion has a name and a physical form or mark. Each extends a  particular length in the body, has a characteristic color for purposes of visu alization, and is presided over by one of the KaraneSvaras.29 The first mantra  portion, medhd, for instance, extends in the worshiper&rsquo;s body a distance of  twelve fingers between his navel and his heart. It consists in the sound A or  Au of the syllable HAUM (which is the seed-syllable of MOLA) and is the  color of a flaming fire. It is ruled by the lord Brahman. The next mantra  portion, rasa, situated between the heart and the throat, eight fingers in  extent, consists in the sound υ and is governed by Vi§pu. The portions of  the mantra reach all the way up to the dvadasanta, twelve fingers above the  worshiper&rsquo;s head, where ParamaSiva resides. Figure 10 summarizes the  twelve-λαάζ arrangement of the mantra.</p>
<p>Once again, all constituent tattvas of the manifest cosmos are contained  within this differentiated unity, distributed among the mantra portions. As  usual, they are vertically arranged in hierarchical order. All tattvas of the  impure domain are situated in the three lowest portions, corresponding to  the audible portions of the mantra. The five higher tattvas of the pure do-</p>
<p>Fig. 11. Locations of the twelve kalas</p>
<p>Summoning the Lord * 131</p>
<p>main are located in subtler, inaudible mantra portions. According to An antaSambhu, the live kaliis are also contained within the parts of the mantra.  To perform the ascending pronunciation, the worshiper prepares himself  physically and mentally.</p>
<p>He first makes his body firmly upright and restrains his mind and senses, request ing, &ldquo;I wish to honor with mantras the Lord Isvara, who is immeasurable, !inde finable, without equal, without pain, subtle, ubiquitous, eternal, unchangeable,  and imperishable.&rdquo; He fills his body with wind via the Ufa and retains it. He places  his flower-filled hands in anjali at the level of his heart, firmly forming the mudrS  of invocation. (SAC p. 61)</p>
<p>Then he begins to recite the seed-syllable of the mantra. He draws out the  initial H sound of HAUM from his mul&amp;dhara and begins very gradually to  enunciate the portions of the mantra. At the navel, the sound H is united  with the sound A of the medha portion. At the heart, this HA is united into  the υ of rasa. At the throat, the sound M is added. Thus all the audible  sound components of the HAUM seed-syllable are reunited. As the mantra  continues upward, still other subtler, inaudible portions of the mantra are  reintegrated. Stage by stage, the portions of the differentiated mantra are  reabsorbed into their more fundamental unity.</p>
<p>This ascending movement of reabsorption occurs simultaneously in sev eral dimensions. As the worshiper pronounces the mantra, he directs his  breath upward along the su$umna, dismissing in order the KaraneSvaras along  the way. He moves his hands filled with flowers upward, an outward corre late to the inward motion of the breath. He visualizes each mantra portion  as well: medha is the color of a flame of fire, rasa is like the sun and moon,  and so on. While joining together the portions of the mantra, then, the wor shiper must also unify his actions. Voice, breath, hand gesture, and mental  visualization ascend together. If worship overall requires &ldquo;the activities of  mind, speech, and body,&rdquo; as Suryabhatta tells us (&amp;SPbh p. 37), invocation  is a rite in which the ritualist must direct all these activities concurrently in  a single direction and toward a single end. (See photograph sequence on  avahana, Plate 6.)30</p>
<p>The target of these ascending movements is the dvadaianta, the point of  reabsorption (Iaya). ParamaSiva resides there, twelve inches above the ritu alist&rsquo;s body as he is also beyond all limitations of form. When the ascending  pronunciation reaches the άνάάαέάηία, the fully reintegrated mantra is ab</p>
<p>sorbed into ParamaSiva. The worshiper visualizes Paramasiva becoming  united with the mantra that signifies him. Just as the differentiated portions  of the mantra have been reabsorbed into a unity through ascending pronun ciation, here the mantra itself is reunited with its referent. The fundamental  unity of signifier and signified, mantra and divinity, is restored.</p>
<p>132 * Chapter Four</p>
<p>With the union of mantra and Siva, the ascending phase of invocation is  completed. The worshiper has used the MOLA mantra to approach Siva at the  highest level. Pronouncing the mantra upward, he has reunified the differen tiated portions of the mantra and then merged it into ParamaSiva. At the  same time he has fused all his own activities—of mind, speech, and body—  and directed them along the same path of reabsorption. The whole process,  requiring just a single long breath to perform, is itself a compressed meta</p>
<p>phor of reintegration.</p>
<p>Siva&rsquo;s Descent into Form</p>
<p>When Siva and his mantra are reunited, the worshiper next leads Siva into  the form that has been constructed for him. As Narayanakantha puts it, &ldquo;One  should convey Siva from the dvadaidnta, the place where the sound arising  from the ascending pronunciation of the mantra ceases, into the embodi ment according to the order of emission&rdquo; (MrAV kriya 3.12). The worshiper  escorts Siva by means of the mantra.</p>
<p>Siva&rsquo;s descent begins with the worshiper meditating on Paramaliva. &ldquo;He  imagines Paramaliva: all-accomplishing, undifferentiated, omnipresent,  composed of knowledge and joy, intrinsically radiant&rdquo; (KKD p. 101). Vis ual imaging of the deity is not possible at this level since ParamaSiva tran scends form; rather, the ritualist can only call to mind the unlimited qualities  of Siva in his highest state.</p>
<p>Identifying the mantra and Siva, the worshiper leads Siva downward from  the dvadaianta to the forehead, reversing direction along the same path that  the mantra has just ascended. Once again he meditates on Siva, but now in  a more visual form, that of an exceedingly radiant orb. AghoraSiva tells us  that &ldquo;Siva there resembles a crore of suns, whitening every direction with  pieces of nectar that issue forth&rdquo; (KKD p. 102). Appayadlksita describes him  at this point as &ldquo;a thousand flowing moons&rdquo; (SAC p. 62). Midway between  the dvadaianta and the linga, Siva is neither fully niskala nor fully sakala.  He has a visual form that contrasts him with the formless Paramaliva. Yet  the form is a single, undifferentiated glowing circle, not the highly differen tiated bodily form of Sada&amp;va.</p>
<p>The worshiper next lowers his hands to the level of his heart and exhales.  Siva passes from the forehead along the breath channel and out of the wor shiper&rsquo;s body through the right nostril. He enters into the flowers held in the  worshiper&rsquo;s hands. Reciting the HRD mantra, the worshiper places the flowers  atop the linga, and Siva enters into the divine body constructed for him, de scending from the brahmarandhra of the embodiment to its heart. Siva is  now embodied as SadaSiva, in a differentiated divine body comprised of  mantras, yet infused too with the presence of Paramasiva.</p>
<p>Summoning the Lord · 133</p>
<p>Once Siva is fully present in the linga, the worshiper immediately acts to  keep him there. &ldquo;He establishes him with the mudra of establishment,  makes him present with the mudra of presence, and restrains him with the  mudra of restraint He declares, &lsquo;Welcome to you, O Great God.&rsquo; And he  imagines the reply of the lord, &lsquo;Greetings, my child&rsquo;&rdquo; {KKD pp. 103-4).  The worshiper then humbly requests that Siva stay: &quot; Ό Lord, protector of  all the worlds, please remain present in this linga until worship is completed,  out of your love (sampriti)&rsquo;&rdquo; (KKD p. 104). Even after the elaborate invoca tory work he has performed, the Śaiva worshiper still regards Siva&rsquo;s pres</p>
<p>ence in the linga not as a matter of ritual compulsion, but as a manifestation  of benevolent disposition, of Siva&rsquo;s &ldquo;love.&rdquo; He then offers Siva the ritually  prepared arghya water of hospitality, the first of many services he will per form for the manifest Lord before him</p>
<p>Siva&rsquo;s Two Levels Reunited</p>
<p>The particular task of invocation, we have seen, is to bring Siva, who is  described theologically as formless and without limit, into a limited form  through which the ritualist may worship him. This descent of Siva is possi ble because Siva has more than one level of being. In his highest state, Siva  is inaccessible to human powers. But Siva has a secondary level, through  which he engages in activities and by which he comes within the range of  our knowledge and action. Sadagiva, Siva&rsquo;s body of mantras, is the most  comprehensive form of Siva at this secondary level.</p>
<p>The rite of invocation treats these two aspects of Siva&rsquo;s being as onto logically separate entities, then reunifies them within the linga. The first set  of ritual actions transforms the linga and pedestal, the physical supports  of Siva&rsquo;s presence, into divine forms appropriate to Siva. The worshiper  superimposes onto the linga a differentiated body of mantras, the precise  form of SadaSiva. This complete embodiment of Siva&rsquo;s secondary level  serves as the form or body that Siva will inhabit during worship. The second  set of rites summons Siva to enter into this form. The worshiper uses the  MOLA mantra, reintegrated and finally merged into Parama&amp;va, to lead Siva  from his highest, undifferentiated state into the limited, particularized body  of mantras. Like a soul entering a body, Siva inhabits and animates the di</p>
<p>vine body of mantras that the ritualist has constructed for him.  From Siva&rsquo;s point of view, this entry into form entails an apparent dimin ishment. Siva descends from his undifferentiated, all-pervading, formless  ParamaSiva state into a differentiated, limited embodiment as SadaSiva. The  diminishment is only apparent, however, since any subtraction from infinity  leaves infinity as its remainder. And from the perspective of the human wor shiper, Siva&rsquo;s descent enhances his presence. From an immanent but un-134 · Chapter Four</p>
<p>knowable and unworshipable divinity, Siva becomes accessible to the wor shiper&rsquo;s powers of knowing and acting. It is this special presence of Siva in  the linga that makes possible all subsequent acts of worship. Siva is made  fully manifest, and the worshiper may now begin to offer his services of  devotion.</p>
<p>COMMON GROUND</p>
<p>Śaiva daily worship consists, at its core, in a series of transactions between  a human worshiper and the god Siva. Yet in the normal course of things,  such transactions appear nearly impossible. The distance between human  and god seems insuperable. The human worshiper is a soul encrusted with  fetters that seriously impede his power of knowing and acting, and the soul  is bound within an impure body that is a kind of congealment of its fetters.  Siva, by contrast, is in his highest state utterly transcendent. Formless, not  constrained by any of the limitations that affect humans, Siva is beyond all  human capacities of knowledge and action.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there exist ritual means to bridge this gap. In the two preced ing chapters, I have discussed the procedures through which Śaiva daily  worship reduces the difference in status between the worshiper and Siva,  thereby enabling them to engage in direct relations with one another. These  processes are, strictly speaking, merely necessary preparations for the rites  of homage that follow. Yet in another sense they are central to the ritual.  They articulate and enact fundamental metaphysical propositions of Śaiva  siddhanta, which organize the world of ritual as well as the world itself.</p>
<p>In daily worship, two converging processes of transformation bring the  worshiper and Siva from their very divergent initial states to meet on an  equivalent plane of being. The worshiper first transfigures his own body,  through the rite of atmasuddhi, into a body of mantras like that of Sadasiva.  In the process, he enacts the passage by which his soul &ldquo;becomes a Siva&rdquo; in  liberation. After transforming himself, the ritualist summons Siva to enter  the linga prepared for him. He first superimposes onto the linga a body of  mantras mirroring his own, and then he uses the MULA mantra to lead Siva  from his highest, transcendent state into this body. The formless, inaccessi ble ParamaSiva becomes embodied as Sadasiva, a form of Siva that can be  meditated on and worshiped.</p>
<p>These converging paths of transformation, as Figure 11 illustrates, corre spond to the orders of reabsorption and emission, respectively. The ritualist  moves from outside the temple into the central sanctum. As he does so, he  gradually attains a higher state of purity. In the rite of self-purification he  systematically reabsorbs all the impure constituents of his body into their  pure sources, a process that parallels the long-range passage of his soul  toward liberation through the gradual removal of fetters.

<p>movement of avahana</p>
<p>Siva, the worshiper again follows the path of reabsorption to approach Siva,  first in constructing the divine throne and then in the ascending pronuncia tion of the MOLA mantra. Siva, on the other hand, descends from the dvada Mnta into the linga according to the order of emission. In this descent, Siva</p>
<p>passes from the undifferentiated niskala state to a particularized sakala one,  from formlessness to embodiment, from completely subtle to relatively  gross.</p>
<p>Through these two procedures, the worshiper and Siva are able to en counter one another on common ground, in a temporary condition of rela tive equality. No mediator—animal, human, or divine—is necessary, since  the distance between the two parties has been ritually negated. In temple</p>
<p>worship performed on behalf of others, the priest capable of such self-trans formation acts as mediator for those who wish to make offerings to the Lord  but who are not able (because not initiated) to engage in direct transactions  with Siva. The worshiper who performs p&amp;ja on his own behalf meets with  and makes his offerings directly to Siva.</p>
<p>This pattern of daily worship, by which the worshiper and Siva follow  converging paths to meet on a common ritual plane, parallels the modified  dualistic metaphysics of Śaiva siddhanta and contrasts with both monist  schools such as Advaita Vedanta and more bhakti-onented dualist schools.  Ritual procedures do not negate the fundamental separateness of the wor shiper and Siva but do diminish the adventitious differences between them.</p>
<p>As we have seen, Śaivas presume an ontological separation between souls  and Siva, both before and after liberation. Even when the soul becomes an  autonomous Siva through moksa, it remains distinct from Siva. Similarly,</p>
<p>136 · Chapter Four</p>
<p>the ritual transformations of daily worship do not bring about any merging  or unification of worshiper and Siva, as monist worshipers suppose. Siva  and worshiper meet as separate beings in the domain of ritual.</p>
<p>We have seen as well that bound souls are distinguished from Siva by the  fetters that constrain them. The passage of a soul to liberation gradually  removes these fetters, and in so doing it effaces the differences between the  soul and Siva. In liberation, the soul becomes equal in power and purity to  Siva. The transformations of soul and Siva performed in daily worship sim</p>
<p>ilarly decrease the discrepancy that normally exists between the two. Puri fied Śaiva worshiper and embodied god approach one another as separate  but relatively equal, unlike in the bhakti schools that presume and extol an  eternal and unbridgeable hierarchy between the two. (Śaivas admit, how ever, that the condition of equality between soul and Siva can only be rela tive, never absolute, in ritual and in liberation.) The ritual transformations  effected through atmaSuddhi and invocation enable the soul and Siva to  meet face to face in worship as in liberation.</p>

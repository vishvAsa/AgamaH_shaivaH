## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

As an undergraduate at Bard College, it was encountering *The Alchemical Body*, and with it, the realization that there was space within the life of the mind where a scholar could spend a whole lifetime dwelling in possibility and making real discoveries that made me decide to pursue this as my vocation. It has been a great privilege to be David Gordon White’s student. It is his compassion and his insight that made completing the present work possible during often trying times. It was David who redirected my focus, encouraging me to hone my sociological imagination and center the transactional realities of everyday religious life in a manner that has transformed my scholarship. No one else in the Western academy would have not merely endured but copiously commented upon this much academic prose, sometimes sending it back to the kitchen when it failed to live up to his exacting standards. I am forever grateful. Thanks to Barbara Holdrege for her kindness and superb sense of structure and for making me master and distill her gargantuan reading list (over a hundred books, some of them a dozen volumes), particularly in regard to the Vaiṣṇava discourses on *bhakti rasa*, and to Vesna Wallace, above and beyond her erudition, for a being a marvelous human being who provided constant support.

I owe a profound debt of gratitude to the variety of guilds—for, what are academic organizations but the sort of *samūhas* we will encounter throughout this thesis operating without strong sovereignty—within which my own professional identity has been articulated and where, by osmosis and example, I have acquired my craft. Thanks are due to the AOS (American Oriental Society), especially the South Asia division, which I have been attending since 2007, where time and again I saw modelled a type of careful close reading married to rigorous historical thinking that I have
[[Pv]]
aspired to emulate throughout the present work. I have been a (small) part of the American Academy of Religion for even longer, since I was a junior in college, and to my great benefit, among many other virtues, it has granted me a master class in the art of effective and entertaining communication across scholarly disciplines.

Inspired by my enthusiasm, Jeffrey Lidke invited me in my junior year as an undergraduate to Flagstaff, AZ, to sit in on the conference of the Society for Tantric Studies. There, I was essentially adopted by this kind, brilliant, and wildly innovative community. So many of the ways I think about religion that are reflected in the pages below are the product of decades of learning from and eventually dialoguing with this extraordinary thought collective. My thanks to Loriliai Biernacki, Marcy Braverman, Gudrun Bühnemann, Helen Crovetto, Paul Donnelly, Gavin Flood, David Gray, Paul Hackett, István Keul, David Peter Lawrence, Jeff Lidke, John Nemec, Charles Orzech, Richard Payne, Jeff Ruff, Jim Sanford, Fred Smith, Sthaneshwar Timalsina, Aaron Ullrey, and Hugh Urban. A special thanks to Glen Hayes, for being my advocate from the very beginning. The other great thought collective that has fundamentally shaped my identity as a scholar is the American tradition of the academic study of Dharmaśāstra. My profound thanks to Patrick Olivelle, Don Davis, Tim Lubin, Mark McClish, and David Brick for including me in their approach to close reading, historical thinking, and fine-grained intertextual analysis; you have helped to shape someone who was a mere interloper into a dialogical partner. Thanks in particular to Don Davis for many years of support.

The time I spent in Pondicherry at the École française d’Extrême-Orient under the support of an AIIS research grant was one of the most intellectually fruitful and happiest times of my adult life. It was a privilege and a pleasure to study under Dominic Goodall, an incredibly
[[Pvi]]
gracious host, whose guidance profoundly improved my understanding of how to work with difficult and highly corrupt Aiśa texts, especially the *Śivadharmavivaraṇa* and *Piṅgalāmata*. Hugo David provided a master class in microtextual approaches to *śāstra* informed by the best of the European academy and Indian pandit traditions, greatly enriching my reading of the *Bhāgavata Purāṇa* and *Muktāphala/Kaivalyadīpikā*. It was equally inspiring to be a part of the “big table” at Pondicherry, participating to the best of my abilities in scholastic deliberation on matters of interpretation and emendation alongside such great minds as Anjaneya Sharma, S. A. S. Sharma, Csaba Desző, Suganya Anandakichenin, Charles Lee, Jason Birch, Jim Mallinson, and Akane Saito. Thanks to the Haṭha Yoga Project for including me in their workshop at the end of my tenure at Pondicherry, as well as to Viswanatha Gupta for manuscript work and transcription. Profound thanks to Shaman Hatley for his kindness over the years and for sharing manuscript material for the study of the *Piṅgalāmata*. As always, thanks to Prerana Patel for making the EFEO what it is and doing everything in her power to enable us to navigate the uncharted and frequently mercurial waters of Indian bureaucracy. Many thanks to Elise Auerbach of the AIIS for her patient support and advocacy, especially when the VISA granting offices and banking facilities were being difficult and to Purnima Mehta, Philip Lutgendorf, and the staff at AIIS in Delhi for facilitating logistics and hosting us fellows.

A major objective of my time in India was to work through key parts of the archive that are foundational to chapter 4 of the present study under a traditional scholar of old Kannada. Finding one who had the time and inclination, and was capable of this task, even after a search across multiple universities, proved an impossible endeavor. My salvation came in the form of the extraordinary and unduly underappreciated Tim Lorndale, with his unique facility in both philology and pedagogy, who was willing to puzzle through the sort of non-
[[Pvii]]
standard discourse to which pandits are often averse. Ironically, I came to India and ended up staying up at odd hours of the night to read with a *videśī* teacher in Pennsylvania. Together we puzzled through these two extraordinarily difficult texts, and whatever literary quality and precision have emerged are mostly due to his contributions.

As much as Tim Lorndale transformed my understanding of the world of literary Kannada transmuted into the “vernacular,” my understanding of the literary and cultural landscape of the western Deccan has been utterly transformed by my friendship with two remarkable people, Saili Palande-Datar and Amol Bankar, both of whom I initially forged a connection with through the usually not so wonderful world of social media. Apart from many hours of conversation, Saili and I spent two magical weeks on the road, documenting at a grueling pace sites both familiar and obscure in search of recovering an early medieval Maharashtrian imaginary and its dialogical continuation with a myriad of undocumented early modern and contemporary “present moments.” Through Saili, I learned to see every site through almost completely new eyes, and was able to participate as a fly on the wall in the type of deep community engagement across the boundaries of caste and religion that she so effortlessly fosters in every space through which her dynamic presence passes. Thank you for helping me encounter so many extraordinary people whose company I otherwise would never have kept. Like Saili herself, the independent scholar, epigrapher, and numismatician Amol Bankar began as a disciple of one of the last great traditional scholars of old Marathi, Brahmanand Deshpande, continuing his legacy for careful philology in the vernacular. Dialoging with him, travelling together, and working through inscriptions as well as particularly tricky portions of the *Vivekasindhu* has been a joy and I have benefited immensely from his tutelage.

[[Pviii]]
Thanks to the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute for letting me browse their unpublished Dharmaśāstra to my heart’s content, and to Dr. Dash and his successors at the New Catalogus Catalogorum Project for providing me access to the raw data that went into the compilation of the catalogues, much of which has yet to be incorporated into the published editions. A sincere thanks to the staff and directors at the GOML in Chennai and the ORI in Mysore, at the ORI in Karyavattom, Kerala, especially P. L. Shaji for hospitality and for helping me to begin to master Malayalam paleography, particularly the unusual script in which the *Śivadharmavivaraṇa* was transmitted. Thanks to the scholars of Kannada literature and epigraphy at Karnatak University in Dharwar, especially Dr. J. M. Nagaiah, Dr. R. M. Shadakshariah, and Dr. S. V. Padigar, and Dr. Taranatha of Mysore; to the staff and the late director of the Bharata Itihasa Sanshodhak Mandal; to the Hatnur Temple Trust; and to the many employees of the Archaeology Survey of India in Mysore, especially the regional directors who fielded my calls asking for special permissions. A special thanks to Bhimashankar Deshpande for allowing me to access his private collection of rare publications and manuscripts that is the product of a lifetime of independent scholarship, and to Dattaprasad at the trust of the lineage of Dasopanth at Amba Jogai. Thanks to the staff of the British Library for allowing me to spend hours reading and photographing their basically undocumented Kannada and Marathi publications from the India Office collection. I owe an unpayable debt to the many hundreds of people throughout the Deccan who have guided me around their villages and hosted me in their homes. Thank you for the time and kindness you showed a stranger.

Sthaneshwar Timalsina has been a mentor and friend since I was in college. He has inspired me with his vast erudition and depth of wisdom, which he wears so lightly, and his profound and hard-won personal integrity. Over the course of the composition of this work, he has provided me with a number of ingenious resolutions to difficult textual problems and cracked the code on obscure allusions. More fundamentally, it is through decades of dialogue and engagement with him that I have arrived at whatever understanding I possess of what it is like to live within an embodied Tantric imaginary and swim within the ocean of *śāstra*. I am profoundly in his debt, for he has removed obstacles large and small.

[[Px]]
The very same algorithms that have been used to radicalize populations have pushed me deeper than I ever would have ventured into the online world celebrating heritage and epigraphy in South Asia. Where others have found conflict, I have found incredible fellowship, where people from all walks of life come together to collectively make sense of the material landscape, especially in the Heritage and Culture of India group, going strong at 50,000 members. Thanks in particular to Shankar Ajjampura, Thomas Alexander, the late John Anderson, Kathie Brobeck, Sachin Dixit, Pavan Maurya Chakravarti, K. P. Ravi Chandra, Uday Kumar, the late Prakash Manjrekar, Corinna Wessels-Mevissen, Parag Purandare, Amar Reddy, and many others. We have modeled how we can collectively learn together both inside and outside of the academy. Thanks to the great scholar artisan Puttuswamy Gudigar, a living link to *śilpin* traditions of the western Deccan, for sharing about his family traditions, including a *longue durée* association with Shirshangi Devi. A special thanks to the great Jan Brouwer for sharing his fabulous hospitality and *sui generis* erudition about the lived traditions of the artisans of the Deccan in the era before globalization began to flatten the world. His recollections about fieldwork at places like Shirshangi, much of which did not make it into his published writings, proved instrumental in my arriving at core connections between past and present. Thanks as well to Mohit Kaycee for discussing his amazing fieldwork among Dalit religious communities throughout the Deccan, especially the tradition of Mōnappa, and for granting me permission to make use of his photographs of the rituals performed by the *puruvants* of that community who are entangled with the artisan religious imaginary of Shirshangi.

[[Pxi]]
I would be most remiss to fail to acknowledge the benefit I have received from decades’ worth of inspiring engagements with Mark Dyczkowski, both in writing and in person. Beyond answering several of my queries, without Mark and his team at Muktabodha’s arduous labor in the production of open-source e-texts, especially of unpublished works in manuscript, our understanding and access to key parts of interpretive contexts that the current work is founded upon would have been greatly impoverished. In particular, I would likely have never recognized the indispensability of what the *Piṅgalāmata* could contribute to reconstructing the lived religious realities of the Deccan.

My gratitude to the many people whose constructive feedback, encouragement, and insight, in or outside of conference settings, helped make this better, especially those brave souls who read chapters, or who contributed in dialogue to my understanding of specific archives, including Andrea Acri, Ramdas Atkar, Gil Ben-Herut, Daniela Bevilacqua, Shailen Bhandare, David Buchta, Brian Campbell, Indrani Chatterjee, Seema Chauhan, Whitney Cox, Richard Davis, Dušan Deák, Florinda De Simini, Philip Deslippe, the late Simon Digby, Anne Feldhaus, T. Ganesan, Anya Golovkova, Eric Gurevitch, Jack Hawley, Vidula Hemant, the late Alf Hiltebeitel, Sundari Johansen Hurwitt, Jamal Jones, Katherine Kasdorf, Prashant Keshavmurthy, Sachin Ketkar, Shraddha Kumbhojkar, Borayin Larios, Steven Lindquist, the late Gerald MacKenzie Castro, Christine Marrewa-Karwoski, Larry McCrea, Nathan McGovern, Sudipta Munshi, Vasudha Narayanan, John Nemec, Christian Novetzke, Leslie Orr, Arunachandra Pathak, William Pinch, Abdul Aziz Rajput, Srilata Raman, Ajay Rao,

Anusha Rao, James Reich, Tamara Sears, Anna Seastrand, Shubha Shanthamurthy, Caleb Simmons, Caley Smith, Pushkar Sohoni, Davesh Soneji, Hamsa Stainton, Eric Steinschneider, Valerie Stoker, Péter-Dániel Szántó, Sarah Pierce Taylor, Somadeva Vasudeva, Steve Vose, Chris Wallis, and Ben Williams. Thanks to Jim Fitzgerald for sharing selections from his translation of the discussions of *sāmānya dharma* in the *Mokṣadharma* division of the *Śāntiparvan*. I am particularly grateful to Anand Venkatkrishnan for his enthusiastic and informed feedback on a variety of chapters.

Because probabilistic reality, the universe, or the goddess (take your pick) has a wicked sense of humor, the very first work of Indological scholarship that I encountered in my life of my own accord—my freshman year in high school—was contained within an anthology called *The World’s Religions*. The chapters on India, largely curated by Friedhelm Hardy, presented what I now know to be basically the standard emplotment of the history of Indian religions, with one glorious exception. Even at thirteen, it was self-evident that Alexis Sanderson’s “Śaivism and the Tantric Traditions” was something radically different—infinitely more interesting and appealing—than everything else I was encountering in my school’s library. And so, I asked the librarian, “has Alexis Sanderson written anything else?” At that time, the answer seemed to be no. Thankfully for all of us who study India, that is no longer the case. Our all too brief meeting was one of the best moments of my life in the academy. It is self-evident that this work would be inconceivable without his scholarship and the tradition he has engendered. I hope he will find it of some use.

I began reading the *Vratakhaṇḍa* of the *Caturvargacintāmaṇi* a few days after my daughter Amelia took her first consecutive steps. She is ten now, and in the interim she has patiently and with usually impeccable temperament endured her parents dragging her all over the world and all the over the Deccan as well as the piling up of papers—draft after interminable draft—all over the house. Her younger sister Lillian, a COVID baby, missed out on the fun travel but not the Indologically induced clutter. Don’t worry love, Mommy is finally finished looking over Daddy’s dissertation. In this life, if we are lucky, we leave beyond two legacies: our art and our children. This thing that’s clogging up your hard drive is my art. Amelia and Lilian are my children. I have dedicated much of my life to ensuring that both of these two different sorts of priorities thrive and arrive at their full potential. Profound thanks to my parents, David and Stephanie Schwartz, and to my grandparents, for their patience and support. They helped shape me into the person I am today.

This thesis is dedicated to my partner, the mother of my children, and my friend: Elaine Marie Fisher. It began with our first conversation on the steps of 80 Claremont Avenue, you discussing Pūrva Mīmāṃsā, and I, Śākta Tantra. Who knew where that would take us and that it would last a lifetime. In terms of matters both big and small, *Ending the Śaiva Age* is better because Elaine Fisher listened, contested, encouraged, and objected while I brainstormed and rambled and then had the forbearance to read the damn thing over and over again. Particularly in the final stages, her meticulous attention to detail immeasurably improved upon many a translation and ferreted out scores of hidden typographical errors, especially stray *akṣaras* in the footnotes. When it comes to whatever remaining sins of commission or omission, whether intentional or nonintentional, I have committed in undertaking this effort, I ask the reader for their indulgence.

## ABSTRACT

Ending the Śaiva Age: The Rise of the Brāhmaṇa Legalist and the Universalization of Hindu Dharma

By
B. Jason Schwartz

*Ending the Śaiva Age: The Rise of the Brāhmaṇa Legalist and the Universalization of Hindu Dharma* reconstructs the largely unfamiliar site- and community-specific life-worlds that defined the religious mainstream in the early medieval western Deccan in all of their nuanced particularity, resituating them in a robust intellectual, social, and material context. It then recovers the concrete history, mediated by text, document, and stone, of how and why in the middle of the thirteenth century, as part of a conceptual revolution emerging from within the tradition of Brāhmaṇical Dharmaśāstra and situated in the court of the Seuṇa Yādava kings of Maharashtra, these lived realities were deliberately rendered mostly provincial and subaltern, making possible the centering of the more familiar Brāhmaṇical imaginaries of early modernity and the colonial era.

*Ending the Śaiva Age* demonstrates that a tradition of epistemic pluralism—which on methodological grounds asserts that the rules and norms that animate both knowledge systems and embodied lived realities necessarily vary from context to context, necessitating a proliferation of discrete modes of authority and authoritative agents whose autonomous sphere of operations must be
[[Pxvii]]
protected—forms an integral facet of classical Sanskrit thought from its inception. Transposed into the realm of the juridical, such a framework manifests as a capacious legal pluralism that defers to the sovereign right of communities to manage their own affairs in accordance with their own values. Drawing on a vast array of mostly unpublished and unstudied source materials, including documentary records, in Sanskrit, Aiśa, old Kannada, and old Marathi, complemented by ethnographic work and surveys of material culture at over two hundred locations, I argue that it is this juridico-religious imaginary that forms the conditions of possibility for the lived realities that stand behind what Alexis Sanderson has characterized as the Śaiva Age—a period essentially coterminous with the early medieval in South Asia—during which Tantric inflected modes of knowledge shaped the religious mainstream. What we discover when we move from prescriptive revelation to its quotidian instantiation in particularized time and space is that the story of classical Tantra as lived religion embedded in well-respected and well-funded transregional institutions is very much a tale of the pervasive influence within such spaces of non-Brāhmaṇa—even Dalit—agents acting as juridical and religious authorities, playing central roles in both the production and dissemination of religious and cultural meaning as well as enacting the enforcement of disciplinary norms. Indeed, as the present work demonstrates, the documentary sources, built spaces, and material culture that form our primary sites for encountering the early medieval are largely the product of Śūdra and Dalit social agents thoroughly embedded within Śākta Tantric imaginaries. The stories that emerge seriously call into question core presumptions of our standard historiography and pedagogy, which almost exclusively center Brāhmaṇas as hegemonic social and religious authorities at best periodically challenged by subaltern dissenting voices. As I demonstrate in some detail based on my fieldwork, they are also essentially consonant, both theologically and sociologically, with contemporary localized traditions of non-elite Deccani religion in Maharashtra and Karnataka.

Against such a backdrop, it is not an alleged “fragmentation” of a previously unified “Brāhmaṇical normativity” but the curious and sudden muscular assertion, on the cusp of early
[[Pxviii]]
modernity, of an almost iconoclastic drive for unification and standardization—the universalization of Hindu *dharma*—that needs to be accounted for in highly particularized historical terms. Ultimately, what will emerge out of our sources, especially the vast *dharmanibandha*, the *Caturvargacintāmaṇi*, which is here examined in detail for the first time, is the counterintuitive story of an internal revolution in Brāhmaṇical jurisprudence, ritual theory, and statecraft that abruptly called into question and overturned the longstanding radically pluralistic episteme. The result is the sudden unmaking of the institutions and life-worlds that the older consensus had made possible, the Śaiva Age so prominently featured in our title. In other words, to think historically in a particularized fashion about the conditions of possibility for the Indian encounter with early modernity is essentially to tell the story of what was the Śaiva Age and how did it end.

## Introduction 
In the era before India became independent, one of the greatest scholars of Hindi literature— 
and the religious sensibilities contained therein—received a curious invitation. “Professor 
Hazari Prasad Dvivedi1—would you like to sit in among the Dharmaśāstrī councils of Kāśī as 
they set about their deliberations?” Faced with an opportunity to keep the company of 
traditional “learned” authorities, Dvivedi, who in spite what we might imagine was in many 
ways aspirationally a “modern” intellectual,2 responded with trepidation. Indeed, he very 
nearly declined the offer entirely. In the end, he assented to what turned out to be an 
uncomfortable, disquieting evening sitting on the sidelines, spent oscillating between utter 
boredom, disgust, and despair. To our benefit, if not his own, Dvivedi captured his excruciating 
discomfort with what to him seemed the “nonsensical” and counterproductive workings of 
“Hindu” tradition in the pithy and powerful Hindi essay, the “Juridical Council of the Pandits” 
(paṇḍitoṃ kī pañcāyat), to which we are about to turn our attention.3 In its tone, its expressions 
1Throughout much of the twentieth century, Hazari Prasad Dvivedi (1907–1979) was highly regarded as a prolific scholar, a linguist fluent in Prakrit, Sanskrit, and Old Hindi, a writer of poetry and fiction, a public intellectual addressing contemporary issues, as well as an institutional powerhouse, who played a pivotal role in establishing the post-Acharya Ramachandra Shukla study of Hindi literature through his positions at Shantiniketan and Benares Hindu University. Within the contemporary Indian academy, his reputation now primarily rests on his role in the “rediscovery” of the poetry of Kabir as well as his arguments for the foundational influence of the nirguṇa bhakti traditions descending from the Nāth Samprādaya on early modern devotional poetry in Hindi. Among Western scholars of Hindu traditions, in contrast, he is now best known as the “father” of the historiographical metanarrative of a “Bhakti Movement” (bhakti āndolan), on which, see more below. Hazari Prasad Dvivedi, Kabīra: Kabīra ke Vyaktittva, Sāhitya aura Dārśanika Vicāroṃ kī Ālocanā (Bombay: Hindi Grantha Ratnakara, 1964); Hazari Prasad Dvivedi, Nātha-sampradāya (Allahbad: Lokabharati Prakasana, 1950). 2As the Brāhmaṇa son of a professional jyotiṣa trained in the canons of Sanskrit astrology and partially educated in a traditional pāṭhaśālā, Dvivedi was often perceived by wider publics as offering a perfect marriage of mastery over traditional śāstric knowledge with the ethos of the modernizing Nehruvian elites. As his own collected essays (including the text we will begin by examining) makes apparent, however, Dvivedi saw himself in very different terms, essentially as a reformist Western intellectual who worked on traditional materials while being basically estranged from the life-worlds of which they were a part. 3 Hazari Prasad Dvivedi, “Paṇḍitoṃ kī Pañcāyat,” in Hazarī Prasād Dvivedī Granthāvalī, vol. 9, ed. Mukund Dvivedi (Delhi: Rajamohan Prakashan, 1981): 454–460. The original date of composition, not specified in the anthology, is somewhat obscure, but it is clearly a product of the period when he when he was living in Varanasi, pursuing graduate studies in astrology (1920–1929) under the mentorship of Madan Mohan Malaviya, the Swaraj activist and founder of Benares Hindu University. It is thus a product of Dvivedi’s early career, prior to his meeting Rabindranath Tagore in 1930, and heavily reflects Malaviya’s influence. For a nuanced study of this 
1 
of alienation, as well as its specific topical and conceptual focuses, one could hardly imagine 
a more perfect point of departure for our own intellectual journey. For what troubles Dvivedi 
is precisely what will occupy our own attention—nothing less than making sense of the 
inexplicable history of radical pluralism4 as a problematic within Hindu thought, jurisprudence, 
exegesis, and ritual praxis. To pursue such a story to its conclusion entails nothing less than 
rethinking much of what we think we know about Brāhmaṇical authority and the varied places 
it has occupied in the history of Indian religions.5 
important figure in the history of the Indian independence movement, who also played a pivotal role in the early movement against indentured labor and untouchability while drifting into a proto-Hindu Nationalist position in his later years, see Jagannath Prasad Misra, Madan Mohan Malaviya and the Indian Freedom Movement (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2016). 4 In the context of the study of South Asia in particular, regardless of the period under discussion, the concept of pluralism is often equated with an intrinsically positive valence and aligned with the humanist liberal democratic values of the Nehruvian state. These presentist concerns are only partially aligned with premodern historical realities, whether in India or elsewhere, wherein what we label pluralism is essentially a methodological choice entailing vesting discrete authority in multiple independent spheres of activity, which are then viewed as at least partially organized according to distinctive norms. This methodological choice is most typically applied as a juridical framework that enables one to think about the existence of multiple sites for legal adjudication within “the same society.” Indeed, outside of South Asia, “pluralism” most often appears in our archives as aligned with the management of multicultural, multireligious and multiethnic empires. 5Much of the wider discipline of Religious Studies is heavily invested in demonstrating that the term “religion” is not an ontological given locatable out in the world but is instead a synthetic formulation that is a culturally mediated product of the human mind. On the basis of the fact that the category is contingent, internally contested from its inception, with varied content over its history, and that its early lexical history and pre-academic development emerges out of Latin sources, its naive application to other cultures is frequently called into question. Such observations are essentially quite sound. Logically speaking, however, the very same critiques equally apply to all of the synthetic categories—history, politics, economics, society, and so forth—that populate our academic imaginaries. In other words, “history”—let alone history writing—is no more a given thing to be found out there in than world than is “religion.” The moment we take seriously the foundational genre conventions and compositional practices that governed early historical compositions in the Attic world, many of which cast a long shadow into early modernity—such as the justification for the historian composing the speeches a historical figure ought to have said in place of using documentary records, explicit instructions that history is primarily concerned with the deeds of certain types of elite male social agents, or the deliberate exclusion of reflection on technological change or “cultural matters” from historical writing, there is a salient case to be made that the premodern West does not “know” or make use of “history” or engage in historical writing. Thus, “history” as a concept, just like religion, would be a construction of the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century academy whose existence has been anachronistically read back into the past and projected on to other cultures. Ironically, again, if we read selectively and work with specific definitions, a parallel case could also be made that while the ancient Greeks and their early modern descendants did not “know of the discipline” we call history, “historical” writing aligned with modern parameters, incorporating the agency of women and non-elite figures, making use of primary documentary sources where available, and including incorporating accounts of technology, culture, and art, does exist in Han China in the writings of figures like Sima Qian. This is to say, just like religion, history starts from stipulative definitions whose parameters of inclusion and exclusion determine what we take into our purview. 
2 
Much like Dvivedi, we will discover that such discourses are not simply sui generis. 
They have specific and recoverable histories that bear witness to changes in sensibility, society, 
and circumstance. Just like Dvivedi, we also will come to recognize that seemingly abstract 
and abstruse scholastic methodological choices, often the focus of a more insular approach to 
intellectual history, are not hermetically sealed off from the rest of reality but had—and 
continue to have—palpable real-world social and political ramifications that speak in 
fundamental ways to the core concerns of scholars of Indian religions, indeed of religion in 
general. But whereas Dvivedi’s account will read into the historical archive a tale of tragic 
fragmentation, where an utterly unmanageable degree of diversity is provoked by a 
comparatively recent crisis that upends the classical world order, what we will recover is a 
wealth of evidence pointing in the direction of very different conclusions. 
Succinctly, taking as its focus the underexamined realities of the early medieval 
western Deccan,6 this work recovers a deep history of the post-Gupta era7 wherein Indian 
In stipulative and functional terms, for the purpose of this investigation, the study of Indian religions can be defined as a discipline that takes as its object all of the archives, practices, and imaginaries of considerable significance to emic social agents in situ, that the institutional history of the modern academy outside of the discipline of religious studies tend to exclude from their considerations of what constitutes meaningful and historically or socially impactful knowledge. 6 The term “Deccan” is derived from the old Kannada dakkhaṇa, which in turn is a vernacularization of the Sanskrit word “dakṣiṇa.” Taken literally, it simply means “the South.” In practice, however, the term has a number of different valences mediated through both topographical and linguistic imaginaries. Geographically, it has typically referred to the area of India that is south of the Narmadā River and thus excludes the Indo-Gangetic Plain that comprises the central focus of so much of early Indian literature and history. In all formulations, it incorporates most of the Deccan plateau (avg. 2,000 ft above sea level) wedged between the Western and Eastern Ghat mountain ranges and the entirety of Deccan traps, comprising most of Maharashtra, which is one of the largest volcanic formations in the world and formed around the time of the extinction of the dinosaurs. Its southernmost boundary is somewhat more variable, either the far bank of the Godāvarī (which would exclude much of southern Karnataka and Maharashtra) or the Kāverī River. When defined in linguistic terms, the Deccan encompasses most of the regions occupied by mother tongue speakers of Marathi, Kannada, and Telugu and alludes to their intertwined political and cultural histories. When we speak of the western Deccan, we simply exclude from our purview most of the modern-day Telugu speaking regions (eastern Telangana and Andhra), especially the topographically and culturally distinct region of coastal Andhra. 7 The elevation of the Gupta-Vākāṭaka empire (c. 300–550 CE) as the crowning achievement of Hindu India and the unique progenitors of a kind of classical ethos against which all subsequent dynasties are to be compared is largely the product of Western and colonial era historiography, as is the periodization of Indian history in alignment with their floruit. As Hans Bakker has suggested, a more logical break point for those keen on 
3 
religions are virtually defined—not by a canonical orthodoxy or even orthopraxy—but by their 
embrace of a capacious epistemological and legal pluralism that underwrites religious 
diversity. It is this framework for institutionalizing and conserving diverse modes of doing and 
being that ultimately promotes the flourishing of a myriad of often localized distinctive life- 
worlds, aligned with an array of social agents drawn from across the spectrum of caste and 
class, with their own modes of sociality and disciplinarity, canons of authority, modes of 
exegesis, and approaches to ritual. It is to such social forms, it will be suggested, that the Indian 
subcontinent owes much of its rich panoply of beliefs and ways of life in the domain of religion, 
anchored in the recognition of the possibility of multiple competing sources for authoritative 
knowledge, features which have persisted down into the present in a manner that makes 
essentializing “Hinduism,” intrinsically a problematic category, such a slippery endeavor. 
Against such a backdrop, it is not an alleged “fragmentation” but the curious and 
sudden muscular assertion, on the cusp of early modernity, of an almost iconoclastic drive for 
unification and standardization that needs to be accounted for in highly particularized historical 
terms.8 Ultimately, what will emerge out of our sources is the counterintuitive story of an 
periodization is not dynastic succession (for indeed the Guptas persisted in diminished form for some more decades) but rather the disruptive impact caused by the invasion and conquest of much of northwestern India by the Alkhan Huns starting ca. 490 CE. As Bakker argues, there are good reasons to see this infusion of a new ruling political class aligned with new patronage interests as having major repercussions for the sudden onset of the Śaiva Age. Hans T. Bakker, The Alkhan: A Hunnic People in South Asia (Eelde: Barkhuis, 2020). More pertinently for our purposes, everything that happens on the subcontinent between the fall of the Guptas and the rise of Delhi Sultanate tends to be assigned to the somewhat vacuous and thoroughly teleologically charged label “early medieval India.” Medieval India, in contrast, in South Asian historiography, refers almost exclusively to the study of the Indo-Persian world and its sources. 8 As the reader may already have intuited, such concerns partially overlap with the vast historiography that has developed around the question of the “invention of Hinduism,” within which proponents tend to be divided into two camps. The first of these, aligned with the academic project of the invention of world religions, treat the emergence of “Hinduism,” mostly at first among a partially Westernized Indian bourgeois elite, (Brian Pennington, Brian Hatcher, etc.) as a product of the colonial encounter whereby Western categories and sensibilities impact and reshape Indian religions substantively in its own image. The second, exemplified by Andrew Nicholson and David Lorenzen, asserts that an incipient unification prefiguring a unitary Hinduism vis- à-vis imagined others emerges in the fourteenth century, coinciding with and perhaps in response to the Islamic encounter. See for instance Brian Pennington, Was Hinduism Invented? Britons, Indians, and the Colonial Construction of Religion (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005); Brian Hatcher, Hinduism Before Reform

internal revolution in Brāhmaṇical jurisprudence, ritual theory, and statecraft that abruptly 
called into question and overturned the longstanding radically pluralistic episteme. The result 
is the sudden unmaking of the institutions and life-worlds that the older consensus had made 
possible, the Śaiva Age so prominently featured in our title.9 This revolution proved so 
successful that it normalized its practices and presuppositions such that they came to appear 
inseparable from the general fabric of much of everyday Hindu traditions. This, then, is the 
story we will be pursuing over the coming pages. As we will see, when the tale is told, the 
evidence put before the reader has profound ramifications for how we think about and teach 
the histories of Hinduism(s). But before we tell it, as catalyst for our own investigation, let us 
see how Dvivedi, a product of colonial-era Indian knowledge production, emplots his own 
account of historical change within Hindu knowledge and religiosity, reflecting on what this 
can tell us about the precarious place the questions we are asking have occupied thus far within 
the study of Indian religions. 
(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2020); Andrew Nicholson, Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History (New York: Columbia University Press, 2013); David Lorenzen, Who Invented Hinduism: Essays on Religion in History (New Delhi: Yoda Press, 2006). 
In contrast, “Ending the Śaiva Age” suggests that rather than a single seminal moment, “the invention of Hinduism” is best understood as an ongoing process. It has multiple internal developments and regional and community-specific inflections (such as the Tamil Brāhmaṇa Smārta-Śaiva traditions excavated in Fisher’s Hindu Pluralism), each of which demands to be treated on its own terms. Elaine Fisher, Hindu Pluralism: Religion and the Public Sphere in Early Modern South India (Oakland, CA: University of California Press, 2017). Essentially, “Brāhmaṇism” as a conceptual object is a product of the colonial encounter, which radically reforms human sociality while the existence of various Brāhmaṇa traditions that assume a new centrality in early modernity, independent of colonialism, is not. 
The current we are following documents the articulation of a new orthodoxy that emerges dialogically and polemically out of a network of regionalized Brāhmaṇa communities in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and eventually becomes constitutive of the worldview of many Deśastha Brāhmaṇas. Its defining interlocutor is not “alien” religions or societies but long-standing often Śaiva-inflected early medieval institutional norms. In other words, the present study treats Brāhmaṇism on the cusp of early modernity within the western Deccan as an insurgent, one might even say subaltern, religious development that suddenly acquires hegemonic control over institutional spaces. 9 On “The Śaiva Age,” see Alexis Sanderson, “The Śaiva Age—The Rise and Dominance of Śaivism during the Early Medieval Period,” in Genesis and Development of Tantrism, ed. Shingo Einoo (Tokyo: University of Tokyo, Institute of Oriental Culture), 41–349.

A World Lit Only by Nanus?10: A Colonized Imagination Confronts Its Past 
Hazari Prasad Dvivedi received his invitation to sit among the councils of learned Brāhmaṇas 
on a very specific occasion. The pandits of Kāśī, we learn, were meeting to talk about the 
scheduling of the ekādaśī (eleventh day of the new moon) in the month of Vaiśakh (late April- 
May), an important time for religious activities. More specifically, they wanted to associate 
unilateral observance of the ekādaśī rituals with a specific calendar day. On the surface, which 
is how Dvivedi will perceive the whole affair, the problem was purely technical. Some people 
wanted to celebrate on Thursday while others preferred Friday. As there were astrological 
cases to be made in support of both arrangements, it was up to the pandits to determine which 
date was better supported by the canons of traditional knowledge. Though the decision itself 
bore considerable implications, the deliberative mechanisms at work, operating independent 
of specific subject matter, were of a piece with the quotidian application of Brāhmaṇical 
ritualist-legal knowledge as presented in the juridical literature of early modernity. 
From the deeper perspective of the competing traditions contained within early modern 
Sanskrit Dharmaśāstra, however, something of much more substance seems to have been at 
stake.11 What was on the table was nothing less than whether the rules that ordered a shared 
10Apte defines the Sanskrit indeclinable nanu in the following manner: “ननु ind. (Originally a combination of न and नु, now used as a separate word) A particle implying: 1 Inquiry or interrogation. . . . In argumentative discussions ननु is frequently used to head an objection or advance a contrary proposition.” 11 Thus, for example, in the Samayaprakāśa of the vast and decidedly Vaiṣṇava-aligned seventeenth-century dharmanibandha, the Vīramitrodaya, Mitramiśra dedicates eighteen pages of dense śāstric prose (pg. 57–74), interwoven with proof texts from the Purāṇas as well as earlier Dharmaśāstrins, adjudicating the differences between Vaiṣṇava ekādaśī and Smārta ekādaśī and proclaiming the superiority of the former arrangement over the latter. The discussion in fact prefaces an earlier and much more curt but pointed dismissal of the legitimacy of purely Śaiva calendrical arrangements, which have their own peculiarities. Vishnu Prasad Sharma, ed., Vīramitrodaya [samayaprakasha] of M. M. Pt. Mitra Mishra, vol 10. (Varanasi: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series, 1987). In contrast, taking the opposite position, in the same century, the Deśastha Marathi Brāhmaṇa Kamalākara Bhaṭṭa dedicates ten pages (pg. 34–44), of his Nirṇayasindhu (now usually transmitted with a Hindi or Marathi commentary) to taking the opposite position, championing the Smārta stance. This is in fact one of the very works Hazari Prasad Dvivedi will ultimately denounce as emblematic of pointless arcane disputation, presumably without having read it. Krishna Shastri Navare, ed., Nirṇayasindhu yāṃce Marāṭhī Bhāṣāṃtara (Pune: Mystic Worship Publishing, 2000).

social reality would align more perfectly with sectarian Vaiṣṇava, or Smārta, or even Śākta- 
Śaiva sensibilities. To be concise, in early modern north India, across a vast corpus of both 
published and unpublished works, the date of the observance of ekādaśī and the prohibition of 
alternatives had become significant sites for sectarian contestation.12 This was no neutral 
choice of one calendrical arrangement over another. Part of what was potentially being decided 
that night was “whose Hinduism” represented the mainstream. The law in all its abstract 
majesty was intervening in ongoing debates to overdetermine what constituted an acceptable 
religious reality. 
Dvivedi, however, though aware of the rules, is oblivious to these longstanding 
conversations as well as to the particularities of the actual practice of these pandits and their 
specific sectarian ramifications. From his perspective, what he is witnessing is a needlessly 
convoluted and antiquated approach to disinterested inquiry. In other words, for Dvivedi, in 
Though usually overlooked by the north Indian dharmanibandha traditions, early modern Śākta ritual manuals presenting themselves as nibandhas—for example, the unpublished writing of the again seventeenth-century polymath and rājaguru Śivānanda Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmin—also offer their own calculations reflecting variant methodologies, including a cut-out that allows for the consumption of ritually required substances during the midnight tantric sandhyā on what are technically “fast days.” To distill a much more complicated issue down to its essentials, the Smārta model is that the observance of the eleventh phase of the moon (ekādaśī) and all its incumbent vow, begins at whatever time the sun rises (aruṇodaya) locally. In all cases, however, where the ninety- six-minute period of sunrise still overlaps at any point with the calculation of the tenth phase of the moon, ekādaśī is considered “contaminated” and should not be observed. Vaiṣṇavas differ primarily in extending the period when the daśamī “contaminates” and blocks the ekādaśī observance by an additional ninety-six minutes before the period of sunrise. In pragmatic terms, what this means is that on average several times a year, Vaiṣṇavas will begin their fast for ekādaśī one day after Smārtas. The reason this matters in practical terms is that many authoritative proof texts, likely with highly polemical sectarian origins, explicitly prohibit in the direst terms imaginable fasting and performing other ekādaśī observances either the day before or the day after the rite is supposed to start on pain of repeated rebirth as a worm festering in feces for many ages. In more recent times, printers of astrological calendars containing ritual calculations (pañcāṅga) now simply habitually label both the Vaiṣṇava and Smārta ekādaśī observance days for a given year. While ritual analysis of this sort dominates the dharma literature well into the colonial period, as we will discover in this study, prior to the eleventh century, it is entirely absent from the discourse of Dharmaśāstra. 12 In English, very little has written about this weaponization of calendrical constraints in the service of sectarian ends, and our substantial treatments in European languages are primarily concerned with Rajasthan in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. For similar topics, see for example: Monika Horstmann, Der Zusammenhalt der Welt: Religiöse Herrschaftslegitimation und Religionspolitik Maharaja Savai Jaisinghs (1700-1743) (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2014); Catherine Clémentin-Ojha, Le Trident sur le Palais: Une Cabale Anti- Vishnouite dans un Royaume Hindou à l’Époque Colonial (Paris: École Française d’Extrême-Orient, 1999). For a short representation of parallel dynamics in relation to the Tamil south, see Elaine Fisher, Hindu Pluralism, 124. 
7deciding on the proper date for observing ekādaśī, Dharmaśāstra deliberation aims to arrive at 
a singular objective truth essentially consonant with modern Western scientific knowledge. 
Confronted by the superior canons of modern astronomical knowledge, which, he presumes, 
offer profound challenges to the way traditional authorities have understood their discipline 
and engaged in calculation, as he sees it, India has to respond on its own terms, just as it had 
done in the past. That response entails taking up the empirical evidence on hand, which just 
happens to be found scattered across the Sanskrit sources, and scrutinizing it until the “correct” 
arrangement has been recovered. As you may already be beginning to see, Dvivedi's horizon 
of possibility is a nationalist imagination that narrates India’s past as a mixture of apologetics 
and outright apology. 
In this spirit, in lieu of representing the complex navigations of community-specific 
meaning and inclusion with which he is confronted, Dvivedi proposes the first of the series of 
binary structural dichotomies that will provide his essay with its structure. He accomplishes 
this by juxtaposing two imagined paradigms, which he sees as contained within the Sanskrit 
knowledge systems, and then offering us an imagined history of how they came to be. As the 
present study frames itself as a point-by-point response to the terms of his investigation, it is 
worth taking some time to understand Dvivedi’s governing framework as expressed in his pithy 
Hindi essay on its own terms. 
The first of Dvivedi’s imagined paradigms for the production of Sanskrit knowledge is 
the classical Indian search for “objective empirical truth” through “independent thought” 
(svatantra cintanā) to which, from his perspective, the better angels of Dharmaśāstra aspire.13 
13 Hazari Prasad Dvivedi, “Paṇḍitoṃ kī Pañcāyat,” p. 455: us in kisī kī himmat nahī thī ki ācārya ko śāstra par jabardastī karanevālā kahe, kyoṃki vah svatantra cintā kā yug thā / bhāratīya samāj itanā rūḍhipriya aur parāpekṣī nahī thā / vah le bhī saktā thā aur de bhī saktā thā / maiṃne dekhā, brahmagupt ke śiṣya bhāskarācārya nirbhīk 
8 
This value system, identified as a precursor to his own mode of scholarship, is epitomized by 
ancient Sanskrit pandits (in this case primarily astrologers) such as Varāhamihira, Āryabhaṭṭa, 
and, above all, Bhāskarācārya, who proclaimed that reasoning (yukti) is the one and only source 
of authority (pramāṇa), not scripture (āgama). Within such a framework, while opinions were 
many, ultimately, “truth” could only be singular. The quest of scholarship was to find this 
“truth,” a task best achieved through independent reasoning that was not reliant on another 
(parāpekṣī). The medium in which that quest was to take place was the domain of the classical 
Sanskrit śāstras. In their own antediluvian manner, Dvivedi tells us, they aspired after “the 
facts” and sought right modes of knowing and reasoning. 
On the other side of the divide, standing in opposition to “independent thought,” 
according to Dvivedi were situated the desiccated standards that dominated Sanskrit 
knowledge in the present age of colonialism and whose rise to prominence is seen as coinciding 
with India’s decline. This “newer” mode of knowledge, for Dvivedi, is replete with over-the- 
top pedantry and committed to a slavish subservience to past opinion. Perhaps most 
importantly, as we will see in a moment, its core objectives are themselves perceived to be 
misguided. Instead of seeking to figure out “what is true” and then programmatically applying 
clear and correct principles in the service of consistently arriving at a single correct answer, 
mere punditry of this sort foolishly sets out to curate and then justify the existence of multiple 
convoluted and counterfactual traditions. Rather than taking a stand as a matter of integrity and 
conscience, in Dvivedi’s understanding, this mode of “knowledge” rationalizes away 
contradiction in the service of reconciling “what should be done” with actual lived practice 
bhāv se kah rahe hai, ‘is gaṇita skandh me yukti hī ekamātra pramāṇ hai, koī bhī āgam pramāṇ nahī / yah bāt solah āne sahī thī aur bhāratīya paṇḍit-maṇḍalī ko sahī bāt svīkār karane kā sāhas thā / par āj kyā hālat hai? 
9 
and values, however much these might depart from the clear message of the texts or the 
workings of reason. 
For Dvivedi, who offers us history as a morality play, such renunciation of 
“independent thought” that seeks out certainty is nothing less than a form of moral cowardice. 
The theology of a subjugated people, its primary site of dissemination is none other than the 
genre of dharmanibandha14—the locus of early modern Hindu law—which is seen as the 
product of a cultural crisis engendered by a violent encounter with the “invading West.” Let 
us see what Dvivedi has to say in his own words; the passage is rich and troubling enough to 
warrant quoting at some length: 
14 In his recent unpublished work, Patrick Olivelle has helpfully periodized the history of Dharmaśāstra over the first and early second millennium in accordance with changes in the primary genres of textual production used to articulate juridical imaginaries. Thus, we can speak initially of the age of the Dharmasūtras (c. 200 BCE–100 CE), followed by an era of Dharmaśāstra treatises (such as Mānavadharmaśāstra, ca. 300 CE) and Yājñavalkya (Gupta era). This in turn was succeeded by a period when the primary production in the realm of law was in Dharmaśāstra commentary (sixth–tenth centuries CE), offering word by word glosses and exegesis of works of Dharmaśāstra and Sūtra as well as within the poorly understood genre of Dharmasaṃgraha, anonymous works compiling collections of inherited legal dictums. As Olivelle is in the process of demonstrating, the defining trajectory of the history of Dharmaśāstra as a discipline is the considerable increase over time of both the number and range of independent legal authorities being cited. 
This dynamic reaches its culmination with the emergence, during the twelfth century, of a new genre called the dharmanibandha. Within compositions that are an order of magnitude larger in scale than any of the preceding dharma literature, dharmanibandhas compile citations drawn from hundreds if not thousands of discrete authorities writing in Sanskrit into vast topic-specific compendia. As we will discover, their authors then curate these elements in the service of making extra-textual arguments through creative exegesis and selective proof texting. A key feature of the new genre, integral to our own investigation, is that it seeks to expand the conceptual scope of what types of materials and practices fall under the domain of the dharma literature. The two earliest surviving works in the genre, the partially preserved Kṛtyakāmadhenu of Gopāla and the Kṛtyakalpataru of Lakṣmīdhara, were both composed in the court of the Gāhaḍavāla King Govindacandra (c. 1114–1155 CE). The thirteenth century sees the composition of two major dharmanibandha works within the Deccan. These are Smṛticandrikā of Devaṇṇa Bhaṭṭa, whose contents do not overlap with our interests, and the Caturvargacintāmaṇi of Hemādri Sūri (ca. 1240–1260), which will stand at the center of our analysis. The composition of new works of dharmanibandha, nearly all of which have yet to be studied, proliferates into the colonial period.

At the time I was pondering this, the pandits were flipping through the pages of the Nirṇayasindhu15 and Dharmasindhu.16 They were reading statements from various well-known and obscure sages, Purāṇas, and Saṃhitās and “forging connections.”17 Becoming somewhat distressed, I was thinking, “why were these nibandhas written?” It struck me that, in the West, a self-confident religion had been born that does not compromise with anything, does not consider anyone a friend. From the assault of the stern saber in its right hand, the iron ramparts of great civilizations were shattered, and with its left hand through the nectar of assurance, the masses of people, defeated, arise to a new life and a new glory. Those who become subject to it become stained head to toe in its color. That is Islam. 
Islam, its chest puffed up with victory, challenges Indian culture. Northern India is assailed by its incessant attacks. . . . Maharashtra becomes committed to taking a stand against new attacks, and in accordance with Indian beliefs, first among all, is ready to defend its own dharma. . . . 
Indian pandits had never scrutinized their heaps of scriptural utterances with such diligence. . . . For just a moment, it occurred to me that the Indian people had renounced independent thought completely; just commentaries (ṭīkā), just nibandhas, just compilation (saṃgraha-grantha)!. . . . No statement of the scriptures is being omitted, no sage is being neglected, but with terrifying erudition, the prevailing social rules are supported. Whatever statement of the sages is found to be in opposition to these rules is relegated to the dissenting position (pūrvapakṣa) with a mere “some people might say” (nanu), and the preordained conclusion (uttarapakṣa) invariably supports the practices of place (sthānīya ācāra). In the idiom of the pandits, this is what is called “forging connections” (saṅgati lagānā). This form of forging connections seemed to me to be the biggest weakness of an Indian religion whose pride is shattered. I could not comprehend why a little mouse was being dug out of these immense mountains of quotations from scriptures. 
15 The Nirṇayasindhu is a seventeenth-century work of dharmanibandha specifically concerned with adjudicating the temporalization of religious practices as observed by a range of “Hindu” communities within a shared Smārta calendar. It is also the rare work of Dharmaśāstra that has continued to be actively utilized, albeit mediated through Hindi and Marathi commentarial glosses, into the twenty-first century. The author, Kamalākara Bhaṭṭa, though largely active in Varanasi, was a Deśastha Maharashtrian Brāhmaṇa who descended from the most important family of Smārta Dharmaśāstrin polymaths of the early modern period, a key element of whose intellectual production entails infusing traditional Brāhmaṇical knowledge systems with theistic devotional attitudes. As we will see, the entire intellectual project in which these scholars are engaged is self-consciously indebted to the works and vision of Hemādri. 16 Composed in 1790–91 CE, in southern Maharashtra, the Dharmasindhu of Kāśīnātha Upādhye is an adaptation of the Nirṇayasindhu that also integrates elements from a range of other Smārta works, including other treatises by Kamalākara while largely dispensing with many of the elements of hyper scholasticism rooted in traditions of Pūrva Mīmāṃsā exegesis that were integrated into prior works of this type. The result is essentially a reference guide for the basic parameters entailed in the performance of major rituals, with the first portion being arranged calendrically and the concluding portion offering a concise digest of the key dimensions of major Brāhmaṇical rituals as well as the standing position about major ritual controversies shorn of the polemical back and forth. 17 This Hindi phrase, saṅgati lagānā, as Dvivedi clarifies, is an idiom employed by the pandit communities he was dialoguing with to capture the art of extracting conclusions from the interrelated networks of citations across the corpus of Dharmaśāstra and Nibandha literature.

This definitive decision (nirṇaya) regarding the fast of ekādaśī was being undertaken right in front of me, with hundreds of verses by dozens of ācāryas being quoted. What importance does it hold in and of itself, that in times past hundreds of pandits had painfully and diligently written hundreds of nibandhas on it and that today, with their help, the pandits of the entire Indian nation from Rāma’s Bridge up through Himachal are to make a definitive decision concerning when to perform a vow! Was it not enough to fast on any one day with devotion?. . . . To me the sky of the medieval seemed so opaque with the hazy rain from torrential phrases, like “some people say” (nanu), “and likewise" (tathā ca), and “it is said” (uktaṃ ca) and so forth, that the learned people of the twentieth century, even after many attempts, could not get at the real problem of the Dharmaśāstrins (nibandhakāra). I again wondered why a little mouse was being dug out of these immense mountains of quotations from scriptures.18

In this fascinating passage, Dvivedi offers his reader a polemical characterization of 
the mechanics that purportedly underlie early modern śāstra as well as a just-so story about 
how Sanskrit knowledge and Indian religions took on their current characteristics. Succinctly, 
the catalyst for transitioning away from a “classical” evidence-driven Sanskritic tradition 
founded upon the independent exercise of objective judgement to a bookish one that embraced 
slavish conformity to convention was the coming of Islam. In this emplotment, the emergence 
of new textual genres, especially the dharmanibandha, the primary mode of Dharmaśāstra 
production in the early modern period, as well as a new “context driven” mode of Brāhmaṇical 
reasoning that attends to the practices of place (sthānīya ācāra), is best understood as a 
temporary defensive measure whereby a civilization sought to preserve its knowledge in the 
face of a new kind of threat.19 However, as perhaps warranted and well intentioned as this 
modality was initially, its continuation into the present has proven its own kind of calamity, 
perpetuating a compromise of will and values. As a result, for generations, some of India's 
most brilliant men have wasted away their lives digging through mountains of scriptural 
resources to catch measly mouse-sized citations instead of applying their own critical reason. 
In Dvivedi’s reading, the very idea that both general scholarly discourse as well as that 
which pertained specifically to religion should attend to the local (sthānīya ācāra), the 
contextual, or matters of relevance (saṅgati), is an alien imposition on Indic thought. It arises 
from a traumatized people who have lost their pride. Relief for such despairing and confused 
souls would come—not from the now compromised domain of the śāstras—but from a new 
19As will become clear later on in this chapter, Hazari Prasad Dvivedi indirectly inherits this temporalization of “site-specific” pluralist practices against uniform codes of values, with each treated as reflective of different moments in historical time, from a tradition of Western thinking about law and power. Standing in opposition to the modern state, our working dichotomization of “feudalism” is largely constituted by the decision to treat what is essentially natural law, the notion that a single law originally undergirds the world order, placed in opposition to “legal positivism,” which recognizes the longstanding governing norms of specific communities as legitimate, as reflecting different periods in human thought as opposed to as concurrent and competing legal imaginaries. 
13 
universal meta-language whose principles applied in every place and every time. It would 
come from bhakti. In place of a medieval śāstric sky full of “nanus,” India would have its 
“Storm of Songs.” Here at last we arrive at the Hazari Prasad Dvivedi with whom, thanks to 
the incisive historiographical detective work of John Stratton Hawley, the Western academy is 
familiar, a man whose primary legacy to posterity is originating the metanarrative of the bhakti 
movement (bhakti āndolan).20 As Hawley has brilliantly shown us in his Storm of Songs, this 
logic of the bhakti movement both periodizes the history of Hindu thought and projects a 
shared intentionality onto the staggered emergence of different devotional compositional 
modalities across the various regions of the subcontinent. In doing so, under the banner of what 
are taken to be shared literary forms and genres, it tells us tales that seek to unite a nation. 
Frequently, the stories being related are imbued with the sensibilities of many of these same 
poets and sants. For them, bhakti is something ever new, present, particular, and wonderous, 
while the śāstras of the pandits are outmoded, and stale, always abstracted from the lived 
experience of actual human beings, paradoxically, even as it tries to accommodate them. In a 
sense, here too “context” reaches India with the coming of Islam. But what proves a calamity 
for Sanskrit learning unexpectedly breathes new life and possibility into devotional verse. If 
pure śāstra was the language of the classical past, once its integrity was compromised, Dvivedi 
proposes, bhakti would become the language of the present. 
20 Dvivedi, appearing in a variety of roles, is virtually the protagonist of Jack Hawley’s magisterial study of bhakti historiography. For Dvivedi’s contributions to critiquing Ramchandra Shukla’s saguṇa centric account Hindi devotional literature, see Hawley (2015) pg. 44–45, 49–50. For Hawley’s recovery of Dvivedi’s role in adapting the model of a bhakti movement based on a creative misreading of George Grierson, see Hawley (2015) pg. 50– 58.

Especially in the past several decades, with great erudition, skill, and style, other 
scholars have dedicated themselves to developing a multilingual meteorology describing what 
transpired when the Indian sky was full of songs. In contrast, the present study will begin by 
directing our attention to Hazari Prasad Dvivedi’s “other sky,” the world before bhakti, in 
which snippets of commentarial Sanskrit21—and not much else—hang there naked in the void 
as all about them swirl a vague and obscuring miasma of meaningless vapors. In other words, 
we encounter texts, devoid of even the possibility of meaningful context, suspended in mid-air 
as they plummet to the earth. Think about it for a moment—all this indeterminacy. It looks 
eerily like a certain facet of the Indological imagination, especially when it attends to the India 
subcontinent prior to the second millennium of the Common Era. We have texts—so many 
texts—but we do not know where they came from. We do not even know “when” they came 
from—if by when, in laymen’s terms, you anticipate the presentation of a date and not a range 
of several hundred or so years. Through the smoke and fog it is even difficult to place the 
sources in relation to each other. It is all texts without contexts. And as for the matter of “who,” 
at best the “author function” is just a name, occasionally repeated across several works, or 
popping up here and there in the writings of opponents who are similarly prosopographical 
near blank slates. Here too the past is indeterminate, colorless, contextless. Devoid of richly 
realized protagonists, Indian premodernity is instead inhabited by disembodied doctrinal 
assertions and canons of dogma. In this emplotment, the Indian past remains inconceivable 
until the arrival of “outsiders”—whether Islamic or European—who process the world in a 
21For a good point of orientation to what this type of discourse entails see Gary A. Tubb and Emery R. Boose, Scholastic Sanskrit: A Handbook for Students (New York: American Institute of Buddhist Studies, 2007). For a more comprehensive treatment of śāstric modes of reasoning and specialized learned idiom one might also consult: Michel Angot, Le Sanskrit Commentarial (Paris: Societé d’édition Les Belles Lettres, 2017). 
15 
different way.22 This “difference” is then (presumably) transferred to the Indic directly, 
perhaps under duress, or else acquired by osmosis. Outside of the texts themselves, a priori to 
the arrival of these “others” on the scene, to speak of meaningful and particularized social 
contexts for Indian thought and belief and practice—let alone to imagine the makers of these 
life-worlds—would seem to be like proposing to the biological daughter of a barren woman 
while handing her a bouquet of sky-flowers. 
Before we step away from troubled—and in some ways quite troubling—young 
Dvivedi to chart our own course into India’s deep past, he has one last piece of the puzzle to 
bequeath to us. While his vision of a “classical” Hindu past, in this regard like so many of his 
contemporaries, is strangely drab, featureless and underdeveloped, largely inhabited by 
Sanskrit subhāṣitas and philosophical precepts, instead of a variety of richly realized men and 
women embedded in particularized social circumstances and traditions of practice, there is a 
conspicuous and telling exception in his account in “The Legal Assembly of the Pandits.” For, 
in Dvivedi’s metanarrative, as Islam rushes in heralding calamitous transformations and 
reordering of possibility, in thirteenth-century Maharashtra, one proud and highly particular 
man lifts his head to the face the incoming onslaught and played his part in the drama. 
But however it may seem today, the advent of the age of commentary was not entirely devoid of purpose. I saw it clearly; the decimated culture of India is standing in front of Hemādri. His face has become saddened. He looks out with a hollow gaze, his eyes filled with tears. His lotus face has withered. The circumscribed countenance of Hemādri’s face is somber; his brow furrows a little. The lines of worry bulge forth on his enormous forehead. He bites his lower lip. His gaze falls upon some object in the distance. This point of focus can never be meaningless, it is dexterously fixed on some definitive truth. Perhaps it is about the incoherent customary practices and rituals of India. Perhaps it is concern for the differences among the doctrinal systems of the heaps of śāstras. Perhaps it is the attempt to bind the entirety of the Āryan civilization under a singular set of iron rules. Perhaps it is a matter of a response to the inconceivable 
22Read between the lines and in essence what such models suggest is the old canard that India had no history—or even that Indians did not inhabit historical time in their self-conceptualizations—until the emergence of Indo- Persian historiography. 
16 
unity of the newly arrived rival religion [of Islam]—but this was a very distant matter. I have no doubt about it. The scholar for whom all of the śāstras were as if they rested in palm of his hand, before whose eyes Indian culture in its entirety was constantly being trampled—no effort of that great man could be entirely without purpose. 
If the entire Indian nation performs it observances during the same lunar day, breaks fast on the same day, eats and drinks at the same moment, then certainly it will be bound together on a single thread. That was the dream of Hemadri and his followers; indeed, it bore fruit. Today’s council is proof of that success. It is not now being decided whether the doctrine this universal almanac or some other one is valid, but it is going to be decided which single day—and one day only—the householders of all of India will perform their fast for the same reason. That is the importance of today’s council.23 
Standing out from the haze and gloom, with uncanny precision, Dvivedi directs our 
attention to the singular intellect of the great thirteenth-century Maharashtrian legalist 
polymath Hemādri Sūri. To be charitable, contained within the rather scanty representations 
presented by the rest of the secondary literature in both European and Indian languages, quite 
apart from his intellectual productions, there is some reoccurring vague notion of this dynamic 
historical figure’s extra-intellectual contributions to a wider lived reality. Should we set aside 
less credible perceptions in cultural memory of Hemādri as the quintessential Brāhmaṇical 
cultural hero, responsible for all matters of Maharashtra-specific cultural innovation from

17writing to farming to temple design,24 more sober voices acknowledge some sort of advisory 
role to at least two Hindu kings in the dynasty of Seuṇa Yādavas during the period when they 
controlled much of the western Deccan. Up until the coming of Islam ended their reign, this 
formidable cultural force, a strong and lavishly wealthy state that deeply involved itself in 
adjudicating the politics of culture, ruled out of Devgiri in an impenetrable fortress now in 
Aurangabad district. In the academic imagination, as a scholar, Hemādri is famously associated 
with the composition of a vast and basically unstudied dharmanibandha. Entitled the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi, though the study of its specific contents has been neglected, the work is 
widely perceived as the most comprehensive compendium outlining the practice of lived 
Indian religions, at least of the elite Smārta sort.25 
24For apocryphal representations of Hemādri as a cultural hero, see for example Sumit Guha, “Serving the Barbarian to Preserve the Dharma: The Ideology and Training of a Clerical Elite in Peninsular India c. 1300– 1800,” The Indian Economic & Social History Review 47, no. 4 (2010): 497–525. 25As will be discussed in some detail in chapter 9, the Caturvargacintāmaṇi has never in fact been printed in a complete form based on the surviving manuscript evidence, which is itself likely incomplete. The most complete vulgate edition of the text, which has been reprinted, often in partial form, remains the edition printed in the Bibliotheca Indica as volume 72. Bharatacandra Siromani, ed., Chaturvarga Chintámani (Calcutta: Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1871). A separate edition of the first volume of the Śrāddhakalpa making use of entirely different manuscript material has also been published. Vishwanath Shastri Bharadwaj, ed. Caturvargacintāmaniḥ (New Delhi: Siksavibhaga, Bharata Sarakara, 1971). 25It is an understatement to say that Hemādri has been ill served by both Western and Indian secondary literature, within which his work is almost exclusively discussed either in the service of mining his Purāṇic citations or with the intention of using the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s rājapraśasti (not included in our editions but printed separately by Bhandarkar) in the service of triangulating dynastic histories in the early medieval Deccan. The only full- length study dedicated to Hemādri in any language is Kesava Appa Padhye’s Marathi monograph Hemādri urpha Hemādpanta yāce Caritra, composed in 1931. Though a work of considerable erudition, for unlike everyone else he has clearly read Hemādri’s work at length and with care, it is afflicted by what to the modern Western reader seems an almost unimaginable credulousness on the part of its author. The opening sentence should be enough to give the interested reader a taste of what is at hand: “hemādripaṇḍitāsārakhā vidvān, vibhavaśālī, kīrttimān, dānaśūra, rājyakāryadharaṃdhara, sadācāranī va dharmābhimānī asā dusarā puruṣa pūrvīcyā kālāṃta jhālā nāhīṃ va puḍheṃ hoṇāra nāhī” (pt. 1, pg. 1). Succinctly, Padhye takes at face value everything ever said by or about Hemādri in sources ancient and modern. He also assigns to our subject a host of works that are clearly by other authors, resulting in a composite picture of Hemādri as an intellectual. More constructively, Padhye is privy to oral traditions concerning Hemādri that are apparently now lost, including a memory among certain artisan communities of a Hemādrīya Śilpaśāstra tradition. He also drawn upon a number of Mahānubhāvika sources, published and unpublished, both contemporary to the Seuṇa Yādavas and from subsequent centuries that offer representations, of varying reliability, of the Seuṇa court and Hemādri’s role within it. Another worthwhile resource is of course P.V. Kane’s History of Dharmaśāstra, which extensively mines Hemādri’s writings for references to older and lost traditions of dharma literature and makes extensive use of his archives of citations for doing text-critical source analysis. In his first volume, Kane (pg. 354–359) offers an encapsulated prosopographical treatment of our author along with a brief glimpse at his contributions, focusing mostly on his 
18 
Nevertheless, far more perceptively and specifically any of his other colleagues, 
Dvivedi stands out in signaling out the centrality of this storied figure’s contributions to the 
history of Hindu traditions. For Dvivedi proposes that alone of India’s religious authorities and 
scholars, Hemādri, witnessing the arrival of Islamic rule, saw truly and clearly “what was at 
stake.” On the cusp of early modernity, the need of the moment to was to create a new kind of 
unity of principle and purpose within Indic knowledge and culture such that, governed by a 
command of Pūrva Mīmāṃsā. P. V. Kane, History of Dharmaśāstra, 8 vols. (Pune: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1930–1962). 
Sadly, the remainder of our literature discussing Hemādri simply treats our author as an embodied instantiation of a perennial Brāhmaṇical worldview, often in a manner that directly conflicts with the theology in the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, without consulting his Sanskrit works. Emblematic of this trend is the usually exemplary G. Sontheimer, author of what was until recently the most substantial essay on Hemādri, who relies exclusively on the old Marathi sources of the Mahānubhavikas in representing his subject. Günther-Dietz Sontheimer, “God, Dharma and Society in the Yadava Kingdom of Devagiri According to the Lilacharitra of Chakradhara.” In Günther-Dietz Sontheimer: Essays on Religion, Literature, and Law, ed. Heidrum Brückner, et. al., (New Delhi: Manohar, 2004 [1982]), 305–326. Sontheimer’s model has been much expanded upon and refined to good effect in regard to the old Marathi sources in Christian Novetzke’s The Quotidian Revolution as well as in an additional essay composed for the Oxford History of Hinduism’s volume on Hindu law. Both of these works offer us vivid portraits of Hemādri as perceived by the Mahānubhāvika communities he persecuted. Novetzke, however, not being a Sanskritist, relies on Sontheimer’s characterization of Hemādri’s intellectual project, which alas is entirely uninformed by a study of his texts.

A similar issue is in evidence in Mary McGee’s monumental dissertation comparing the representation of vrata practice in the nibandha literature, especially vis-à-vis the role of women, with the author’s extensive fieldwork among Maharashtrian women performing vratas. McGee is the only author to date who has studied and translated extensive selections from the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, treating whole vrata cycles. However, her representation of the “nibandhakāra” theology of vrata, against which she contrasts the lived tradition, rests upon a synthetic composite “nibandha theology” that is produced out of an aggregate of her sources without attending to the specific theological positions and procedures of the individual works. In the case of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, in the absence of reading the opening portions of the Vratakhaṇḍa or its Paribhāṣā, she ascribes a theology of vrata to Hemādri that is in many regards antithetical to the one propounded in his text, which we will explore in the chapter 10.

Recent careful textual work, though restricted to the Dānakhaṇḍa of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, has been carried out by David Brick in the context of producing his edition of the Dānakāṇḍa of Lakṣmīdhara. Building upon earlier efforts, such as those of Trautmann, Florinda De Simini has added to our understanding by mapping out the subsequent reception of the text.

single iron rule, India and its people could face up to what was coming. This, so Dvivedi 
assumes, was the real intent of the aborted revolution in Hindu law, housed within the newly 
minted genre of the dharmanibandha and epitomized by the Caturvargacintāmaṇi. Hemādri 
saw the need to bring clarity to incoherent outmoded old customs, to look over the scriptures 
in all their difference and arrive at definitive lasting conclusions, and then to direct the people 
to translate this fresh understanding into clear and consistent action. From Dvivedi’s 
perspective, however, for all his genius, while Hemādri’s new synthesis was on the right track, 
it fell short of achieving its real intended goal, which was ultimately political or even proto- 
nationalist. Hemādri’s dream became successful; but the purpose was not fulfilled. India started its observances and its fasts during a single lunar measure; it was bound together to rise and to sit at the same moment, but it could not become unified. Its weakness was not restricted only to customary practices and rituals, this was only its external weakness. Its inner components were worn out by castes and subcastes, having become divided into thousands of religious traditions; its spiritual methods had become like a vessel with a hundred holes, without the (capacity) to hold (things in). . . . But it recovered just when it was about to drown. . . . from the distant south the thick heavy cloud bank of bhakti was visible. This cloud spread out over the Indian sky and it rained heavily for eight hundred years, washing away the rubbish [of that, typified by] uncountable Indian spiritual practices, and sowed innumerable seeds. India arose powerful with new enthusiasm and new splendor. It proclaimed with pride, its head held high. “Premaḥ smārtho mahān”: Love alone is the ultimate aim of man. Injunction and prohibition, śāstra and Purāṇa, rule and codes of conduct, ritual and spiritual method, above all of these is unerring love, great by its very nature. Love is above caste and class and stage of life; it transcends religious tradition.26

20 
Succinctly, from Dvivedi’s perspective, through the composition of his dharmanibandha, 
Hemādri sets out to tackle the problem of a lack of Indian unity, presupposed to form the 
necessary precondition for national greatness. Tragically, from Dvivedi’s perspective, the 
dharma tradition that succeeded Hemādri, fundamentally misunderstanding his intentions, 
turned around and provided a new kind of learned sanction legitimizing an almost debilitating 
degree of diversity. Thus, working within a Rankean paradigm of history writing, which sees 
the changing modes of textual production and the figures that produce the great works of a 
given historical moment as crystallizing the spirit of an age, giving expression to otherwise 
inchoate but nonetheless real collective sensibilities on the ground, Dvivedi proposes that as 
the life and integrity leaks out of the classical Indic episteme and those who embody it, faced 
with the failure of Hindu law, it is the new locus of devotional religion, and those who produce 
and perform it, that comes to encapsulate the spirit of the age, epitomizing “the real India.” 
However potentially communal we may find its polemical dimensions, to his credit, 
Hazari Prasad Dvivedi has just offered us a representation of Indian knowledge and religion 
that treats them as dynamic systems, possessing their own history, where knowledge practices 
are varied, informed by specific social circumstances, and subject to change. In many ways, 
the picture being painted is much more subtle, nuanced, and attentive to differing registers of 
expression and intellectual agendas within the domain of śāstra than the often static and 
programmatic presentations that until recently dominated so much of our own scholarly 
literature, particularly when it comes to representations of a perennial and unchanging 
“Brāhmaṇism” programmatically enforcing its frozen norms. If other parts of Dvivedi’s 
itinerary are oft incorrect and his history badly askew—and as we will see quite often, he is 
very wrong regarding matters both large and small—at least he is directing our attention 
21 
towards a multitude of neglected problematics and asking rather good questions, ones that the 
next two thousand pages set out to answer. 
Before attending to correcting Dvivedi’s errors, it is worth pausing for a moment to 
reflect upon where we might profit from some of his insights. For example, in lieu of viewing 
the realm of classical śāstra as a rule-driven activity whose hallmark is its conceptual divorce 
from engagement with empirical reality,27 Dvivedi, quite rightly, invokes the existence of a 
prevalent ancient tradition of Indian empiricism, rooted not in scriptural authority (āgama) but 
in reasoning (yukti), a dynamic we also will encounter in our struggle with the sources. Indeed, 
instead of viewing the deep past of Indic knowledge as defined by an intrinsic and all-pervasive 
hegemonic elite religiosity elevating scriptural authority above all else, that is increasingly 
eroded by the coming of a new critical rationality in early modernity, our usual Western 
emplotment of how cultures change over time, Dvivedi flips the narrative. The shift into the 
second millennium in his telling is marked instead by a flight from reason and “objectivity.” 
Just as we will discover, across disciplines and registers of expression, with the coming of the 
millennium, Indic knowledge and cultural production, particularly in the domain of 
Brāhmaṇical śāstra, became newly saturated with theistic religious concerns and modes of 
reasoning. Thus, for example, far from representing a perennial tradition uneasily encountering 
modernity, the paṇḍits attending Dvivedi’s pañcāyat inhabit a specifically early modern 
27Though the core position has a long prehistory in the secondary literature, this line of argumentation finds its most elegant interpreter in the writings of Sheldon Pollock, though it is worth noting that his perspective has changed over the decades such that by the time of the Sanskrit Knowledge Systems project, this line of inquiry has been largely abandoned. We will delve into this issue in much more detail in chapter 1. In the interim, see Sheldon Pollock, “The Theory of Practice and the Practice of Theory in Indian Intellectual History,” Journal of the American Oriental Society 105, no. 3 (1985): 499–519; Sheldon Pollock, “Mīmāṃsā and the Problem of History in Traditional India,” Journal of the American Oriental Society 109, no. 4 (1989): 603–11; Sheldon Pollock, “The Revelation of Tradition: Śruti, Smṛti, and the Sanskrit Discourse of Power,” in Boundaries, Dynamics And Construction of Traditions in South Asia, 2nd ed., ed.

22 
imaginary, deeply indebted as we shall see to Hemādri’s own contributions to the discourse, 
whose fundamental contours would have been as unthinkable and inexplicable to their 
“classical” Hindu predecessors as they are to Dvivedi himself. 
For Dvivedi, this theistic recasting of “objective” Brāhmaṇical knowledge in 
scripturalist terms proved to have a deleterious impact on the integrity of śāstra. This is 
especially true in the discipline of dharma, which retreats, as he sees it, into insipid proof- 
texting and the rote invocation of “religious” sources regarding all range of matters. At the 
same time, in his telling, this reimagining of sensibilities is also what makes possible the 
revolution of bhakti where “law gives way to love.” Thus, for Dvivedi, this new devotional 
ethos and cultural paradigm—enacted incidentally largely in the vernacular—accomplishes 
what Sanskrit scholarship, even in the realm of the law, ultimately could not. Across 
demographic and sectarian lines, for the first time in Indian history, there suddenly emerges a 
widely shared cultural framework for how a person should make sense of the world and imbue 
it with value. Instead of a static form whose core parameters were dictated in the ancient past 
within oblique “Vaidika” sources and then blandly replicated, perhaps with the occasional 
error, down into the present, in Dvivedi’s telling, Sanskritic knowledge—even Hinduism 
itself—has an inner life and liveliness of its own, marked as every life will be, by transitions 
and irrevocable changes. 
Dvivedi is equally prescient in directing his audience’s attention to the existence within 
śāstra in general, and in Dharmaśāstra in particular, of competing intellectual orientations, 
exemplified by the dichotomy between the programmatic metarules and the context-specific 
practice of place, which fundamentally amount to disparate visions about the nature and 
purpose of Indic knowledge, religion, and culture. In a sense, on the most basic level, what is 
23 
at stake is whether a scholar is engaged in a quest after universalizing truth (rendered always 
in the singular) or context- and agent-specific understanding. Is the nature of knowledge an 
inquiry after the “correct” answer? Then, after the hard work of discerning “what is right,” 
should we seek to apply this hard-won insight across a range of domains, substituting it in 
place of any other answers we might encounter? Is the work of the scholar to arrive at 
consilience, across disciplines and communities, bringing right understanding to spaces and 
communities where it is absent? Or, conversely, are the answers to many (if not most) questions 
likely to be inflected by perspective, tradition, and context such that most of our answers must 
always be qualified by thoughts of “who,” “where,” “under what circumstances,” “applying 
what principles,” and “to what ends?” Do we live in a world where “there are rules” and they 
always apply? Or, are our expectations—even the interpretive principles we bring to the 
table—contingent on the nature of specific social agents and the contents of their often very 
different life-worlds? What is more important? The discovery of the universal or the recovery 
of the particular? 
As the present work aims to make evident, these dichotomies are not merely archaic 
historical time pieces, nor are they the quaint or inscrutable preoccupations of an exotic Indic 
“other.” As participants in the twenty-first century, whether we like it or not, these are very 
much “our” problems. As academic scholars of religion embedded within neoliberal 
universities that increasingly are invested in the programmatic inculcation of particular visions 
of what knowledge and education are “for,” subject to the clarion call that scholarship must be 
“relevant,” these same deep contestations lie at the heart of our own academic imaginaries, 
fueling so much of our arguments about methodology and pedagogy. Just as we will find was 
so often the case in the early medieval Deccan, the immediate material reality that preceded 
24 
Hemādri’s interventions, which option one favors is closely correlated to the way one reads, 
makes use of and composes texts, and the broader contexts in which they are embedded. And 
how you answer such questions is largely determinative of what you think is most valuable or 
authentic both regarding the curation of internally diverse bodies of knowledge and how to 
evaluate, center, or cancel those who composed and made use of them. 
Just as pertinently for our purposes, to his considerable credit, until the Sanskrit 
Knowledge Systems Project, Hazari Prasad Dvivedi appears to be among the only scholars of 
his generation to have intuited that on the cusp of early modernity something radical and new 
is happening to the practice and animating purpose of Sanskritic “Brāhmaṇical” knowledge in 
general.28 Alone among existing scholarly perspectives, Dvivedi wisely chooses to center the 
sudden sea-change in values taking place within the discipline of Dharmaśāstra. Quite 
particularly, Dvivedi singles out the Maharashtrian Deśastha Brāhmaṇa Hemādri, author of the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi, and his “attempt to bind the entire Āryan Civilization under a singular 
set of iron-rules” as the most significant singular antecedent to the modern product of unifying 
Hinduism—of building a Hindu Nation animated by a shared big-tent theistic orthopraxy 
wherein managing authority is placed in the hands of the Brāhmaṇa legalist. As he recognizes, 
this project is at once political and exegetical, such that one cannot separate the management 
28In its own self-characterization, “The Sanskrit Knowledge Systems Project investigates the structural and social context of Sanskrit science and knowledge from 1550 to 1750. The period witnessed a flowering of scholarship lasting until the coming of colonialism, when a decline set in that ended the age-old power of Sanskrit thought to shape Indian intellectual history.” Nonetheless, as part of the process of contextualizing this particular moment in early modernity, many of the essays contributed by an array of scholars also address prehistories more relevant to our purposes: http://www.columbia/edu/itc/mealac/pollock/sks/index.html. An important, but alas as of yet unpublished contribution in this regard is a series of lectures delivered by Lawrence McCrea that make the case for the unprecedented theologization of Sanskrit śāstra after the tenth century. Lawrence McCrea, “Desecularization in Indian Intellectual Culture, 900–1300 AD,” in. Religion, Conflict, and Accommodation in Indian History, ed. Rajeev Bhargava and Sudipta Kaviraj (forthcoming). In the context of early modernity, this story has been subsequently specifically taken up in regard to the problematics of bhakti theology by Anand Venkatkrishnan, first in his dissertation and then in a number of publications. Anand Venkatkrishnan, Mīmāṃsā, Vedānta, and the Bhakti Movement (PhD diss., Columbia University, 2015).

of differentiated bodies and the redefinition of what constitutes governing authority from the 
curation of inherited textual and ritual resources and the building and revision of canons of 
texts and interpretive practices. This is a conclusion with which the present monograph wholly 
concurs. As we will see,29 demonstrated at some length in the closing chapters, with great 
erudition and originality, much as Dvivedi had intuited, Hemādri indeed articulates a new 
vision of Universalizing (sāmānya) dharma, wedded to a new kind of disciplinary power 
anchored in a self-consciously centralizing “Hindu” state. Integral to these efforts is the 
bestowing upon a new kind of Brāhmaṇa agent of a new program for professionalization, 
outlined, of course, in the writings of Hemādri himself. These grant the Brāhmaṇa legalist, 
regardless of his degree of erudition or participation within specific religious life-worlds, the 
capacity, rights, and duty to manage nearly every dimension of the quotidian religious lives of 
the vast majority of people in an unprecedented fashion. Indeed, it is this reimagining of the 
role of Dharmaśāstra as the site for general religious adjudication that forms the conditions of 
possibility to the events that Dvivedi outlines in “Paṇḍitoṃ kī Pañcāyat,” where the Brāhmaṇas 
of Kāśī gather together to determine on what single correct day all matter of Hindus must 
perform their festival, on an even grander scale. As will become apparent, though Dvivedi has 
failed to recognize these particulars, what makes this transformation itself possible are two 
core developments that overturn long existing consensuses. 
The first is the “colonization” of the Brāhmaṇa legalist’s own inherited modes of 
understanding and scholastic practice by a “popular,” theistic, and deeply devotionalized 
sensibility. It is this sea change in values that makes it essential that Dharmaśāstra, if it is to

26 
continue to be imagined as a “theology of everyday life,”30 must become thoroughly fused with 
extra-scholastic quotidian theology. It is this alteration that forever brings much of Sanskrit 
śāstra down out of the clouds, such that it becomes deeply entangled with the territory to which 
each scholar of Indian religions, whether their concerns are ancient or modern, ethnographic, 
political, philosophical, or hermeneutical in orientation would do well to attend, for the story 
we are telling has ramifications that permeate the present moment. The second dynamic, 
though utterly peripheral to Dvivedi’s understanding of Indian history, is that this new 
Brāhmaṇical fervently theistic vision sets out to forcibly impose itself, not upon a largely 
empty space occasionally punctuated by Sanskrit dictums and idle philosophical speculation, 
but within an already extant landscape, inflected by a different knowledge system and thickly 
30This phrase adapts a concept masterfully articulated by Donald Davis, the “theology of ordinary life,” in his reconstruction of what it is like to inhabit and think inside Dharmaśāstra as a knowledge system from the “ordinary” perspective of a twice-born householder. Towards this end, Davis offers us a tour of such topics as how one should read and interpret law, the problem of “debt,” emic conceptualizations of personhood and property, conflict mediation and legal disputes, and punishment and rehabilitation. As Davis writes: “Law is the theology of ordinary life. It is both the instrument and the rhetoric by which the most familiar, repeated, and quotidian of human acts are first placed in a system or structure larger than individual experience. Law thus provides the initial movement toward a transcendence of personal consciousness and meaning that makes possible the higher order coordination of human activity, the vision of meaning in life abstracted, and the achievement of ethical, social, political, economic, and religious goods. Law, or rules if you prefer for now, are a key part of every child’s socialization into a family, a school, or a team. The communal rules to which we subject our children and ourselves impart meaning and purpose to the collective of which we become a part. As the scope and scale of such rules increase to approach the level more commonly understood as law, the sense of achievement, good, and transcendence provided by the law becomes more abstract and distant. Nevertheless, at every level, the plurality of laws by which we lead our lives encode assumptions and ideas about what we aspire to as human beings and what we presume about ourselves and others. Those assumptions, ideas, and presuppositions I call theology, and they pertain to ordinary life, things near to us like family, birth, death, sex, money, marriage, and work – all common themes in the law.” Donald Davis, The Spirit of Hindu Law (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010), 1. 
In recasting Davis’s definition from the “ordinary” to “the everyday,” the objective is to refine and expand his model to incorporate a further dimension of transactional lived experience on the Indian subcontinent, namely, the principles and rules that govern how one thinks about and transacts with deities and spirits. For the average inhabitant of the Indian subcontinent, throughout much of Indian history, having a working model for engaging in such matters, which we modern readers are much less inclined to view as ordinary, was very much a part of everyday life. Just as in the modern West the incorporation of a much more culturally and religiously heterogenous immigrant population has put pressure on the Anglo-American tradition of jurisprudence to adequately acknowledge and incorporate new problematics, so too as the system we call “Hindu” law expands, its intended demographic reach and depth of purview on the cusp of early modernity, it also must render itself capable of accommodating and becoming mutually legible to the value systems of “new” and prevalent sorts of participants. 
27populated by social and religious institutions with their own approaches to the curation and 
management of religious imaginaries. 
As we have just seen, Dwiviedi’s larger metanarrative accounts for this shift in 
sensibilities by proposing a historical periodization of knowledge practices and cultural ethos. 
Just as during the past millennium Indian knowledge in general became more pervasively 
“religious” in nature, among learned people, discourse in general became more “contingent 
and dependent on context.” In directing us to attend to the reality that the core problematic that 
this clash of sensibilities between the universalizing and the particular—which in the study of 
Indian religions has been generally perceived as essentially a demographically constituted 
artifact of the conflict between the “great” and “little” traditions—was already contained 
within the “Brāhmaṇical” “great tradition” of Dharmaśāstra itself, Dvivedi has been of 
invaluable assistance and we would do well to build upon his insights.31 The same cannot be 
said concerning his attempt at historicizing these developments, which merely recapitulate a 
common political narrative of his day. Dvivedi proposes that these two seemingly disparate 
developments—learned discourse becoming pervasively “religious” in nature, and learned 
discourse becoming preoccupied by the “contingent” and dependent on “context”—are the 
products of the same external cause, namely, the incursion of an “alien” cultural system into 
31Though the notion of “great and little traditions” first emerges from Robert Redfield’s fieldwork among the indigenous peoples of Mexico and the American Southwest, this framing’s entrance into the study of Indian religions is largely the contribution of Milton Singer and McKim Marriott. While in its initial phase, the model seems to have proposed a complementary bifurcation of research programs, such that humanists who study texts were called upon to study the “great” learned traditions of Indian society, while anthropologists were encouraged to study “the little traditions” of lived Indian religions at the level of the individual village, with the hope that the coordination of efforts would lead to greater understanding, in practice what emerged were lasting ideological and methodological divisions to the detriment of the discipline with the two categories becoming reified. The conflict is essentially between textualists, focused on elite Sanskrit sources, who see the textual production of certain demographically limited communities as “the real Indian religion,” and a fieldwork-grounded perspective that sees in those same sources an ideological fantasy utterly divorced from quotidian lived realities. The recognition, already present in McKim Marriott’s work, that in fact these two domains seem often in practice to be mutually co-constitutive, has sadly fallen on largely deaf ears. 
28 
the subcontinent. Initially, this force is Islam, and eventually a parallel role is attributed to 
colonial Christianity. In either case, it is the introduction of new and lasting external social 
circumstances, animated by “alien” values that bring about new ways of being and believing, 
necessarily reshaping religious cultures and interpretive practices. Lurking under the surface 
of such presuppositions, though to be fair to Dvivedi his own articulation of this position is 
much more nuanced, is an implication that there is something invalid, or at least suspect, about 
these adaptations to the impositions of the external “other,” and that they represent a 
“deviation” from imagined and essentialized “civilizational norms.” Within such a frame, 
cross-cultural encounter and everything it allegedly engenders is at once a tragedy and a 
political problem. 
A Crack in our Historiography as Vast as an Ocean: The Forgotten Pluralism of the 
Early Medieval 
As the present work will make plain, quite apart from its questionable polemical implications, 
a preponderance of evidence from the archive originating in a range of disciplines renders key 
elements of Dvivedi’s historiographical metanarrative that posits cross civilizational encounter 
as the core catalyst for the internal diversification of Brāhmaṇism as a knowledge system 
highly anachronistic and thoroughly implausible. Instead, as we will rapidly discover in our 
own investigations, disparate visions about the nature and purpose of Indic knowledge32 and 
32Indic knowledge is a formulation somewhat akin to “Abrahamic religions” in that it can refer to a specific complex of genealogical ties between bodies of knowledge and praxis across the boundaries of distinct religions but can also be deployed in the service of making political arguments about the “indigeneity” of traditions vis-à- vis excluded others and/or homogenizing a range of religions with the aim of subordinating them to a single dominant strain. Its use throughout this work is intended only to invoke the conceptual and intertextual ties that exist among imaginaries with significant shared roots stemming from Sanskrit and Prakrit literary, philosophical, cultural, and exegetical canons and norms (even when they are arrived at through mediation of vernaculars). From this perspective, for example, where vernacular and Persian textual traditions substantively engage with and respond to concepts and frames associated with these genealogies, as happens quite often, for example, among Qadiri communities in the western Deccan, they are also participating in Indic knowledge systems. In contrast, 
29 
culture, one privileging a prescriptive search for definitive answers and the other what we 
might label a kind of contextualism that elevates the practices of place, are present within the 
Indic knowledge systems, especially the domain of Dharmaśāstra, virtually from the moment 
of their inception in our textual record. Indeed, the governing conceit of the present work is 
that much of the history of Sanskrit and vernacular knowledge and Indian religions can be seen 
as playing out within a field that is largely constituted of the ongoing contestations and 
negotiations between these two perspectives as they unfold within historical time. In fact, as 
we will see, in violation of our expectations that ahistorically essentialize Sanskrit knowledge 
and Indian religions as rigid, programmatically doctrine driven, and unchanging, the voice of 
our archives overwhelmingly confirms that throughout the early medieval period, traditions of 
both epistemological and legal pluralism very much had the upper hand, and not just in some 
abstract intellectual domain, but out in the real world in a manner that directly impacted a 
myriad of human lives. The erasure of this empirical reality forms an integral part of the story 
of how dharma was universalized. 
Unfortunate ideological commitments aside, a major culprit here is the emaciatedly 
“thin description” Dvivedi offers us of the “pre-Islamic” Hindu past, which intrinsically 
presents us with methodological problems. In the absence of a richer rendering of its governing 
dynamics, contours, and conceptual content, it is virtually impossible to accurately identify 
innovation or change. We will mistake what is new to us for what is “new” and then fill in the 
rest of the picture with the findings of our predecessors, presuming that whatever assumptions 
we have inherited are the products of careful inquiry, sound judgement, and comprehensive 
reading. As we will discover in great detail, when it comes to the study of the Indian early 
forms of popular modern Hinduism that think almost exclusively inside of protestant and neoliberal frames can be plausibly excluded from reflections about Indic traditions. 
30 
medieval, especially in regard to the western Deccan, in the very spaces where Hemādri’s 
juridical religious revolution made their most palpable and immediate impact, none of these 
assumptions hold true. When we start from a sky filled with “nanus” and label it our context, 
our scholarly edifices are inevitably built upon foundations of sand. 
No mere product of the particular genre limitations of essay writing in which Dvivedi 
is participating, this impoverished imagination regarding the very pre-Islamic “Hindu” past 
that the author seeks to extol and valorize is a conspicuous, almost constitutive feature of the 
writings of many of his nationalist contemporaries.33 Beyond its sad ramifications for the future 
of the Indian nation in which a fetishized past becomes ever the more valorized almost in 
inverse proportion to its particulars being understood, as was suggested before, this vacuity of 
perception in regard to the pre-Islamic past makes it exceedingly difficult to think meaningfully 
about historical change, particularly when said change entailed intensive and deliberate 
institutional disruption. To be blunt, if you do not have a working knowledge of very basic 
questions such “what was there before,” “how did it work,” along with “what types of social 
agents inhabited the domains under study,” any efforts to understand in particularized terms 
the impact of a specific social, cultural, and religious revolution will be fruitless. You have too 
little evidence and too many variables. You might as well be trying to reconstruct “what was 
33A perfect example is found in the legacy of the public intellectual Kanaiyalal Munshi. As the founder of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan at the direction of Mahatma Gandhi, Munshi was markedly responsible for the preservation of Indian cultures past, present, and future and was instrumental in the propagation of “Bhāratīya Saṃskṛti” as a national value. Nevertheless, a reader who turns to Munshi’s own historical fiction, whether set in the Solaṅkī Cālukya court at Patan in Gujarat or depicting the sack of Somanātha, both near neighbors to Hemādri’s Seuṇa Yādava imperium, is likely to come away largely bereft of any sense of early medieval India as having a social reality or sensibility that is not directly indebted to the distinctly Anglo-Saxon romances of Sir Walter Scott. In Munshi’s writings, to be blunt, apart from the names of the characters, there is very little that is recognizably Indian about the sociality or practice at the Cālukya court let alone about the narrative in which it is embedded.

Dresden like in the nineteenth century” based on the city’s modern infrastructure, architecture 
and demography, without any awareness of the impact or even existence of something called 
WWII or of the discontinuities between the flow of people, goods, and services in the modern 
globalized world and what took place in a slower and much more markedly White age of 
imperialism. And while such a conceptual project might call for extraordinary ingenuity on the 
part of the scholar undertaking it, and maybe even arrive offhandedly at some reasonable 
working insights, no dissertation committee would ever encourage its undertaking and no 
publisher of repute would be interested in its findings, for the very simple reason that there 
exist copious archival evidence, from images, to literary representations, to documentary 
records, to eye-witness testimonies that render such an endeavor irrelevant, even ill-conceived. 
Succinctly, to tell any reasonable specific story about Dresden and those who have inhabited 
it, at a bare minimum, the expectation is that a decent scholar will not simply conflate its varied 
historical pasts with its present. They will incorporate a range of types of evidence into their 
analysis and through a curated presentation of excerpts from primary sources, they will aim at 
giving the reader access to the varied life-worlds and self-understandings of specific historical 
agents. Just as importantly, they will identity and elucidate major epochal events that shaped 
their subject of study, paying special attention say, to the fire-bombing that levelled so much 
of the city. 
In a similar manner, when we presume out of hand the absence of the possibility of a 
thick rendering of particularized and multidimensional social, conceptual, and institutional 
contexts, the scholar of premodern India faces a similar conundrum. We are pretty much34 left 
34The other somewhat viable alternative, which has seen some success, is to apply the methods of Begriffsgesichte and reconstruct transitions in the history of Indian ideas and religious doctrines through offering semantic histories of changing usages and scopes of application of specific words. The problem with this approach is that not only is Sanskrit an unusually polyvalent language, but within śāstra and kāvya, the repeated use of the same words 
32 
to choose between anchoring our awareness in two equally unsatisfactory options, selecting 
between what one might call “a discourse of kingdoms without contents” or a “sky full of 
nanus.” On the one hand, we can call ourselves “historians,” antagonistically distancing 
ourselves from “essentializing” scholars of religion and the programmatic delusions of 
textualist prescriptivism, and privilege “kingdoms without contents.” In the typical reception 
of a purely documentary account of Indian history driven by inscriptions, historical change is 
recovered through the meticulous documentation either of dynastic transitions or of 
reoccurring periodized lexical changes in the archive. These are then seen as indexing shifts in 
social structure and the changing roles of specific types of social agents. Within such a frame, 
the subjects we label “religion” are treated as simply one kind of indexable data among many, 
of interest only in so much as it can be correlated with changes in institutional structures and 
questions of which communities hold agency. 
The great contribution of this sort of work is that it attunes us to the various quotidian 
realities that were constitutive of the lived experience of the vast majority of the population of 
the subcontinent, and yet are largely elided from so much of our prescriptive textuality. Such 
scholarship is also adept at introducing us to an India inhabited by a multiplicity of different 
types of social agents, extending far beyond the limited purview of learned scholastic traditions 
typically produced by and for less than one percent of the population. And yet, in the absence 
of textually mediated access to the competing emic conceptualizations of how these structures 
and life-worlds shaped the self-understandings and horizons of possibility of those who 
with the same sense is in fact considered a rhetorical flaw. It is thus the norm in many domains to use a network of synonyms or even distinct collocations to refer to the same concept. Moreover, the contestation of the meaning and scope of application of specific lexemes, that is to say that the same word can and frequently does mean totally different things to different communities and that these adjustments are themselves the site of sectarian exchange, lies at the heart of much of Sanskrit commentary and apologetics. Simply tracking a single lexeme is thus a necessary but not sufficient approach to semantic historical mapping. 
33 
inhabited them, such as those provided by biography or autobiography for example, the 
genuinely informative patterned representations that emerge out of such work are rarely 
allowed to speak for themselves. Instead, these discursive regularities tend to be correlated 
with the presentist ideological and political preoccupations of the scholar undertaking the 
investigation. In short, we document very real patterns of transformation shorn of any capacity 
to make sense of how these transformations would have impacted or been understood by the 
very people who were subjected to them. 
The other option often resorted to, especially by scholars who self-identify primarily 
as Sanskritists, is to wholeheartedly embrace what Dvivedi calls a “sky full of nanus.” This is 
to say, the scholar presumes that the only premodern “interpretive context” that can be 
meaningfully recovered is the capacious intertextual exchanges we can reconstruct through a 
close reading of points of overlap across different textual sources, almost exclusively 
composed in Sanskrit.35 Here historical change is indexed through looking at patterns of textual 
borrowing and influence, direct inter-referentiality, and through periodizing the appearance of 
new topoi and imagery. Depending on which academic demographic is undertaking this kind 
35The most sophisticated and widely influential articulation of this perspective was offered by the historian of political philosophy Quentin Skinner. Its point of origin is usually attributed to his 1969 essay “Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas,” with important refinements being offered by J. Pocock. The so-called Cambridge school of “linguistic contextualism,” which has become a mainstay of the history of ideas, asserts that the proper context for making sense of the intentions of political thinkers is at the level of intertextuality, through the recovery of the strategic choices that authors make in response to each other’s writings, and not through efforts to derive a unitary understanding of the dogma or “position” of a given author or school of thought based on the synthetic reading of a corpus of works as if they express a single intention. Quentin Skinner, “Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas,” History and Theory 8, no. 1 (1969): 3–53. The direct importation of this approach into the study of India, where it has become a mainstay of scholars of Indian intellectual history can be attributed to Jonardon Ganeri and his 2008 article: Jonardon Ganeri, “Contextualism in the Study of Indian Intellectual Cultures.,” Journal of Indian Philosophy 36, no. 5/6) (2008): 551–562. From a deeper historical perspective, however, Skinner’s own thinking on these matters bears an uncanny resemblance to debates about hermeneutics within German scholastic circles going back as far as the eighteenth century that played a pivotal role in the emergence of history writing as a methodologically self-conscious discipline. For a brilliant contextualization of these matters along with an insightful account of the epistemological foundations of evidence-driven historical research, see Frederick C. Beiser, The German Historicist Tradition (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015).

of work, at the end of the day with this kind of work, the “only India” to which the modern 
scholar has deep access is either from the perspective of a largely male Brāhmaṇa world 
comprised of extremely learned śāstric argumentation or from the anonymized but nonetheless 
equally interdependent realms of clashing canons of revealed scripture offering a view from 
nowhere. Here the presumption is that since particularized social realities are effectively 
unrecoverable, the contextualization of the interplay between specific sources entails situating 
it in relation to the ideological background out of which specific speech acts emerge. In 
practice what this means is that beyond the intellectual or theological content of specific 
scholastic discourses, the history of Indian ideas is represented as a repeating series of moments 
in which a purportedly hegemonic Brāhmaṇical thought seeks to legitimate itself and 
normalize its social program against the challenges posed by some under specified “others,” 
most of whose voices are presumed unrecoverable. 
At its best, albeit in the realm of often abstruse philosophical arguments, such textualist 
scholarship also attends with great care to questions of technique. This is to say, this mode of 
analysis does not merely see its intended purpose as the recovery of the particular doctrinal 
and philosophical conclusions arrived at by a given author followed by a reflection on the 
wider “ends” these positions serve. It is just as invested in a step-by-step reconstruction of the 
methods of argumentation, exegetical moves, and rhetorical strategies, along with the deep 
history of these practices, that in situ served as the preconditions for rendering meaningful and 
tenable what we all too often treat as free-floating dogmas.36 In other words, it offers us a 
36For a fine recent example of such work, focusing on the debate about whether the beginning or ending of a work of śāstra is determinative of its meaning, which in the process of reconstructing a specific history inculcates a mode of reasoning into the reader so they can follow the intermural exchanges, see: Lawrence McCrea and Yigal 
35 
model for understanding not just “why” texts were written, but “how” they get written, or even 
of their assemblage. It is this shift from an overwhelming preoccupation with questions of 
“why” to questions of “how” that holds considerable constructive implications for our own 
study. Essentially, so that we can understand these choices on their own terms, the necessary 
precondition for following a logical argument within philosophy from start to finish, the 
modern reader of these highly technical modes of scholarship is necessarily subjected to a 
pedagogical mode that deliberately inculcates into them a new mode of reasoning that has as 
its intended purpose learning how to think alongside our subjects. This includes cultivating a 
working awareness of the previously alien parameters already presumed by the discourse under 
study. To learn just one thing well, we are required to acclimate ourselves to many of the 
conventions governing the standard sets of choices, the repertoire of idiom and rhetorical 
moves that would have been self-evident parts of the tool kit of any intended reader and that 
they themselves would have acquired, not from being born into a culture, but from having them 
instilled into them within a specific institutional context. In other words, the process of 
producing serious scholarship on Indian śāstra almost inadvertently recapitulates parts of the 
mimetic mode of learned consciousness that made a prospective student into a śāstrin in the 
first place. 
Here, then, is the important take away point. What such scholarship demonstrates is 
that within a circumscribed domain governed by specific rules, whatever a person’s original 
background, using the emic tools acquired through the recapitulation of a semblance of a 
traditional mode of study, one can learn to think and make decisions “inside” someone else’s 
system. Essentially, this is possible because what is happening is we are becoming aware of 
Bronner, First Words, Last Words: New Theories for Reading Old Texts in Sixteenth-Century India (New York: Oxford University Press, 2021). 
36 
and implicated in some of the very same pedagogical strategies that shaped the social agents 
we study. Moreover, such a project is not merely a matter of cultivating some nebulous 
sympathy or having unverifiable off-the-book special experiences, the usual criticisms made 
of the importation of “emic” elements into the study of religion.37 It is viable for precisely the 
same reasons that we each have some capacity, however more or less poorly, to take up, if not 
master, flamenco or ballroom dancing, namely, that the acquisition of such skills is a product 
of a repeatable pedagogical process complemented by varying degrees of “native” talent. Just 
as a course of study in music or film appreciation will forever change what you hear or see 
when listening to a string quartet or watching a New Wave film, without enabling let alone 
requiring you to play the Nocturnes or become Antonioni, even in the absence of great skill 
and personal mastery, merely being acclimated to recognize the same shared canon of 
reference internalized by connoisseurs, their specific technical choices, and their underlying 
methodological and material constraints changes how a scholar reads and relates to their source 
material. Perhaps most significantly, because these skills are modular in nature, in the same way 
that discrete traditional dance moves can be productively transposed into new settings once 
they have been acquired, it is possible to deploy these “modes of reasoning” in the service of 
ends that fall outside their original intended field of application. Succinctly, by understanding 
some of the rules and parameters people use to assemble their texts, we are not just becoming 
third rate Sanskrit pandits. With such capacities in hand, it becomes possible to take as our 
focus of study not determining the proper understanding of one specific source against another, 
37For a particularly well-articulated version of such a critique, see for example Russell T. McCutcheon, A Modest Proposal on Method: Essaying the Study of Religion (Leiden: Brill, 2017). 
37but engaging in a concentrated reflection on the assemblage process itself through which they 
produced the cultural documents (written or otherwise) that form our usual focus of study. And 
by looking deliberately at how things get made, how a specific agent manages and curates 
inherited textual and exegetical archives, we gain privileged access to discrete and recoverable 
examples of historical change as they unfold at the microtextual level. 
Such an approach, akin to Skinnerian contextualism, has until now been largely 
confined either to the study of Indian philosophy, especially in its most rarefied forms, or to 
text critical work that is invested in producing the critical apparatus that accompany critical 
editions of intrinsically interreferential scriptural works, such as Tantras. Over the next 
thousand pages, the present work aims to demonstrate the utility of a broader range of 
applications of parallel modes of analysis, that center questions of process, professionalization, 
and pedagogy in the service of using emic frames to think historically about the changing ways 
that different forms of knowledge get put together and their wider impacts on society. The 
logical extension of such an approach from a purely intellectual domain to the realms of law 
and ritual, where we approach discrete historical questions only after first grounding ourselves 
in discipline specific modes of reasoning, is almost self-evident. Right away, by recasting a 
story about ultimate aims—about why x was done from the wider cultural perspective—into 
one substantively about method—how x got done—and attending to some of the specific types 
of deliberative choices integral to the daily lived practices of the social agents we are studying, 
we have already arrived at an avenue of inquiry that enables us to make sense, as Dvivedi for 
all his erudition could not, of the deliberative efforts undertaken by a council of Dharmaśāstrins 
as a form of meaningful labor with concrete real-world consequences. 
38 
Instead of merely dismissing their actions as irrational and inscrutable acts of “digging 
a mouse out of a mountain of citations,” by the time this work concludes, you the reader will 
have learned to reason like those pandits (along with many other types of social agents) while 
at the same time recognizing, as they themselves would not have, some of the contingent 
conditions of possibility and particular longue durée histories that made their life-world 
possible and meaningful. In this way, at least some facets of the self-understanding of the social 
agents whose individuated choices and life-worlds we are exploring become meaningfully 
incorporated into our analysis without necessarily becoming its point of termination. 
And as we will soon discover, there is ample ability to extend such a method 
analogically, not just from high scholastic production to more applied disciplines like ritual 
and law, but to thinking with and about documentary records as well as material culture as it 
is embedded in lived space. With slight adjustments, each domain can be treated as the products 
of the application of parallel learned techniques enacted within a specific matrix of 
expectations and inherited constraints that shaped what could and should be done, expectations 
that we can again witness as they change over time. By recovering a range of parallel 
instantiations of the same types of deliberative processes, whether prescriptive, documentary, 
or enacted in material culture and then periodizing the discrete moments, institutional contexts, 
and circumstances at which they unfold within historical time, we improve our chances of 
recognizing key moments of historical change and recovering deliberate and self-conscious 
intellectual, methodological, and theological innovation. From a broader perspective, because, 
as we have observed, changes in decision-making processes are ultimately quite often really 
“about” changes in values, such a project in the end is not merely a dusty exercise in the 
archeology of someone else’s knowledge. It is a participant in broader global conversations, 
39 
past and present, about what it means to be a human being skillfully navigating a specific social 
world. Indeed, such an approach represent a return to foundational ideas of our own traditions 
of pedagogy, which saw we now call the “liberal arts,” not in terms of a division into 
disciplines, but as ars liberalis, the skilled techniques and practices acquired by autonomous 
agents. As should by now be plain, this work champions an unapologetically humanistic 
approach to the study of religion in pre-colonial South Asia, one that takes equally seriously 
the labor and skill entailed in making of theological speculation, scholarly reflection, 
prescriptive manuals, bills of sale, the shaping of icons, and the management and reform of 
institutions. Instead of either privileging or denigrating the “big aspirational ideas” or arcane 
theological formulations vis-à-vis more quotidian or allegedly authentic facets of broader 
culture, throughout this work they are each placed on a level playing field. By attending to 
moments of conceptual and rhetorical overlap or pointed contention between disparate 
domains and media, where markedly different disciplines and agents seem to be talking about, 
claiming, or ascribing meaning to “the same thing,” we grope our way in the dark towards 
something like moments of recognition of a shared interpretive context inhabited by a range of 
social actors drawn from across the spectrum of social possibility. Though such a project bears 
a family resemblance to certain Indological investigations, it diverges from them by 
decentering, without devaluing, the life-world of Brāhmaṇical scholasticism, whose intriguing 
parts have been mistaken for a unified and totalizing Indic whole. What emerges out of such a 
more nuanced endeavor is the recovery of a rich pluralistic tableau of interrelated life-worlds, 
inhabited by discrete kinds of social agents, enlivened by diverse values, norms, and 
presuppositions and expressed in a range of languages and linguistic and visual and registers. 
40 
We arrive at this sort nuanced understanding, not merely limiting ourselves to 
corroborating or discrediting what one finds in a reified prescriptive Brāhmaṇical literature, 
when each of these discrete activities is understood on its own terms as a form of highly skilled 
artisanal activity with its own presupposed inherited canon of topic and technique that 
demanded to be mastered. At the same time, we also must acknowledge the varying, and 
sometimes quite disconcerting—even appalling—social impacts of the reception of particular 
productions as they go into wider circulation. Succinctly, as we will experience in chapter 2, 
one can appreciate the rhetoric and attend to the skilled poetic labor that went into the crafting 
of a bill of sale—even benefit from what such an object tells us about medieval institutional 
cultures—at the very same time one bears witness to the hideous reality that it is a human being 
that is being sold. Precisely because the remote past is a foreign country in which virtually no 
modern reader, whatever their ethnicity or nationality, would, in actuality, feel remotely 
comfortable were they to be subject to its strictures and constraints, such an approach is perhaps 
the inevitable outcome of any attempt at recovering lived religion in all of its messiness that 
charts a course set apart from either nativist triumphalism or condemnatory political polemic. 
Since the advent of Religionswissenschaft as a form of disciplinarity in the nineteenth 
century, even among those invested in questions of hermeneutics and ultimate meaning such 
as Schleiermacher,38 its most responsible practitioners have repeatedly affirmed the 
indispensability of seeking to situate, as much as the archive allows, the most rarefied forms 
of theological expression within the specific social, political, and institutional contexts that 
made possible its articulation and transmission. It is thus all the more disconcerting that, with 
38See Thomas E. Reynolds, “Religion Within the Limits of History: Schleiermacher and Religion—A Reappraisal.” Religion 32, no. 1 (2002): 51–70. 
41 
rare exceptions, well into the twenty-first century, the academic study of South Asian religions 
prior to the Islamic encounter typically eschews serious consideration of how on-the-ground 
premodern legal and institutional realities—treated not as heady or offensive ideological 
abstractions but concrete localized norms with disciplinary dimensions—shape, inflect, and 
make possible particular modes of religious behavior and knowledge production. In place of 
robust social histories that study “how,” and not just “towards what ends” specific social spaces 
are governed and according to which norms, we have instead been offered simplified stories 
of subjugation and resistance or accounts of ideologies largely existing outside of history that 
somehow shape the fates of men. When we approach the archive already armed with reified 
notions of “Sanskrit ideology,” “feudal society,” “Hindu kings,” “theistic religion” or 
“Brāhmaṇical normativity,” we project onto our sources a stagnancy and uniform flatness they 
do not possess, which renders both any serious consideration of these internally diversified 
life-worlds as meaningful on their own terms as well as any particularized historical thinking 
about how they came to be constituted largely impossible. In this regard we are worse off than 
Hazari Prasad Dvivedi, who at least was acutely aware of the internal ideological and 
methodological diversification of the types of categories, such as Brāhmaṇical authority, we 
tend to reify, and attuned to the possibility that core values and perspectives that defined 
particular experiences of being Indic or being Brāhmaṇa had been subject to repeated change 
within historical time in response to external circumstances. 
As a much needed corrective, in the service of richly rendering particularized lived 
religious life-worlds as at once overbrimming with meaning for those who participated in them 
and at the same time historically contingent and perhaps effaceable over the longue durée of 
Indian history, a central aim of the current study is to redirect the student of Indian religions to 
42 
begin developing a better understanding of the working mechanics of some of the key juridical 
norms and social institutions, reflected across a surprising range of prescriptive, scholastic, and 
documentary sources, that animated and organized the life-worlds of the early medieval world 
in general and the Deccan in particular. Beyond their intrinsic interest, attending to these 
integral dimensions of early medieval imaginaries will prove absolutely integral to 
reconstructing how in concrete and discrete ways the interpretive project of the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi sets out to engineer their mitigation or nullification in the service of new 
kinds of programmatic governmentality. 
Succinctly, if, as scholars of religion, we actually want to talk about multidimensional 
lived social realities and not just indulge ourselves in partial idealized fantasies, when such 
concerns surface in our archives, we are going to have to grapple with the specific laws and 
punishments to which different types of social agents were subject and with whom the 
authority to adjudicate was vested. We need to be aware of how and where the people we 
studied paid their taxes or what was involved as they navigated reams of transactional 
paperwork and the bureaucracies that produced it. When we look at impressive and imposing 
buildings or material culture we now appreciate for its aesthetic value, we ought to inquire not 
just who paid for it and how, but about the people who did the actual labor and what we can 
glean of their own self-understanding of the output we now admire. If we are going to talk 
about inequity or disciplinary power, we need to attend to patterns of property holding and 
wealth as they are directly reflected in our particular sources along with who has the power to 
punish, chastise, and kill and according to what norms. If we are going to talk about the 
strategic instrumentality, as opposed to ascribing blind dogmatic adherence, of specific social 
agents, we should seek out a sense of some of the challenges and opportunities native to 
43 
distinctive premodern tracks for professionalization that held out the promise of the acquisition 
of power. We might consider, where sources permit, how political authorities weigh their 
options and cultivate constituencies with different values when making difficult decisions or 
how religious authorities balanced the competing demands and duties imposed upon by them 
by different facets of their professional and personal lives. Finally, and perhaps most 
consequently, because no “social type” is an island unto itself, we have to seek out what shared 
contexts, conceptual as well as institutional, brought together the internally diversified 
demographics of social agents whose life-worlds we have been studying within shared frames 
that made possible coordinated effort in the service of common aims or values. Such 
considerations, it will be suggested, can lead us to refining more broadly our rather unnuanced 
representations of premodern Indian sociality as expressions of either a millennium of 
hegemonic dominance or patterned resistance, in the service of becoming better readers and 
interpreters of religious realities, imagined and actual inhabited by a range of differentiated 
social agents. As this work seeks to demonstrate, instead of the current fixation on taking as 
our point of departure generalized schemata about social structure or social systems, such 
particularized considerations and attention to institutional histories often form a more logical 
point of departure for telling coherent and contained stories about South Asian religious pasts. 
As the move towards social history laden with sociological presumptions often plays 
out, or is perceived, as stalking horse for a project of materialist reductionism, whereby the 
West peels back the veil of emic ideological illusions and imposes its values and strategic 
rationality onto the Global South’s past with the aim of shaping its future, its vital to recognize 
that the present study has markedly different intellectual ambitions. It not merely asserts but 
models a mode of scholarship that consistently takes as its primary points of dialogical 
44 
departure conceptualizations, problematics, and institutions emerging from Indian archives 
and the labor of premodern Indian thinkers as well as Indian colonial interpreters and modern 
products of the Indian academy. Each of these it endeavors to treat as subjects whose internal 
mode of reasoning and concerns pose real questions that demand to be grappled with, not as 
objects or data providing grist for some already in-hand academic mill. As an earnest 
expression of this at once methodological and ethical choice, the present work is framed as an 
elaborate point by point response to the discrete arguments, intellectual agenda, and core 
problematics expressed by Hazari Prasad Dvivedi’s in his Hindi essay Paṇḍitoṃ kī Pañcāyat. 
It is a testament to the richness of the discourse Dvivedi has produced that crafting an adequate 
reply to his own speculative inquires grounded in a careful consideration of a range of relevant 
archives demanded a two-thousand-page rejoinder to a six-page essay. 
Contrary to the widely disseminated presumption within the academic study of religion 
that taking seriously emic frames and emic problematics simply means that we inscribe an 
emic constructive theological agenda in a manner that potentially compromises the integrity of 
a “secular” humanist academy, this dissertation should make abundantly clear that one can 
think with and alongside emic frames articulated by non-Western, premodern, and 
contemporary religious agents without simply reifying their conclusions or engaging in 
someone else’s apologetics. In part, what such assumptions have failed to recognize is that 
wherever the production of religious meaning and making of religious life-worlds is being 
undertaken by different types of social agents, a dynamic that I consider a defining feature of 
the history of religion in South Asia, “emic frames” within our archives are already pluralized, 
problematized, and contested, albeit often in terms of points of contention markedly different 
than those that preoccupy our own sensibilities. When we take these frames seriously, we also 
45 
discover that they were constituted out of repeated discrete acts of labor that are themselves 
comprised of rules and conventions, acquired through pedagogical processes, to which, at least 
in some cases, we can ourselves become acclimated. Just by striving to represent the spectrum 
of those contestations as best as we can reconstruct them from our point of historical and 
conceptual distance from our subjects, before we have even integrated our own pointed and 
particularized intellectual choices, we are already engaging in an analytical activity that, 
though rooted in the life-worlds inhabited by our sources and attentive to the rules and 
constraints by which they were governed, would never have emerged from them of its own 
accord. To illustrate how this might work, a brief concrete example of a thought experiment 
imported from an adjacent discipline might be of some use. It is pretty self-evident that an 
anthropologist studying a village in rural Karnataka, no matter how diligent, will never acquire 
the life experience of what it is like to engage in agricultural labor—thriving or merely 
surviving at the mercy of the seasons—or at least they will never so do so in a manner 
commensurate with their informant who since childhood has worked in the fields. Nonetheless, 
few doubt that the anthropologist is in a unique position to first listen attentively to those with 
this initial embodied perspective rooted in agricultural labor and then to compare and juxtapose 
that particular life-world with comparable slices of life presented to them, with just as much 
detail and personal investment, by the local Gauḍa big man, the village blacksmith, and the 
manual waste collector. Each of these people are at once individual personalities and the 
bearers of specific sets of skills. They have honed their capacities through processes of 
acculturation and training, governed, in some cases, by recoverable conventions with their own 
histories. At its best, when the researcher abstains from a rigid adherence to testing their 
46 
observations against the inherited canons of expectation provided for them by, say, structuralist 
analysis, though the end result is filtered through their own positionality and commitments, 
there is the crafting of a portrait of the extant but under documented or non-explicit interplay 
that exists among all these different rich, potentially morally vexing, and distinct fields of lived 
experience. On the basis of this solid foundation—attending to dynamics that organize the data 
gathered during fieldwork that, we must highlight, is not wholly the product of their own 
imagination—a resourceful anthropologist is then in a position to ask or impose their own 
extra-archival questions that are not part of the self-understanding of their subjects. These 
might, concern for example reconstructing historical change on a scope that exceeds the 
inherited historical memory of their subjects or recognizing—even forging—conceptual 
connections between particular isolated facets drawn from the archive of this particular village 
and other sites of comparison. Perhaps these are selected from within what is ostensibly the 
same society with aim of elucidating hidden commonalities or, more importantly, making 
evident fundamental points of differentiation within what was imagined as undifferentiated 
unity. Or, just as productively, the researcher may select a comparand from some other space 
in time, culture, and history or from a different genre or modality. Either approach can result 
in a genuine scholarly contribution. 
The important point for our purposes is that, despite a centuries worth of heated debate 
over the scope and cross cultural applicability of categories like “culture” or “society” within 
the field of anthropology, nobody posits we dispense with the initial phase of anthropological 
inquiry—fieldwork—on account of the fact that “the subject of study we call anthropology is 
not a thing found in nature with its own independent reality, but is a creative act that takes 
47place in the mind of the scholar.”39 Moreover, an anthropologist that proudly proclaims that 
they have taken great efforts to exclude from their analysis any consideration both of the self- 
understanding of their subjects and the skilled labor and conscious application of techniques 
which these agents see as integral to the constitution of their lived experience would not be 
praised for their rigor and critical judgement, even if they assert they did so in the service of 
defending the objective reality based norms of the humanist academy. Fifty years after the 
composition of Edward Said’s Orientalism, we would quite rightly challenge them—on both 
methodological and ethical grounds—as perpetuating an outmoded type of colonial armchair 
intellectualism wherein academia is animated by the paternalistic assumption that “scholar 
already knows best,” which reduces agents outside of the academy to objects fit for our 
dissection or children we need to manage. 
In reframing the collection of phenomena we label religion, whether now or in the deep 
past, among its myriad of other dimensions, as a skilled activity carried out in various ways by 
distinctive social agents, the capacity for whose exercise and mastery is in a large part an 
acquired habit that is secured within social and institutional spaces animated by their own rules 
and constraints—we say that it is a discursive space governed by conventions and subject to 
expectations that are not purely the product of a modern scholarly imagination. To make such 
a claim is to say that along with “the what” and the “why,” there is a “how.” That “how” is not 
reducible to a set of strategies that are the products of deep genealogies of Western theorization, 
based on its own archives, about taxonomization, rhetoric, strategies of self-actualization, 
39Our target, loosely paraphrased here is, of course, J. Z. Smith, though to be fair the problem is less his own perspective, which despite its self-imposed limitations as armchair scholarship was informed by truly staggering erudition, then, its subsequent reception, which frequently led to the study of culturally specific “religious” archives being treated as mere shallow pretenses for scholars exploring their pet etic methodological or political preoccupations in monographs that are largely not about the proposed subject of study.

market economics, or class politics. Should we be inclined to tackle what seem like similar 
issues as they relate to premodern Indian archives, we will need attend to parallel genealogies 
with their own elaborate and internally coherent theorization of acts of taxonomy and well- 
crafted effective speech, other stories about aspirational human aims, divergent approaches to 
managing the circulation of currency and resources, and competing canons of what comprises 
social difference, that adjudicate tensions, and impose governmentalities. Should we seek to 
substitute theory for praxis, we would do well to reconstruct what people actually practiced, 
substituting concrete stories about skill acquisition for some nebulous Western practice theory. 
This is to say, we need to be open not just to learning about our sources but learning from our 
sources. And after learning from our sources, we can continue to learn with our sources, 
querying them as dialogical partners as we ask our own questions and pursue our own specific 
research agendas. 
What if, attending to our own precarious lived realities as aspirational intellectuals 
inhabiting a proudly anti-intellectual twenty-first century, we shift our perspective. Instead of 
playacting this archaic role of demiurge showing off our mastery over the imagined worlds of 
others as we set out to construct our own ever improved imagined realities, what if we take a 
stand within the field of premodern knowledge as if we were still very much “out there” in the 
field, at the mercy of the blazing Indian sun—subject to the impositions of the unsteady and 
unpredictable alternations between indispensable guidance, apparent incoherence, and utter 
obstruction directed at us by the other agents with their own agendas who we happen to 
encounter along the way. Just like in life, we have to accept that there are important doors we 
cannot open, at least at the present moment, and that it may yet be that what is behind them 
would have proved indispensable to our endeavors. 
49 
Just like in the field, it is wise to set out with your own map and itinerary—certain 
things you want to see and questions you want to ask—or else you will wander aimlessly. And 
yet, the trip is likely to be wasted if you are not open to serendipity, to encounters with 
possibilities or the discovery of places aligned with your own governing interests to whose 
existence you were previously oblivious. At least in my own lived experience, whether in the 
archive tracking down unstudied and published sources, stumbling across whole discourses 
that fall outside of existing historiographies, out in the wilderness seeking out undocumented 
material culture, acquiring the necessary permissions from Indian authorities embedded within 
institutions whose norms are very much not transparent and clearly exist outside one’s own 
limited consciousness, or while encountering in passing people for whom religious and cultural 
life-worlds that cannot be found in the books we have yet written are palpably self-evident and 
real, in any of these circumstances a person with a modicum of self-awareness does not feel 
remotely like a demiurge—the master of all they survey. Instead, depending on the prevailing 
circumstances, one is much more likely to feel small, contingent, disposable, irritated, humble 
or even not quite up to the task that lies before them. Especially in the early stages of the 
experience, of immersing oneself in another’s reality, whether past or present, with the intent 
of learning how to navigate its parameters, what manifests is a constant experience of surprise 
as we encounter again and again the unexpected. There is a recognition of one’s ignorance 
about the terms constitutive of other peoples or discourses unconscious expectations. Even if 
you cannot at first see or conceive of them, it takes a certain arrogance to deny their existence. 
As you reflect on your self-evident unpreparedness to meet the challenges at hand with all their 
complexity on their own terms, as opposed to trying to graft onto present realities the tools you 
brought with you, ideally what is engendered is a willingness to learn from your surroundings 
50 
and from other people. The result is selective adaptation that neither annihilates who you were 
and what you thought before nor transmutes you into a carbon copy of the agents, real or 
imagined, that inhabit your site of inquiry. From such a space, offering a definitive intellectual 
contribution that “makes sense” out of nonsense is an act of hubris. We would do well to be 
gratified arriving at our destination in hand with explanations, that, as Clifford Geertz so 
eloquently and honestly put it, “are somewhat less wrong.” What would happen if we were 
take such embodied parameters as models for inquiry? Perhaps the result would be something 
like the work that is now occupying so much space on your hard drive. 
Ending the Śaiva Age: The Rise of the Brāhmaṇa Legalist and the Universalization of 
Hindu Dharma takes as its points of departure the insightful and interrelated core conceptual 
problematics raised by Hazari Prasad Dvivedi in “Paṇḍitoṃ kī Pañcāyat,” most of which are 
conspicuously absent from our larger scholarly conversations. Thus it attends to such issues 
as: the historically situated nature of changing and competing models of Brāhmaṇa identity, 
the conflict between epistemically pluralist contextualism and universal norms located at the 
heart of the scholastic traditions of Sanskrit jurisprudence, the imprecation of specific 
intellectual styles with the particular visions of the strictures of social life, the counterintuitive 
story of the gradual colonization of “empiricist” traditions of Sanskrit scholastic knowledge by 
subjective theistic theology so integral to understanding the Indian experience of early 
modernity, the historically contingent emergence of the paradigm of the dharmanibandha, 
which instigates a revolution in Hindu law, the rise of bhakti devotionalism as offering an 
implicit social contract, and, most significantly, the outsized role played by the thirteenth- 
century Maharashtrian polymath Hemādri Sūri in offering a new paradigm for binding together 
an imagined proto-Hindu “nation” in a common matrix of values and practices. Each of these 
51 
elements supplied by our Hindavī intellectual can be seen as providing us with indispensable 
pieces to a jigsaw puzzle, albeit one of which the point of culmination, the actual image that 
emerges when all the required pieces have been fit together, looks almost nothing like what 
our colonial era author had imagined. 
In essence, part of the problem is that he had been trying to assemble a ten thousand 
piece puzzle while making use of only a hundred or so pieces. As we have seen, Dvivedi’s 
imagined history of the emergence of early modern Sanskrit knowledge formations and the 
social roles with which they were aligned presumes that the external social catalyst for these 
marked transformations in values was the Islamic encounter. In contrast, the present work 
proposes that such problematics and their specific attendant histories can be best accounted for 
by placing them with a markedly different and much broader socio-historical context than the 
one Dvivedi has supplied. Succinctly, the key to locating and then fitting together the many 
pieces of this puzzle is that we must begin by filling in the empty space of the early medieval. 
Even more concretely, any understanding of the actual nature of the intervention that is made 
by the genre of the dharmanibandha in both theory and practice, particularly regarding the 
specific contributions of our Maharashtrian polymath Hemādri Sūri, necessarily entails a 
thoroughgoing reconstruction of the various discursive fields and lived realities into which this 
Brāhmaṇa legalist set out to intervene. Without the recovery of such histories of “what came 
before,” it is simply impossible to accurately identify social change and intellectual and 
theological innovation, to distinguish, as was said before, what is new from what is new to us. 
Such an approach is so integral precisely because, as we will soon discover, once we 
parochialize the identification of Āryavārta with India as whole and turn to the vast and 
internally diversified domain of the Deccan—the lived reality in which Hemādri made his 
52 
intervention—most of what we will encounter falls outside of or actively conflicts with many 
generations worth of preconceptions and generalizations concerning the nature of Indian 
religions and Indian society prior to the Islamic encounter. 
To be quite blunt, once we dive into these archives, what will rapidly become 
transparent is that the rise of the Brāhmaṇa legalist operating within a new and comprehensive 
programmatic vision of naturalizing and universalizing a theistically inflected form of 
“Brāhmaṇical normativity” is formulated as an innovative response, not to the recent incursion 
of an “alien” religion, but to over half a millennium of epistemic consensus made real and 
palpable through the work of ubiquitous and well respected institutions. As we delve into their 
working, what we will quickly see is evidence for the pervasive influence within such spaces 
of non-Brāhmaṇa agents acting as juridical and religious authorities, playing central roles in 
both the production and dissemination of religious and cultural meaning as well as enacting 
the enforcement of disciplinary norms. The stories that emerge seriously call into question core 
presumptions of our standard historiography and pedagogy, which almost exclusively center 
Brāhmaṇas as hegemonic social and religious authorities at best periodically challenged by 
subaltern dissenting voices. Succinctly, the universalization of Hindu dharma demands to be 
understood as a comprehensive program for counteracting not an imagined but an extant 
thorough pervasion throughout much of social, economic, and religious life and across the 
spectrum of social identity, of an unapologetically pluralistic mainstream vision of Indian 
religions involving a wide range of different types of social agents heavily inflected by praxis 
and values stemming from the influence of the Śaiva and Śākta Tantras. In other words, to 
think historically in a particularized fashion about the conditions of possibility for the Indian 
53 
encounter with early modernity is essentially to tell the story of what was the Śaiva Age and 
how did it end. 
Ending the Śaiva Age: A Chapter Itinerary 
Taking as its inspiration some of Dvivedi’s key insights about the diversity of perspectives and 
opinions contained within what is often treated as the reified category of Brāhmaṇical 
normativity, chapter 1, “Defamiliarizing the Brāhmaṇical World,” seeks to demonstrate on 
empirical grounds some of the hermeneutical stumbling blocks that are posed by our easy 
embrace of conceptual frameworks like “Brāhmaṇism,” “Brāhmaṇical identity,” and 
“Brāhmaṇical ideology.” All too often, scholars of Hindu traditions treat these frameworks as 
if their content were self-evident, internally consistent, and cohesive—that is to say, as trans- 
historical categories—as opposed to ones that are historically and geographically contingent, 
internally contested, and constantly and often self-consciously evolving. Even more 
problematically, much as if we were the structuralist anthropologists of the last century, there 
is a tendency to treat such formulations as if they provide us with a comprehensive account of 
the form and the content of premodern Indian sociality, an interpretive choice that has served 
to elide substantive consideration of how a particularized study of premodern institutions and 
their norms might contribute to a deeper understanding of lived Indian religions. 
We thus begin with an evidence-based disaggregation of Brāhmaṇical normativity, 
historicizing the discrete emergence of its supposedly constitutive elements, complicating 
accounts of its political and social agenda as contrasted with presumptions about śramaṇa 
modes of governmentality, and attending to internal contestations about the nature and scope 
of Brāhmaṇical authority found within the realm of both śāstra and our documentary records. 
What quickly becomes evident is that what constitutes the defining features, methodology, and 
54 
regent ideology of “classical Brāhmaṇism” has everything to do with which sources you 
privilege, a testament to the internal diversity of a discourse typically treated as speaking with 
a singular ideological voice. As we will see, center the earliest work of Vedic commentary and 
the exegetical traditions of Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika in place of the typical canon that privileges 
the presuppositions of the Pūrva Mīmāṃsā and Patañjali’s social theorization of Vyākaraṇa 
and effectively you have a different vision of what constitutes Brāhmaṇical normativity. When 
we recognize this internal diversity, the methodological justification for projecting a unified 
Brāhmaṇical ideology as the orienting value system onto any space in the historical record 
where we encounter Brāhmaṇa social agents begins to break down. When we compare these 
archival realities with their representation in standard works of Indian historiography, the 
dynamics on display are much more nuanced and complicated than has been assumed in our 
metanarratives and many core claims about its ideological content, particularly in relation to 
questions of theology, are simply not supported by the very proof texts that are habitually 
invoked. The chapter will conclude by attending to two quite significant features of much of the 
“classical” Brāhmaṇical discourse conducted in scholastic Sanskrit that, nonetheless, play 
almost no role in our reflection on the nature of Indic religion. The first feature is a tradition 
of empiricism with a pluralistic vision of the nature of authority within which different modes 
of knowledge are viewed as intrinsically circumscribed by discipline, community, and 
spatiality. This is our introduction to a core epistemic frame—the notion of site- or context- 
specific knowledge that finds its Hindi analog in Dvivedi’s worried ruminations about sthānīya 
ācāra. Instead of being a product of the Islamic encounter, we will find that already by the 
Gupta era it is a widely prevalent conceptual framework evident throughout both Brāhmaṇa 
55 
and non-Brāhmaṇa Deccani imaginaries, the consideration of which will prove integral to 
every other stage of our investigations. 
The second occluded dimension of these classical discourses is a widely shared, and 
unduly neglected, emic conceptualization found in classical sources, ranging from Kumārila 
Bhaṭṭa to Pāśupata theologians like Kauṇḍinya, about the transactional nature of an extra- 
śāstric social world and the problematic mutability of socially constructed identities that are 
product of particular regimes of pedagogy and conditioning. Both of these discourses have 
significant implications for determining what makes someone a Brāhmaṇa or more generally, 
a source of authority. Having demonstrated the inadequacy of a plug-and-play imposition of 
“Brāhmaṇical normativity” as offering an adequate account of the ideological and material 
foundations of premodern Indian sociality, our inquiry then takes as its guide shared reflections 
and anxieties found throughout classical śāstra about institutions and paradigms of Indian 
sociality that are extra-śāstric, where legitimate authority is determined by documentary 
records, not scholastic norms, a realm where it is not the pandit or the poet but the scribe and 
the corporation who are the holders of institutional memory and the adjudicators of norms. 
Thus, in chapter 2, “A Beginningless Transactionality: Recovering the Quotidian 
Institutional Realities of the Early Medieval,” we begin our entry into the world of the 
premodern Indian institution as a disciplinary system through the unexpected avenue of 
thinking about premodern paperwork, the range of social agents who commission it as well as 
those who compose it, the circumstances that render it necessary, and the rules that govern its 
production. Attuning ourselves to understanding how we can recover strategic decision- 
making and individual choices by first familiarizing ourselves with the inherited repertoire of 
compositional choices a scribe might make use of in converting a template for document 
56 
production into a specific contract or letter will provide us with a paradigm for making sense 
of more complicated modes of cultural production in both text and stone. We will also discover 
that even for non-literate or quasi literate people, the type of transactional Sanskrit that made 
up the many perishable documents required by law to legitimate most kinds of social 
transactions, whose idiom is heavily inflected by the realm of kāvya, would have represented 
the most evident site of encounter with the norms of what has been called the Sanskrit 
cosmopolis. We look at how a study of such sources and their sites of production can already 
begin to grant us access in passing to non-elite and non-Brāhmaṇa life-worlds of the sort that 
only rarely impinge upon the rarefied realm of the śāstras. We will also then attend to how 
similar conventions come to inform parallel transactional discourses carried out in vernacular 
languages, such as old Kannada, which provide us with some the richest and untouched 
archives on the subcontinent for recovering highly specific religious and social realities. In 
attending to the prescriptive instructions located within Dharmaśāstra discourses about the 
making of documents, the recording of verbal testimony, and the necessary role these resources 
play in legitimating all sorts of institutions, we will also begin to see how classical dharma 
discourses themselves provide many of the conceptual frameworks that underwrite the 
flourishing of the distinctively Śaiva and Śākta-Śaiva institutions, here exemplified by an 
important sacred center at Kukkunur in central Karnataka, that made possible the Śaiva Age. 
In chapter 3, “The King Must Protect the Difference: The Juridical Foundations of 
Tantric Knowledge,” drawing upon inscriptional, art historical, as well as largely unstudied 
and unpublished textual evidence in classical Sanskrit, Aiśa, and old Kannada, we examine the 
conceptualization of religious diversity in the medieval Deccan, especially as it was articulated 
under the Kalyāṇi Cālukyas, the dominant regional power from the tenth to twelfth century. 
57What our archive suggests, somewhat counterintuitively, is that from the perspective of the 
state and other disciplinary institutions, religious difference was conceived of in primarily 
juridical as opposed to doxographical terms; it was a matter of law rather than belief. In other 
words, in practice, the social performance of the religious identities of particular communities 
proved inseparable from the delineation of the highly specific legal rights and obligations to 
which those communities were entitled to adhere. Succinctly, medieval India’s religious 
diversity was inextricable from the widespread acceptance of a rather capaciously imagined 
emic form of legal pluralism. As we shall see, the early medieval Dharmaśāstric commentarial 
tradition locates the textual foundation of this approach to legal pluralism in a discrete and 
consistent canon of textual resources. As this chapter demonstrates, by the eighth century— 
from the perspective of the Brāhmaṇical legalists themselves—it is this internally coherent 
body of dharma knowledge that emerges as the key conceptual resource that makes a place 
within the wider social ecologies of the medieval Deccan for the Tantric knowledge systems 
and those who practice them. Just as importantly, it is this framework, articulated within 
Brāhmaṇical Dharmaśāstras, that makes it incumbent upon a king, or any comparable medieval 
acting political authority down to the local level, to preserve and protect the independence of 
a wide range of institutions located outside of the state and governed by their own localized 
community-specific norms. By attending to rhetorical continuities between documentary 
records in old Kannada, prescriptions in the Dharmaśāstra and what we find in the Tantric 
sources, especially the unpublished likely late-eighth or early-ninth-century Śākta Pratiṣṭhā 
work, the Piṅgalāmata, we can begin to recover some of the inner working and modes of 
disciplinarity that animated and governed these independent Tantric spaces while adjusting our 
understanding of the purview of the Śaiva and Śākta-Śaiva gurus who mastered and transmitted 
58 
the Tantras so as to incorporate a recognition of their role as authorities in the real world 
wielding political, legal, and economic power over a community that saw them as the source 
of both practical and liberative knowledge. We are also introduced, albeit in passing, to the 
working mechanism that creates bonds of cross caste solidarity, amounting to a Tantric social 
contract, a feature of the cultural landscape whose profound ramifications for Deccani sociality 
we will continue to explore in upcoming chapters. 
In the second half of the chapter, we examine an unpublished work of Sanskrit 
commentary, which I discovered and have been reading from a codex unicus Malayalam script 
manuscript, on the late sixth- to early seventh-century non-Brāhmaṇa Śivadharmaśāstra. The 
so-called “Deliberation of Śiva’s Dharma” (Śivadharmavivaraṇa) offers us a case study of the 
contents of the sort of non-Brāhmaṇa community-specific normative governmentality that was 
explicitly envisioned as a substitute for varṇāśramadharma within some Śaiva governed 
spaces and whose protection, within appropriate domains, was mandated by the early medieval 
state. And it is here, almost five hundred years before Dvivedi would have anticipated— 
articulated in Sanskrit and not the vernacular—that an effusive emotionalist bhakti envisioned 
as the dharma incumbent on all Śaivas and, counterintuitively, conceptualized as a juridical 
norm whose breach warrants punishment, first enters into our story. As we will see in the 
upcoming chapters, traces of this value system’s impact, often presented as a counterpoint to 
Vaidika Brāhmaṇa authority, permeate the rhetorical presentations and life stories of most of 
the historical agents, whatever their demographic backgrounds, we will consider in this work. 
Equipped with a much better sense of the transactional expectations, juridical 
normativities and constraints, and the episteme of site- and community-specific pluralism that 
animated premodern institutions in the early medieval Deccan, in chapter 4, “Living in the 
59 
Śaiva Age: Three Embodied Encounters with Authority and Responsibility,” we turn away 
from the consideration of the abstract frameworks that were constitutive of lived religious 
realities to stage an encounter with some of the people who inhabited them. Towards this end, 
drawing again on both Sanskrit and old Kannada sources, we recover from the archive three 
particularized non-Brāhmaṇa voices drawn from across the spectrum of social normativity, and 
retrace their professional trajectory as they ascended into positions of authority. Our 
protagonists are 1) Habbĕya Nāyaka (ca. 1186 CE), a local Śūdra big man whose family 
successfully evaded a fall into untouchability and married into the local landed authority, 
enabling their great-grandson to wield the kind localized social influence essential in founding 
a temple, albeit with some helpful guidance from his Kālamukha guru, 2) Kaḷēśvara (ca. 1167 
CE) a Kālamukha siddha who skillfully navigates transregional monastic institutional politics 
by catering to different constituencies, going from caste guru of some goldsmiths to rājaguru 
of the Sindha kings, at the very same time he purportedly successfully completes a personal 
quest for liberation while living. Our study of Kaḷēśvara and his journey through specific 
Kālamukha networks animated by Śākta-Śaiva values introduces us more generally to the 
outsized role played by the underexamined Kālamukhas, generally presumed to represent a 
non-Tantric Śaiva tradition, in constituting the institutional realities of the early medieval 
Deccan. It also returns us, yet again, to a place called Kukkunur, a Śākta pīṭha that figures 
repeatedly in our story of how the Śaiva Age ended and for which we have copious multilingual 
documentary records spanning hundreds of years. 
Last but by no means least, 3) we examine the interrelated life stories of three 
generations of the sovereign powers who defined the early medieval western Deccan, the 
Kalyāṇi Cālukya kings Someśvara I (r. 1042–1068), Vikramāditya VI (r. 1076–1126), and 
60 
Someśvara III (r. 1126–1138), largely through the lens of Someśvara III’s own writings. Not 
beholden to any external constraints or pregiven poetic conventions, Someśvara III is in a 
unique position to represent the unvarnished plurality of values and interests within the 
Cāḷukya court and to offer a nuanced account of how his forbears responded to the competing 
claims proffered by the Dharmaśāstra with their own commitments to a cult of antinomian 
Tantric worship animated by a theology of Śaiva bhakti with its own demands. 
Despite their disparate social locations within discrete hierarchies, in each of these 
cases there are uncanny commonalities to the stories presented by our protagonists. For each 
person, real-world life decisions are informed in surprising ways by values they ascribe to their 
esoteric commitment to modes of Tantric knowledge and practice. On a purely documentary 
level, for the first time, these concrete case studies situate the esoteric traditions of the Trika, 
the Krama, and the cult of Svacchanda Bhairava alongside the Paścimāmnāya within the 
particularized documentary record of the Deccan as bodies of knowledge, intermingled with 
more mundane forms of everyday religion, that nonetheless exert an extra-textual influence. 
More broadly conceived, taken as a whole, these three accounts offer us concrete instantiations 
of how the imagined prescriptive realities found in classical Tantric sources would have 
interfaced with complex on-the-ground realities inhabited by a multiplicity of social agents 
with their own competing agendas. 
Through attending to a transregional visual archive I produced on the basis of fieldwork 
at over thirty distinct field sites located in what are now Maharashtra, Karnataka, and 
Telangana, a number of which have never incorporated into Western scholarship, Chapter 5, “ 
A Substantive Intervention: Reading the Material Culture of the Western Deccan across 
Region and Dynasty,” introduces us to discursive regularity in the iconography and built spaces 
61 
of early medieval temples and monasteries. Here we aim to document both examples of 
reoccurrence, pointing to the prevalence of parallel phenomena across great distances and 
patterned transformation over time. Our particular interest is in using iconography to 
understand how within a pluralistic episteme incorporative of a range of other aims and values, 
Tantric commitments, frequently wedded to royal power, were translated into material culture 
and proliferated in space. Despite some tactical and stylistic variation, the lavishly illustrated 
story we will recover is indicative of core continuities suggesting a private and plausibly pre- 
Tantric cult of sanguine Bhairava worship aligned with royal power. The articulation of such 
a paradigm is perhaps even in evidence in the visual archive of the Kadamba kings, but 
certainly it is well established by the seventh century among the Bādāmi Caḷukyas. We will 
document its persistence alongside other commitments among the Rāṣṭrakūṭas and their vassals 
before showing how it receives a new articulation in the age of the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas and their 
eastern rivals in the eleventh and twelfth centuries that publicizes such connections much more 
consistently in stone. 
The chapter also offers the beginning of a complementary narrative, taking as it focus 
major Kālamukha institutional centers, especially the great temple university complex at 
Balligave. On the basis of the vast but unstudied material cultural archive of the Śaktipariṣad, 
in opposition to longstanding presumptions rooted in the work of David Lorenzen that the 
Kālamukhas represent a moderate Brāhmaṇical wing of Śaiva traditions, it makes the case that 
by at least the early eleventh century, Kālamukha monasteries are essentially centered around 
the worship of Bhairava and Kāpālika-inflected dangerous goddesses and have become the 
primary sites for the dissemination of the Śākta Tantras. On the basis of the institutional 
histories of some of these spaces as they cultivate specific constituencies down into the present, 
62 
it begins to make the case, already suggested several times in passing in prior chapters, for the 
close affiliation of Kālamukha monastic networks with Śūdra artisans, especially sculptor 
śilpins and goldsmiths. After touring the remains of the Cāḷukya capital at Kalyāṇa, the chapter 
concludes with a visit to the until now undocumented śilpin artisanal workshop, located in the 
town of Ramling Mudgal, that provided the material culture commissioned for Cāḷukya capital, 
whose underlying conceptual realities reflected in both documentary records and prescriptive 
Tantric sources we will explore in the following chapter. Previously falling under the 
jurisdiction of Kālamukha ācāryas, in early modernity down to the recent present, Ramling 
Mudgal has maintained its affiliation with lineages of non-Brāhmaṇa Śaiva yogins, hailing 
from goldsmith families, whose samādhis still populate its landscape. Once again, we will find 
that, if you know where to look, the past is not dead, and in fact in some ways has not even 
passed. As both social space and conceptual object, we have discovered over the past several 
chapters that the Deccan was effectively defined by the translation—into text, praxis, and 
materiality—of very specific epistemological commitments that imagined the world as 
founded upon irreducible diversity-linked specific sites and communities. This was no mere 
imagined utopianism, as we have already begun to see that the Deccan abounded in very real 
and well-funded land grants, animated by an array of site and community-specific values and 
protected by the full force of the law. As chapter 6, “Art and Terror in the City of Śiva: Śākta 
Artisan Imaginaries and the Making of a Material World” will make clear, many of these acts 
of translating such values into lived realities were very specifically the product of the life- 
world of the medieval artisans. Through minting the coins, engraving the inscriptions, 
installing the irrigation systems, designing urban areas, crafting the temples, and sculpting the 
63 
gods such agents quite literally built the Deccan. And yet, almost nothing of substance has 
been written about them.40 “Art and Terror in the City of Śiva” carves out a place— 
sociologically, doxographically, cosmologically, intellectually, and perhaps even 
phenomenologically—within our existing historiography for making sense of the contributions 
of the early medieval Deccani artisan. It demonstrates that there is a preponderance of evidence 
for treating these figures as essentially a special kind of Śākta yogin whose initiation into 
Tantric knowledge was inseparable from professionalization as an artisan. It locates such 
figures as working under the direction of influential and well established Kālamukha 
preceptors who served as their guild masters and gurus. Along with many other communities 
of performers and craftsmen professionalized along similar trajectories and whose stories also 
deserve to be told, it shows that, though taking commissions from the wider world, guru and 
śilpin disciple alike lived in a parallel social reality governed by traditions of monastic 
governmentality inflected by texts like the Śivadharma.41 Thus, this chapter aims to reconstruct 
40In the all too long span of time that elapsed between the composition of this chapter and its “publication,” thankfully this deficit has begun to be remedied. Approaching the world of the Bādāmi Caḷukyas from an art historical perspective, chapter 3 of Subhashini Kaligotla’s Shiva’s Waterfront Temples offers a compelling account of the centrality of artisan gurus to the intended reception of Caḷukya material culture. The treatment of the physical positioning of epigraphic records representing these “makers” as indicative of their pivotal place in the lived imaginaries surrounding these spaces is particularly convincing. Subhashini Kaligotla, Shiva’s Waterfront Temples: Architects and Their Audiences in Medieval India (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2022). 41 My thinking in this regard, which will prove a ubiquitous conceptual frame throughout this thesis, is profoundly indebted to Indrani Chatterjee’s articulation, adapting Foucault to the Indian, especially Assamese context, of monastic governmentality, which she first articulated in her book, Indrani Chatterjee, Forgotten Friends: Monks, Marriages, and Memories of Northeast India (New York: Oxford University Press, 2013). As Chatterjee writes: “To accept initiation was equivalent to submission to a legal–moral and disciplinary practice that was identified with particular teachers. . . . Similar initiation committed disciples of other traditions also to mandated, physical and mental-emotional observances, that dissolved the ‘individual self’ into a larger and more potent entity, whether that of a guru, or that of the guru’s own ritual-intellectual teachers, and through them to an even wider group of followers and disciples. Rituals of initiation, common to most teaching-learning societies in the subcontinent, had a threefold implication for a South Asian history of politics. They shaped subjectivities of entire lineages of students and teachers by means of shared discipline of appetites and desires, bodies and minds. They secured the availability of administrative and military personnel; and they established and elaborated an economic system and network. . . . An equally important aspect of this form of politics was the availability of trained and disciplined clerical, artisanal, and military personnel that initiation and ordination established. . . . An ubiquitous system of monastic administrations and economies existed in many Asian societies ranging from Mongolia to the 
64 
the self-understanding of these social actors as well as the institutional frameworks, especially 
matters of pedagogy, ritual professionalization along with the emic political theologies 
surrounding their work in the establishing of temples and land grants. It is these confluences 
of emic frameworks that made artisans into the types of people seen as suited for carrying out 
their assigned social roles as craftspeople who translate ideas into the building blocks that make 
up institutions. As we shall see, the portrait that emerges of the socially embedded 
implementation of esoteric knowledge diverges in interesting ways from our standard 
perceptions of the purview and the function of the Tantric knowledge systems and their 
relationship to the supposedly moribund traditions of the pre-Tantric Atimārga. 
We begin by making the case for the emic understanding of an artisan as a kind of 
yogin. After seeking to situate the discourse on pratiṣṭhā within the wider field of Tantric 
knowledge with surprising results, by inquiring into mainstream śāstric discourses on the role 
of the śilpin, we will next begin to make sense of the types of agents that would have been 
islands of Southeast Asia during the late medieval and early modern periods. . . . The third and most important aspect of these ritualized relationships was economic. All initiates paid for their learning and assimilation in some form. Sanskrit legalists used terms such as dakshina to refer the exchange of services between a skilled teacher and a lay disciple or ‘patron’. The quality, size and nature of these payments separated the humbler initiates from their wealthier counterparts. . . . Labour services at one end and precious bullion at another connected the same order of disciples through their common subjection to the adept teacher-master. Commoner labour-providers, wealthy merchants, and fierce warriors could all be counted among the lay (or un-ordained) disciples or ‘subjects’ (Sanskrit praja) and simultaneously patrons and protectors, of a monastic or teaching lineage and all its residential sites, fields, herds, and goods. The wealthiest however appeared to have given produce of cultivable or uncultivated lands to individual members of a monastic or teaching lineage, declaring the recipients and the lands exempt from taxes and labour-levies. . . . These payments and grants enabled heads of monasteries, or their most ardent lay disciples, to assemble a heterogenous and differentially skilled set of people on those lands. . . . Sometimes these authorities acted on behalf of laymen. Sometimes these were the donors’ own bureaucracy, especially those of law-enforcement personnel (chat-bhat). Exemption from their ingress into the gifted estate, and exemption from their search warrants, meant that the ‘sovereignty’ of then recipient was localized, shaped by the terms of the grant. . . . Within these limits, wealthy or powerful monastic donors exchanged their own powers of tax collection or authority over a group of people for the skills and support of a non-Buddhist adept, his teaching–disciple lineage, and the lineage’s support and participation in the donor’s government. Thus, monks sometimes received the moral authority to punish crimes committed by villagers within their domain, and the economic authority to collect sale taxes and charge fines and arrears. In sum, such grants decentralized the powerful monastic donor’s own authority by making his favoured monastic lineage, or another lineage or teacher responsible for many aspects of pastoral care” (Chatterjee, Forgotten Friends, 5–8).

inculcated into these forms of knowledge, placing them into dialogue with delineations of the 
role of the śilpin as householder and yogin found within the Śākta sources. In reconstructing 
the basically unnoticed life-world of the Śākta artisan, we look at how professionalization, 
philosophical speculation, material culture, and pedagogy are understood to operate within 
these communities as well as how this mode of textuality responds to and encounters more 
familiar forms of Sanskritic discourse. Finally, having at least oriented ourselves to the life- 
world of the śilpin, through a close reading of a Śākta Śilpaśāstra’s treatment of pratiṣṭhā, we 
will examine both the pragmatics and political theology that governed all acts of 
institutionalization within the medieval Deccan, at least from the perspective of some of the 
people we call Kālamukhas and their disciples. 
Throughout the chapter, though we draw upon a range of Śaiva and Śākta 
doxographies, cosmologies, Śaiva Tantras and vernacular textual traditions, our analysis will 
be anchored in a close reading of a number of chapters from the largely unstudied and likely 
late-eighth-century Śākta Tantra, the Piṅgalāmata, whose use in the Deccan during this period 
is attested to by the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya kings themselves. We will see that the Piṅgalāmata 
contains a number of elements that both speak to the intersection of Kālamukha institutional 
cultures with transgressive Śākta practices as well as indicating their fundamental continuity 
with pre-Tantric Atimārgic artisanal traditions. Returning to the materials we first encountered 
in chapter 3, we look at the role that the ritualized communal consumption of “transgressive” 
substances prescribed within the Śākta Tantras, which formed a defining feature of acts of 
institutionalization as well as their inaugural celebration. Quite apart from their soteriological 
or epistemological significance, the communal consumption of such substances was seen as 
forging a kind of cross-caste solidarity, based on shared initiations that made possible 
66 
community affect experiences, between kings, patrons, artisans, performers, sādhakas, and the 
merchant councils who under the Śākta-Śaiva gurus managed the Kālamukha institutions that 
facilitated real-world coordination of their efforts in the service of shared goals. In the last part 
of the chapter, we also begin examining the afterlife of Deccani artisan religion, whose 
historical memories of a systematic dismantling of independent artisan specific life-worlds on 
the cusp of early modernity will resonate with the historical accounts of the deliberate 
unmaking of Śaiva institutional cultures with which this dissertation will conclude. 
With chapter 7, “Remembering Medieval Maharashtra: The Early Seuṇa Yādavas in 
the World,” our scope of inquiry shifts from a more general reconstruction of the Cāḷukya 
dominated Deccan as a whole to the specific life-worlds and histories of the region now called 
Maharashtra, whose prehistory in the early medieval period scholarship has typically presumed 
to be unrecoverable. The objective of this chapter, in the absence of deep textual archives, is 
to help situate early medieval Maharashtra within the wider purview of the institutional, 
theological, and political flows that animated the medieval Deccan. In this manner, through a 
series of intersectional case studies, often combining close readings of documentary records 
with examinations of situ material culture complemented by fieldwork at over twenty sites, our 
exploration will bring into sharp relief the distinctive features of Maharashtra’s medieval 
religious and political imaginaries prior to the thirteenth century. In the first section, through a 
reinvestigation of sacred centers already discussed in some detail by the inimitable Günther 
Sonthemier,42 we will examine how the narrative and ritual traditions in circulation among the 
42One of the most innovative and insightful scholars of Indian religions in the twentieth century, somewhat ironically, Günther Sontheimer’s intellectual trajectory presents us with an almost direct inversion of the present project, for he began his career as a textualist engaged in the study of Sanskrit Dharmaśāstra removed from its cultural environs and culminated it by undertaking the tragically never completed study that aimed at reconstructing pan-Deccani and south Indian religious currents, much of them centered around the worship of fierce male deities mounted on horseback, with deep histories that exist almost entirely outside the realm of elite textual production. Sontheimer’s analysis is eerily aligned with the life-worlds of the Śaiva Age in a manner that 
67Dhangar, a nomadic people of the Deccan, which are typically interpreted as non-elite 
expressions of “folk culture” that operate in contradistinction to elite narratives, are themselves 
all but saturated with traces of the Tantric-inflected political and social imaginaries, inclusive 
of the artisan yogins whose life-world we have just been exploring, in which the religious and 
political elites of the early medieval world were key participants. 
In our second study, through an examination that historicizes the transposition of the 
cult of Mahālakṣmī of Kolhapur in southern Maharashtra into eastern Maharashtra, the 
Kuntaladēśa, and southern Karnataka, attending especially to material culture, we will develop 
an awareness of the interconnected nature of Deccani institutions complemented by a new 
understanding of precisely what outsiders in the medieval period perceived to be some of the 
distinctive features of Maharashtrian religion and material culture in the era before the 
emergence of old Marathi literature. Succinctly, the Maharashtrian style most notably diverges 
from transregional Cāḷukya norms first in its unapologetic representation of a cremation 
ground culture religiosity centered around yoginīs and then increasingly in its adamant 
embrace of a siddha culture in which visual representations of yogins gradually supplant the 
gods themselves as the focus of worship. The chapter concludes by demonstrating, through an 
is mutually illuminative of both archives, but in the absence of a strong sense of the nature of the early medieval Deccan such connections are not always clearly fleshed out. Our own engagement with Sonthemier’s work will take as its focus some of his case studies of the oral traditions of the nomadic Dhangars of Maharashtra and their oral memories about sacred sites dedicated to the worship of fierce male deities. While in Sontheimer’s work these particular archives are primarily used to reconstruct more archaic dimensions of pre-Brāhmaṇical Deccani religion, we will find that the same sites and sources, especially when material culture is taken into account, can also be constructively engaged with in the service of recovering the specificity of early medieval lived imaginaries expressive of the intersection of site-specific cultures and the institutional and theological norms of the Śaiva Age. See for example Günther-Dietz Sontheimer, Pastoral Deities in Western India (New York, Oxford University Press, 1989), pg. 22–30; Anne Feldhaus and Günther-Dietz Sontheimer, trans., Birobā, Mhaskobā und Khaṇḍobā: Ursprung, Geschichte und Umwelt von Pastoralen Gottheiten in Mahārāṣṭra (Wiesbaden: Steiner, 1976). Sontheimer's general writings on the deity Khaṇḍobā have been reprinted in Pastoral Deities in Western India.

examination of the early inscriptional record read in relation to material culture, just how 
keenly the early Seuṇa Yādava kings, throughout most of this period vassals of the Kalyāṇi 
Cāḷukyas, represent themselves as active and passionate participants in the two successive 
paradigms that animated this unabashedly Śākta Tantric theological and social milieus. It also 
documents how these imaginaries change as the long twelfth century draws to a close and the 
Cāḷukya imperium fades into the background. In reconstructing some of the particularized 
religious and political life-worlds of eleventh and twelfth century Maharashtra, a task rendered 
all the more difficult by the paucity of textual sources, “Remembering Medieval Maharashtra: 
The Early Seuṇa Yādavas in the World” offers us an initial glimpse of the institutional and 
religious realities that will be forcibly elided in the thirteenth century by a newly imagined 
Seuṇa Yādava imperium increasingly under the direction of Hemādri Sūri and his 
universalization of Hindu dharma. 
Building upon the foundation of the conceptual project undertaken in the previous 
chapter that sought to recover traces of the social, institutional, and religious world of the early 
Seuṇa kings on the basis of much less robust archival evidence, chapter 8 “Śākta 
Cosmopolitanism: The Seuṇa Yādava Imaginary before Hemādri” offers us a vivid portrait of 
the religious and social imaginaries at the Seuṇa Yādava court in the early decades of the 
thirteenth century. Here our focus is quite specifically recovering the dominant worldview in 
the decades immediately preceding the composition of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi within the 
very same institutional cultures over which Hemādri would come to preside. Challenging 
recent representations of the Seuṇa Yādava polity as a Brāhmaṇical ecumene, through 
systematically reading the multilingual inscriptional record in the context of the material 
environs in which our documentary records are embedded and through prosopographical 
69 
analysis of the ministers, Āyurvedic physicians, astrologers, musicologists, intellectual 
luminaries, and military commanders who populated the Seuṇa court under King Siṅghaṇa II, 
this chapter demonstrates there is overwhelming evidence for the thorough permeation of the 
entire milieu by an emergent Śākta imaginary, translated into both text and stone. In fact, 
virtually every recoverable social actor, including the king himself, was thoroughly imprecated 
in these very specific values and practices. 
The chapter concludes with the evidence for the transposing of this Śākta imaginary 
into non-courtly contexts, such as the recently excavated temple complexes at Amba Jogai 
produced under the patronage of the commander of the Seuṇa armies. Here in situ, we see the 
intersection of these more official Śākta religious imaginaries with parallel emergent 
vernacular traditions of siddha veneration that, though also deeply indebted to Kaula theology, 
perceive themselves as post-Tantric. Our efforts in this regard benefit from an examination of 
the late-twelfth-century old Marathi Vivekasindhu, a work that has never been the focus of 
scholarly attention in the West. Purportedly composed at Ambajogai just before the reign of 
Siṅghana II, while this largely neglected treatise is characterized in secondary literature as the 
earliest vernacular treatment of Advaita Vedānta, a closer engagement with the work reveals 
it as in fact offering a fusion of Tantric and post-Tantric values expressed in the earthy idiom 
of yogī-bhāṣā. Succinctly, while drawing heavily upon a conceptual idiom derived from both 
the Krama and the Trika, the Vivekasindhu rejects the imagery of the cremation ground and 
the consumption of transgressive substances. In their place, it proposes a novel model of 
sādhanā in which the intellectual insights of Advaita Vedānta, no longer bounded by 
Brāhmaṇa identity, are rendered real and lasting through ritualized consort practice. Attending 
to such moments of continued innovation, wherein śāstric knowledge has received a surprising 
70 
reception, prepares us for the complicated articulations of new forms of “just imagined” 
orthodoxy to which our attention now turns. 
Now that, at long last, that we have in hand a particularized working portrait of the 
multidimensional norms, practices, institutional spaces and values out of which for many 
hundreds of years a multitude of different social agents had crafted their own site- and 
community-specific realities, we are in position to understand how, through the composition 
of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, a work whose conceptual program is fused with the real-world 
practices of the Seuṇa Yādava state, Hemādri deliberately disrupts the existing institutional 
cultures and religious imaginaries of the western Deccan. As we shall see, what is substituted 
in their place is the universalizing vision of Hindu dharma, a proscriptive vision of a unitary 
truth whose norms take precedent over site- and community-specific value. In this model, 
which so often gets conflated with Hinduism in toto, disciplinary power as well as an exclusive 
monopoly over religious authority is solely vested in the hands of the Smārta Brāhmaṇa 
legalist. As our investigations up to this point have prepared us to recognize, far from being 
the invariant core of “Brāhmaṇism,” this particular worldview is the highly novel and 
contingent product of a unique historical moment unfolding on the cusp of early modernity, 
whose emergence is largely independent from the story of Islamic incursion. 
Chapter 9, “Universalizing Hindu Dharma: Hemādri and his Legacy,” commences the 
sequence of the three chapters that conclude the present work. Though taking as their 
conditions of possibility the preceding reconstruction of the site- and community-specific 
pluralism and its entanglement with the Tantric knowledge systems that animated the concrete 
institutional realities of the early medieval Deccan, these chapters tell a discrete story 
concerning the rise of the “Brāhmaṇa” legalist as the exclusive adjudicator of previously 
71 
pluralistic religious realities and as promulgators of a new and comprehensive Smārta religious 
vision that seeks to saturate the Sanskrit knowledge systems with an effusive theistic 
worldview. “Universalizing Hindu Dharma: Hemādri and His Legacy” recovers from the 
documentary and material culture record the untold story of how with the death of Siṅghaṇa II 
in 1245 CE, the Seuṇa Yādava kings disrupt the existing social contract that had animated 
Deccani institutional cultures for hundreds of years. Overnight, they cease to patronize or 
recognize the legitimacy of Kālamukha administered ritual complexes. Abrogating their 
responsibilities regarding the founding, maintenance, and protection of undying land grants 
governed by their own site- and community-specific norms, such sites are either defunded out 
of existence or annexed and incorporated into the state. Through a series of case studies of 
institutional disruption, including an account of the eviction of the Kālamukhas of Kukkunur, 
we examine the evidence for the implementation of a new regime of much more delimited 
juridical and property rights that placed the management of previously autonomous tax-free 
spaces under the watchful eye of new class of “Brāhmaṇa” legalist regulators with direct 
oversight by the Seuṇa Yādava state, effectively liquidating both the economic and political 
power of non-Brāhmaṇa religious agents, especially those with strong Śākta commitments. 
Both in its contents and specific rhetoric, this real-world socio-political program is then 
shown to be thoroughly consonant with the prescriptive conceptual project articulated by 
Hemādri Sūri in the Caturvargacintāmaṇi calling for the universalization of dharma. On the 
basis of both documentary sources and his own testimonials, in a manner that is itself with few 
precedents in the history of Sanskrit literature, Hemādri emerges from the archive as a vivid, 
particularized, and highly opinionated personality. With great self-awareness, Hemādri 
innovatively set out to articulate a new episteme that reimagines the scope, theoretical 
72 
foundation, and contents of Dharmaśāstra while offering a set of pedagogical tools designed 
to rapidly professionalize a vast new cadre of Brāhmaṇa authorities to fill the newly crafted 
roles whose proliferation is mandated by his manifesto. Through the power of his office, which 
marries the capacities inherent with being the chief advisor of the Seuṇa king and frequently 
the de facto ruler of the kingdom with a new kind of governmentality made possible by direct 
oversight over a newly centralized transregional bureaucracy that manages the activities of 
scribes and record keepers present within each and every institution, Hemādri was in a unique 
position to rapidly translate śāstric ideations into lived realities. 
Thus, in chapter 9, a specific historical account of on-the-ground social change 
recovered through a series of case studies of documentary sources and material culture finds 
its complement in a series of close readings examining different aspects of the prescriptive 
vision of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, which articulate the values that animated such a sea 
change. Exploring published resources contained within the CVC that have never been the 
focus of serious academic study, we examine in some detail Hemādri’s account of philanthropy 
(dāna), which, breaking from the stances staked out by its immediate predecessors, 
incorporates a retheorization of property rights that, couched in an ethical critique of non- 
normative social standards, effectively cuts non-Brāhmaṇas out of the gift economy. This 
extract from the Dānakhaṇḍa is placed into dialogue with parallel discussions, from the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s Śrāddhakalpa, that with great precision seek to curtail the direct 
participation of a large swath of the population whose life-worlds were imbricated with the 
Tantric knowledge systems from any meaningful participation in a shared public religious life. 
Complementing this analysis in turn are a series of case studies, drawing upon unpublished 
manuscripts containing two extensive portions of the CVC previously assumed to be lost, 
73 
namely, substantial portions of the treatise on pilgrimage (Tīrthakhaṇḍa) and the opening 
chapter of the subdivision offering a Smārta retheorization of acts of institutionalization 
(Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati). Read in tandem, these two portions of the text reveal how Hemādri 
programmatically reimagines the very nature of Hindu pilgrimage to specific existing sacred 
centers in a manner that overrides site- and community-specific norms. Examining the practical 
application of these scholastic models, we will then see how our author reinvents the practices 
and values that animate the construction of new sacred centers in a manner that seeks to 
appropriate and dismantle the existing life-worlds of the Deccan artisans and their Kālamukha 
gurus. As we are committed to offering an account of premodern religion that is as equally 
invested in understanding the methods and practices that were constitutive of specific religious 
life-worlds as it is in the ends, real or aspirational, towards which such practices are deployed, 
considerable efforts will also be directed towards offering an account of Hemādri’s textual and 
exegetical practices—the assemblage methods out of which he builds the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi. In this spirit, each of these chapters inculcates in the reader the specific 
modes of reasoning that the Caturvargacintāmaṇi was engineered to produce in those who 
studied it as a part of the process of the mass professionalization of a new cadre of Brāhmaṇa 
religious authorities of various degrees of erudition. At the same time, they also repeatedly 
demonstrate the fundamental discontinuity between Hemādri’s micro- and macro-textual 
interpretive choices and those made by his predecessors within Dharmaśāstra discourse. In 
chapter 9, particular attention will be paid to the writings of Hemādri’s most important 
antecedent, to which the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s repertoire of primary source texts is much 
indebted, the twelfth-century nibandhakāra Lakṣmīdhara, whose Kṛtyakalpataru is the earliest 
74 
extant work of dharmanibandha. By juxtaposing Lakṣmīdhara’s own parallel treatments of 
philanthropy (dāna) and institutionalization (pratiṣṭhā), which in both cases are much more 
deferent to the independent nature of the values that animate other life-worlds, the 
ideologically and socially innovative nature of Hemādri’s reimagined “Brāhmaṇism” will be 
brought into sharper relief. 
While in chapter 9 our chief focus had been on attending to Hemādri’s disruptive 
interventions into the preexisting realities of the western Deccan, with chapter 10, “Why I am 
So Clever, Why I Write Such Excellent Books, and What I Did to the Gods: Hemādri 
Reimagines Brāhmaṇical Thought,” our attention shifts to making sense of the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s reimagining of the world of Sanskrit śāstra, especially in terms of its 
hyper-ethicalized, theistic and devotionalized recasting of the values that animate Hindu law. 
Again, such an investigation necessarily entails seeking to understand both “what” extra- 
textual aims Hemādri is trying to achieve through his work as well as “how” he makes use of 
specific textual practices that involve the incorporation and reconstitution of inherited textual 
resources and preexisting hermeneutical strategies often in new imaginative ways. 
Our initial focus is the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s iconoclastic theorization of a 
Dharmaśāstra discourse that is not concerned with the usual questions of the duties specific to 
particular varṇas and āśramas, but is instead invested in robustly theorizing a universal 
(sāmānya) dharma, whose general contours are applicable in all contexts and to which all 
human agents are subject. While in the previous chapter we had focused on how this conceptual 
architecture is used to systematically delegitimize and dismantle the existing institutional and 
theological norms that organized the western Deccan while at the same time reshuffling the 
labor force in a manner that lead to an immediate redistribution of resources to the detriment 
75 
of non-Brāhmaṇas, here we consider the theology of the universalization of a nascent Hindu 
dharma on its own terms. Envisioned as a form of ethicalized natural law in a manner that has 
precious few Indic antecedents, the dharma theology of Hemādri places all human beings 
under the same shared norms, whose adjudication is conveniently confined to a new social 
agent, the Smārta Brāhmaṇa Dharmaśāstrin who must have also mastered the canons of 
Advaita Vedānta. Iconoclastically, aligned with proffering an account of shared moral reality 
amounting a shared human nature, for the first time in the history of prescriptive Brāhmaṇical 
śāstra, Hemādri offers a vigorous and learned defense of the legitimacy of non-twice-born 
soteriological aspirations. Intervening in ongoing discussions within Pūrva and Uttara 
Mīmāṃsā, Hemādri asserts that, despite their lack of direct access to the Śruti, Śūdras and 
women can indeed achieve liberation. Moreover, the methods for doing so, albeit using a canon 
of internally diversified Purāṇic sources that have to be interpreted in a special manner, are 
structurally analogous and functionally equivalent to the inquiry processes in orthodox 
Vedānta. This is to say, Hemādri emerges as the earliest recoverable articulator of some of the 
defining features of the instantiation of Hinduism in the colonial era imagination, namely, the 
apparent inclusion of all Indian subjects across caste lines within a shared religious framework 
governed by the same religious authorities and the positing of all of the varieties of Indian 
religious textuality as expressing a single shared worldview and unitary intentionality indebted 
to the tradition of Advaita Vedānta. 
Such an inclusivist intervention in what for many modern readers might seem to be the 
relatively low-stakes world of aspirational soteriology is not merely a passing eccentricity, but 
a defining feature of Hemādri’s discourse as a whole. As will become evident in the case 
studies that follow, quite unlike with the dharma norms of classical legal traditions, in a radical 
76 
break from his predecessors, the theology and presuppositions of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi are 
those of quotidian, common sense, everyday Indian religion. For the first time in the history of 
the learned traditions, this ethos and its aims is articulated and defended against its scholastic 
objectors in the language of high śāstra. In a sense, at the very moment that he is taking away 
the real-world authority of ordinary people to internally manage their own religious affairs 
without resorting to an intermediary from outside the community, Hemādri goes to enormous 
trouble to affirm what was already obvious to ordinary people, namely, that they lived in a 
world that was really full of gods and spirits who had to be fed, attended, and appeased, that 
successful navigation of these matters bestowed benefits in the present and hereafter, and that 
ritual grounded in scripture was the means for making that happen. Our own study of this 
dimensions of his interpretive program will attend to the opening chapter of the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s division on occasional religious observances (Vratakhaṇḍa), which 
offers for the first time in the history of Indian thought a representation of a “big tent” 
Hinduism as well as the theistic realist theorization of the feeding of the ancestors, treated not 
as a scholastic abstraction but as an actual affect laden engagement with embodied and 
disembodied entities, contained within the Śrāddhakhaṇḍa. Both of these elements are then 
read in relation to their marked utter discontinuity with any recoverable antecedents contained 
within the scholastic mainstream. Building upon our discoveries in the preceding chapter, what 
comes into focus is that both the Smārta values Hemādri seeks to inculcate and the conceptual 
strategies he uses to reimagine his sources represent a radically new kind of “Brāhmaṇical 
normativity” that the Seuṇa Yādava state seeks to instantiate a disseminate into the wider world 
through the mass training of a new sort of Brāhmaṇa religious authority. 
77In the final portions of the chapter, through examining and even regionalizing the key 
antecedents of the dharmanibandha discourse that Hemādri so capaciously makes his own, the 
insights we have recovered from our close readings will be placed into a wider socio-historical 
context. We will see that such a broad-based historical perspective once again speaks to the 
relative marginality even within the wider purview of eleventh- and twelfth-century north 
Indian Dharmaśāstra of much that to our author holds most sacred. In particular, the chapter 
will conclude by rendering transparent that the north Indian nibandhakāra Lakṣmīdhara shares 
with his successor neither his valorization of personalist Vedānta as the crowning achievement 
of Indic thought nor his investment in devotional theology. These observations in turn will 
prepare us for the final chapter in our study, which will take as its focus precisely that peculiar 
marriage of non-dual Vedāntic philosophical reasoning with affective devotionalism, the 
articulation of which, though already evident in the Caturvargacintamāṇi, comes to play a far 
more consequential role in the final stage of Hemādri’s intellectual life. 
Finally, chapter 11, “Staging Devotional Advaita in Thirteenth-Century Maharashtra: 
Possession, Poetics, and the Anxiety of Influence,” offers the first account within Western 
scholarship of Hemādri’s Vedāntic theistic devotionalism as it is expressed in his other great 
and equally influential contribution to Sanskrit scholastic traditions, the Muktāphala and 
Kaivalyadīpikā. This is the seminal work of the discourse of bhaktiśāstra, in which the 
theology of bhaktirasa to which so many early modern Vaiṣṇava traditions are deeply indebted 
finds its initial articulation. What this chapter aims to make plain is that main interpretive 
context for making sense of Hemādri’s theological commitments as well as many of the key 
intellectual strategies and conceptual models he will deploy in breathing into being his own 
bhaktiśāstra arise from the very episteme of the Śaiva Age that Hemādri invests so much 
78 
energy in discrediting and deinstitutionalizing. This chapter thus offers both an introduction to 
the core arguments of Hemādri’s bhaktiśāstra, the Muktāphala and Kaivalyadīpikā, while at 
the same time reading the text—which on the surface offers commentary on select verses from 
the Bhāgavata Purāṇa—as a sustained polemical and dialogical engagement with this 
preceding knowledge system. We will see that while Hemādri draws upon a range of textual 
resources originating in the elite milieu of the Sanskrit cosmopolis and its poetic traditions, his 
core conceptual resources and reoccurring problematics are directly appropriated from or the 
product of critical engagement with what are essentially Śākta knowledge systems. 
We will begin by briefly locating the counterintuitive confluence of ambiguously 
philosophical non-dualism and the discourse of devotion within the early goddess adjacent 
traditions of the Mantramārga. We will then demonstrate that, while absent from the Bhāgavata 
Purāṇa, both the central concern of the latter half of the Muktāphala—namely, theologizing 
bhaktirasa, as well as a key part of the organizational framework that orders the first half of 
Hemādri’s text, a particular framing of the opposition between rule governed ritual, 
spontaneity, and a theology of direct affective experience—find their earliest recoverable 
articulation in the writings of the Trika exegetes, especially Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta. 
With these insights in mind, we then turn to a close reading of the Muktāphala and 
Kaivalyadīpikā’s discourse on bhaktirasa. By attending to its inheritances from the traditions 
of Sanskrit poetics, what will be revealed is that while Hemādri makes an essentially 
instrumentalist use of Alaṃkāraśāstra tradition, the real problematics that animate this part of 
the work are best accounted for as emerging out of critical dialogical engagement with Śākta 
values and Śākta critiques. We will also begin to examine how Hemādri reframes his new 
valorization of affectively charged “direct religious experience,” so that it ceases to be the 
79 
provenance of an elite of adepts, while at the very same time “authentic religious experience” 
is decoupled from questions of adhikāra. This is to say, we will tell the story of how bhakti 
becomes a universalizing social force precisely as the status “being a bhakta” ceases to index 
juridical difference or to correspond to social and material power within the transactional 
world. 
Having made sense of Hemādri’s devotional theology and been introduced to some of 
its sociological implications, we then examine the nature of Hemādri’s theism. While 
substantively indebted to the Bhāgavata itself, Hemādri’s theorization of the nature of a 
personal god expands upon and even diverges from its core understandings. We will thus delve 
in some detail into the nuts and bolts of Hemādri’s theistic—even materialist—non-dual 
Vedānta, an important resource for later scholastic traditions which has never been addressed 
in an academic publication. Reconstructing our author’s core arguments will render transparent 
the eccentricity of his Advaita philosophy vis-à-vis our normative perceptions of contemporary 
scholastic Advaita Vedāntic discourse. At the same time, it will reveal the essential consonance 
of his Vedānta with the strikingly similar and equally unfamiliar ontological and 
epistemological models present within an array of literature composed in old Marathi, 
including the contemporary writings of Cakradhar and the late-twelfth-century Vivekasindhu 
of Mukundarāja. What will emerge from our explorations is an alternative localized history 
that speaks to the flourishing as the early medieval period draws to a close of a heavily 
devotionalized Deccani Vedānta growing out of older Śākta traditions. That this value system 
appears to have represented a widespread and popular theological tradition even in the absence 
of the hegemonical identification of Brāhmaṇical tradition with Vedānta as a knowledge 
system poses a serious challenge to our normative narratives about the Brāhmaṇization and 
80 
Vedāntization of “popular” religion. Hemādri’s intellectual project as a Vedāntin in fact 
suggests that we begin to think seriously about the “popularization of Brāhmaṇical religion” 
as playing a pivotal role in the history of the elevation of Vedāntic traditions. The chapter will 
then conclude by looking at the sociological implications of Hemādri’s new bhaktiśāstra, 
making sense of his appropriation and subversion of his Śākta antecedents in a manner that 
calls for a more general reappraisal of the concrete real-world implications of bhakti as a social 
form and its complex and occluded relationship to the life-worlds of the early medieval Śaiva 
Age. 
Some Necessary Aporia 
Map is not territory,43 if only for the very practical reason that the land we chart is vast, dense, 
and heavy, while humans are small, more immediately finite, and have a tendency to break 
43As Jonathan Z. Smith himself acknowledges, his famous dictum “map is not territory” is adapted from the writings of Alfred Korzybski where it serves the purpose of helping to introduce “a general theory of semantics.” What has gone unnoticed, however, is that Smith appropriates Korzybksi in the service of making an argument that is effectively antithetical to the worldview that this statement was originally intended to express, and that his revision and very deliberate elisions have serious methodological implications for the scholar of religion, particularly one who embraces a constructivist program. In this regard, the passage is itself worth attending to: 
“Let us take some actual territory in which cities appear in the following order: Paris, Dresden, Warsaw. . . . If we were to build a map of this territory and place Paris between Dresden and Warsaw. . . we should say that the map was wrong, or that it was an incorrect map or that the map has a different structure from the territory. If, speaking roughly, we should try, in our travels, to orient ourselves by such a map, we should find it misleading. It would lead us astray, and we might waste a great deal of unnecessary effort. In some cases, even, a map of wrong structure would bring actual suffering and disaster, as, for instance, in a war, or in the case of an urgent call for a physician. 
Two important characteristics of maps should be noticed. A map is not the territory it represents, but if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness. If the map could be ideally correct, it would include, in a reduced scale, the map of the map. . . . If we reflect upon our languages, we find that at best they must be considered only as maps. A word is not the object it represents; and languages exhibit also this peculiar self-reflexiveness, that we can analyse language by linguistic means. . . . If words are not things, or maps are not the actual territory, then, obviously, the only possible link between the objective world and the linguistic world is found in structure, and structure alone. The only usefulness of a map or a language depends on the similarity of structure between the material world and the map-languages. If the structure is not similar, then the traveller or speaker is led astray, which, in serious human life-problems, must become always eminently harmful. If the structures are similar, then the empirical world becomes ‘rational’ to a potentially rational being, which means not more than that verbal, or map-predicated characteristics, which follow up on the linguistic or map- structure, are applicable to the empirical world.” Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity; An Introduction to Non-

when they attempt to bear herculean loads. Since art is long and life is short, we regrettably 
have to make painful choices. Perhaps the most egregious omission from our exploration of 
the western Deccani canons excavated over the next two thousand pages is the deliberate 
bracketing out of a base reality that, though less familiar to Western academics, would be 
immediately evident to scholars from Karnataka and Maharashtra. Succinctly, a plurality of 
the specific sites and types of social spaces we will be exploring were also either 
simultaneously inhabited by Yāpanīya and Digambara Jain communities or at least regularly 
Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics (Brooklyn: International Non-Aristotelian Library Publishing Company, 1958), 58–61. 
In precisely the same manner that we will grapple throughout the present work with the use and transposition of South Asian textual sources into new contexts, it is worth taking a moment to think through how our discipline’s reception of this idea departs from the message expressed at its point of origin, especially given that for generations of scholars in Religious Studies Smith’s dictum has become something of a catechism. Just as Smith advocates in his own work when studying other people’s reimaginings of the archive, it is important to attend to what Smith has deliberately excluded from his representation of his sources. 
To be blunt, for all his eccentricities—which extend to claiming that the way to save the world is to reimagine grammar so as to remove its capacity for excess metaphysics—Alfred Korzybski is adamant that mapmaking is an ethically charged act in which the craftsman has a particular responsibility regarding the accurate representation of the sources. In this regard at least, it is Smith, and not Korzybski, that is radically eccentric. Furthermore, Korzybski argues that map making is not simply an act of play or a creative process, but, insomuch as it is meaningful, aims at reproducing, albeit at a different scale, “a similar structure” to that which organizes the territory it is mapping. 
When Smith redeploys the term “mapping,” all of these dimensions—ethical imperatives, notions of faithfulness, a test of efficacy, functionalist commonalities—have been very deliberately denuded. Indeed, one can make a plausible case that it is this core interpretive move, the claim that “maps are all we have,” that lies at the heart of Smith’s hermeneutic. When we juxtapose Smith with his sources, what becomes palpably clear is that his notion of maps as something other than modeling reimagines academic practice into a, dare I say it, a sui generis modality. Virtually nobody else (fantasy novelists maybe?)—not even the most stringent Neo-Kantian—uses “map” or “mapping” in this manner, as the act of drawing up schemata regarding places and territories that they not only do not believe exist but that they do not believe have any underlying structural principles or content outside of cartographical convention. This is to say, while we might well treat religion as “a distinct mode of human creativity, a creativity which both discovers limits and creates limits in human existence” where what we study “is the variety of attempts to map, construct, and inhabit such positions of power through the use of myths, rituals, and experience of transformation,” but in doing so we must recognize that there is a fundamental dissimilitude between how the Smithian academic study of religion perceives the act of mapping as an almost non-consequentialist form of “time-pass,” and the markedly different sense of obligation charged activity that animates how many of the people we label religious set out to document, order, and bring into alignment the world of experience with inherited imaginaries in the service of individual and community aims.

participated alongside Jains in overlapping life-worlds in the context of trade, the construction 
of infrastructure and temples, participation in courtly cultures, and intellectual scholasticism. 
Indeed, the usual way of telling stories about pre-Islamic Deccani courtly cultures on the basis 
of their literary traditions tends to lead to the representation, at least equally inaccurate, of the 
greater Cālukya world, where the ruling powers typically had at least one Jain spouse and 
liberally patronized Jain intellectual and literary production, as a largely Jain imaginary. In the 
service of telling a coherent story about the making of Brāhmaṇical knowledge, we have made 
the counterintuitive choice, namely, of demoting the Jain contribution to a walk-on part. This 
approach also certainly cannot be justified on purely thematic grounds. Indeed, the very 
hallmark of Digambara Jain theology during this period is precisely its presentation of perhaps 
the most robust account of epistemological site- and community-specific pluralism to emerge 
from the sub-continent and thus is in a certain sense a natural fit for the story we have been 
telling. Instead, it should be taken as tactic, a form of epistemic bracketing that permits us to 
home in on and reconstruct one set of neglected life-worlds at the expense of another. 
My excuse, such as it is, is that do the job properly would take another half a decade 
and a thousand pages. It would entail mastering a poetic canon in Apabhraṃśa and high literary 
Kannada only cursorily engaged with by the Western academy and traditions of vernacular 
śāstra, to say nothing of a multilingual commentarial tradition on Digambara doctrinal works, 
much of it composed in the western Deccan during the very period we have been exploring, 
that has yet to be the focus of any serious systematic study. Each of these would then have to 
be examined at the level of “the textual how,” grappled with from the inside out in terms of 
their compositional and assemblage practices, a task for which the existing secondary literature 
has yet to prepare us. Fortunately, the reader interested in such conceptual programs can get a 
83 
taste of two out of three of these domains of inquiry by consulting two equally ground-breaking 
erudite dissertations. Sarah Pierce Taylor’s44 Aesthetics of Sovereignty: The Poetic and 
Material Worlds of Medieval Jainism as well as her subsequent publications look at the 
intersection of the deeply influential literary production of Digambara communities in the 
ninth- and tenth-century western Deccan and the theorization of royal power through poetic 
imaginaries under the Rāṣṭrakūṭa kings. This literary focus is nicely complemented by Eric 
Gurevitch’s Everyday Sciences in Southwest India, an excavation of the history of systematic 
scientific knowledge production in the fields of animal husbandry, bureaucratic mathematics, 
erotics, weather prediction and the treatment of disease as primarily carried out by Jain 
polymaths, aligned with courts of the Rāṣṭrakūṭas and Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas, who adapt the writing 
of śāstra into the Kannada language, producing a substantial and influential corpus of literature 
that here receives scholarly attention for the first time.45 Sadly, we still await a comparably 
lucid and thorough treatment of the multilingual theological traditions of the Digambara and 
Yāpanīya Jains of a sort that would make possible a constructive querying of the core 
problematics we will be exploring relative to these canons. Nevertheless, it is my intention to 
more explicitly integrate a constructive response to these two productive avenues of inquiry 
into the published monograph that will emerge out of the present work. 
Other paths not taken can be addressed much more concisely. At a relatively early stage 
in the composition of this study, I became aware of the considerable relevance of the “other” 
other Mīmāṃsā, the tradition of Prabhākara, to a comprehensive understanding of the 
mechanics of pluralist thinking within classical Brāhmaṇical śāstra as well as its concrete

influence on later Dharmaśāstra exegetical traditions. In the absence of any comprehensive 
study of the Prābhākara tradition from intellectual historians on which the present work might 
build, this task, alas, is simply beyond my abilities. It is hoped that the eventual emergence of 
such studies, preliminary work on which is currently being undertaken by several researchers, 
will eventually make it possible to fill in this crucial piece of the puzzle. 
In contrast, with regard to conversations that might more readily be contributed to in 
some detail, the present work also makes it abundantly clear, on the basis of a wealth of textual 
and especially material cultural evidence, the necessity of composing a replacement to David 
Lorenzen’s classic study of the Kālamukhas so as to orient general readers in Religious Studies 
to this specific and ubiquitous religious imaginary.46 Such a work, building on the foundation 
provided by several chapters in the present text, needs to be organized around a concrete 
periodization and regionalization of our evidence for Kālamukhas as major social actors both 
within their own domains and in relation to major political powers. This will entail, in the 
manner modelled here throughout, systematically matching unpublished or retranslated textual 
evidence with its built context. However, the project will demand substantial additional 
fieldwork, especially in Telangana and Andhra. In the absence of such efforts, it simply too 
early to craft the type of evidence driven synthetic narrative contextualizing the history of 
Kālamukha traditions as central social actors across the Deccan that the reader may well desire. 
For now, we will have to make do with a nebulous sense of Kālamukha institutions as 
increasingly engaging in the transmission of a wide but underdefined array of Tantric 
46Lorenzen’s work remains the most substantial treatment of both the Kāpālikas and Kālamukhas in monograph form and does invaluable work assembling and then engaging with important previously unexamined sources. As we will see, however, advances in our understanding of the history of Śaiva and Śākta-Śaiva traditions have rendered much of the work obsolete and as the present work makes plain, one of its core arguments, namely, that the Kālamukhas were an unobjectionable orthodox Brāhmaṇical Śaiva community whose supposed transgressive nature is polemical slander is simply no longer tenable.

85 
knowledge. A similar case holds true for this work’s sadly overgeneralized designation of 
“Śākta traditions” in the Deccan, which begs to be refined by a filling in the details on the basis 
of more particularized study of the specific Śākta Tantras whose composition can be located 
within the regions and periods under discussion. Even these efforts, however run up against 
the additional complication that I also see ample evidence for the existence throughout this 
period of non-Purāṇic, non-Tantric, and non-esoteric “Śākta” traditions with their own 
independent imaginaries which must also be studied and accounted for, especially through a 
judicious engagement with ethnographic evidence. Here again we must simply make do with 
an acceptance of the inherent polyvalence of the term, which, depending on audience, 
simultaneously has a number of discrete intended doctrinal referents. 
On Archives, Evidence, Tactics, and Ethics 
In lieu of a discussion of “method,” core dimensions of which have already been outlined in 
some detail while presenting an overview of the contents of the current work, it seems 
warranted to delineate and justify some of the atypical choices that organize the present 
investigation. At least from my perspective, Ending the Śaiva Age aims for a persistent archival 
originality joined at the hip with a relentless practice of source criticism, incorporating what 
the scholar of indigenous religions Sam Gill has helpfully framed as “story tracking.”47 The 
47Gill, a student of both Eliade and Smith, anchors his articulation of this method around a study of how Eliade, in The Sacred and the Profane as well as in Australian Religions: An Introduction, but also Smith, in his own source critical critiques of Eliade’s use of Aboriginal materials, both made highly selective even distortive use of materials concerned with narratives about the Numbakulla world pole they found in the archives in the service of making theoretical arguments specific to the Western academy of their day and largely not present in their sources. Gill takes this observation as a point of departure for studying the assemblage process and life-worlds of the original Western colonial era investigators grappling with attempting to document and understand Aboriginal religion for their own purposes upon which both Eliade and Smith rely. Gill arrives at a new valuation for the necessity of first looking at each selective engagement on its own terms and then studying the points of interlap and deliberate omissions among the second-order receptions that make up our sources in the service of piecing together what we can of the shared reality to which they might refer while also appreciating each reception as a form of play or experimentation. See: Sam D. Gill, Storytracking: Texts, Stories, and Histories in Central Australia (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998); Sam D. Gill, The Proper Study of Religion: Building on Jonathan Z. Smith (New York: Oxford University Press, 2020). 
86 
latter feature is directed both at the primary sources themselves as well as the existing 
historiography. 
Assuming one treats distinct inscriptions as well as discrete subdivisions within 
particularly long multi-section works (often read from manuscript), the present study 
incorporates translations and text-critical work conducted in classical Sanskrit, Aiśa, old 
Kannada, and old Marathi from roughly 150 distinct sources. The vast majority of the texts 
under consideration have received virtually no attention within the academic study of religion 
in South Asia. Quite a few of them are unpublished works read from manuscript or published 
in such obscure places on the subcontinent that they are effectively not in circulation. Few of 
these sources have been translated before. In particular, Ending the Śaiva Age incorporates 
extensive original textual work from palm leaf manuscript on the unpublished codex unicus I 
discovered of the Śivadharmavivaraṇa, the late eighth-century Śākta Pratiṣṭhā Tantra, the 
Piṅgalāmata’s chapters on vyākhyāna, śilpa, prāyaścitta, iconography, and pratiṣṭhā based on 
three distinct palm leaf manuscripts, two of them in Nepalese scripts, and reconstructs from 
the Nāgarī paper manuscripts I discovered substantial portions of the opening and closing 
chapters of the “lost” Tīrthakhaṇḍa of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi of Hemādri, as well as, again 
from paper Nāgarī manuscript, the “lost” unpublished opening chapter of the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s Sarvadevatāpratiṣṭhāpaddhati. This work also makes the first 
extensive use of the many sections of the multi-thousand page published edition of the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi, translating passages from all of its divisions and digesting its contents, 
such that it can be entered into the conversations of scholars of Indology and Religious Studies. 
A similar if less comprehensive effort is also made in regard to rendering the core conceptual 
logic of Hemādri’s Sanskrit Muktāphala and Kaivalyadīpikā and Mukundarāja’s late twelfth- 
87century old Marathi Vivekasindhu, the latter of which is made accessible to scholarly audiences 
for the very first time. 
Otherwise, the sources analyzed include inscriptions in range of registers and languages 
(Pāṇinian Sanskrit, vernacular Sanskrit, old Kannada, old Marathi), prose and verse kāvya, 
works on Sanskrit dramaturgy and poetics, Bhāṭṭa and Prābhākara Pūrva Mīmāṃsā, Advaita 
Vedānta, Nirukta, and classical Vedic exegesis, scribal training manuals, commentaries and 
treatises on Nyāya/Vaiśeṣika philosophy, Āyurvedic text and commentary, treatises on 
mathematics and astrology, Pratiṣṭhā and Śilpaśāstra, Śākta and Śaiva Tantra, Dharmasūtra, 
Dharmaśāstra, Dharmaśāstra commentary, non-Brāhmaṇa Dharmaśāstra, dharmanibandha, 
Nīti, and the pleasures of the royal court, as well as non-dual philosophical writings in old 
Marathi. In other words, we repeatedly think about discourse outside the boundaries of genre 
and disciplinarity (Western academic or otherwise), attending throughout to avenues that allow 
for the recovery of polyvocality in culture above and beyond the voices of a presumed 
Brāhmaṇical mainstream. Such an approach offers as a portrait of a dynamic and multifaceted 
Indian premodernity where Indian knowledge systems and the cultural realities out of which 
they emerge are no longer simply equated with classical śāstra composed in Sanskrit. 
Complementing this extensive multilingual textual study is a thorough engagement 
with the material culture of the western Deccan. Much of these materials are also previously 
unphotographed and undocumented, and I have discovered several previously undocumented 
spaces that have evaded scholars in India or whose significance has yet to have been 
recognized. By and large, most of these places have yet to have been incorporated into Western 
academic discussions. I have visited and documented over two-hundred field states located 
throughout coastal Maharashtra, the region around Aurangabad, the border lands near Gujarat, 
88 
Marathawada, and the Konkana, distinctive cultural regions throughout both northern, central, 
and southern Karnataka, eastern Telangana as well as the parts of Andhra close to the eastern 
Karnataka border. On the basis of this broader archive, I have then selected for incorporation 
some key highlights drawn from this fieldwork offering particularly compelling case studies, 
especially privileging instances where we can match in situ inscriptions to material culture 
from the same period, sites of particular historical significance in terms of their premodern 
institutional cultures, archives that can be readily related to parallel cases, as well as 
particularly evocative and transparent presentations of Śākta material culture still in situ that 
have yet to be the subject of study. It is important to recognize, however, that from my 
perspective these specific case studies are typically expressions of more general sociological 
and discursive patterns that were equally in evidence at other field sites visited that were not 
incorporated into this study. In part, the extensive treatments of material culture within the 
present work, which often offer us examples of similar phenomena at geographically distanced 
locations, aim to demonstrate that the unfamiliarity of much of these materials should not be 
treated as evidence of their eccentricity but is in fact indicative of our broader failure at 
grappling with the lived realities that actually animated the early medieval Deccan. 
Nevertheless, such a compilation of new and interesting materials would merely 
amount to a colossal and rather tedious data dump were it not be accompanied by a range of 
complementary approaches, extending above and beyond philological practices, to what is 
effectively “source criticism.” As this introduction has repeatedly suggested, at the heart of 
this investigation is a self-conscious decision to treat both texts and objects as “made” things 
and then to try, in each case, to the limits of one abilities, to see how they were put together. 
When it comes to texts, such efforts begin with a critical engagement with citational practices, 
89 
whether involving the direct invocation of a named authority or indirect allusion. In every 
instance, particularly when it comes to the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, whether or not such 
investigations were incorporated into this study, it has proven useful, when a work being cited 
is still extant or at least invoked in other texts, to consult the original primary source. 
These efforts have been greatly enhanced through the application of the methods of the 
digital humanities, entailing regular GREP searches of an archive comprised of my own 
extensive private library of personal e-texts, complemented by resources from GRETIL and 
the Muktabodha Indological Library, though hard copies of many editions of Sanskrit works 
have also been consulted. In each instance, it has been my practice to programmatically reflect 
upon the wider context in which the specific citation is embedded, with the aim of determining 
whether it is being accurately represented, strategically and selectively deployed, or even 
outright falsified or reinvented. A similar approach, attending to inherited arguments and the 
use of particular terms of art, has been deployed when it comes to non-direct citation. This is 
to say, each scrap of text has been thought about in relation to what can be readily reconstructed 
of its intertexts. 
An analogous approach has also been implemented when it comes to the study of 
inscriptions. Rather than treating these written expressions, much as if they were free standing 
citations, as self-contained realities, in all but a handful of instances I have made a point of 
visiting the site where they preserved in situ, relating them to the surrounding landscape and 
material culture. Often this simple choice radically undercuts the canonical interpretation of 
these documents when read as messages removed from context. Particular works of material 
culture, whether individual sculptures or temple complexes, have also been treated in a similar 
manner. Each is seen not just as freestanding discrete representation, but is instead “read” 
90 
relationally in connection with the wider environs, such as other objects or nearby temples, or 
in regard to parallel similar instantiations at other locations. In the case of early modern 
religious institutions and their imaginaries, considerable insights have also been gleaned by 
attending to their reception among living communities on the ground to whom I wish to express 
his profound gratitude for their knowledge, time, and hospitality. Though only select elements 
have been incorporated directly into the present work, either directly or through the 
interpretation of friends and assistants on the ground, my fieldwork has frequently involved 
many hours of engaging with the various inhabitants of the sites I have visited, especially 
religious authorities and practitioners committed to now mostly localized living traditions. 
Such passing anthropological vignettes not only enliven the analysis, but have frequently 
proved pivotal to helping me make sense of the deep pre-histories of patterns of social 
affiliation. 
The application of a similar rigor in source criticism to the secondary literature, in 
contrast, is much more likely to be met with greater resistance. Within the Western academy, 
relatively little work, located within particularized space and time, has been directed towards 
the specific archives of the western Deccan with which we are primarily concerned. That being 
said, the general literature on “early medieval India” is quite extensive, as is that on epigraphy. 
Though I have invested the time in reading a plurality of these sources, starting from the mid- 
nineteenth century onward, also examining many of its analogues in Hindi and Marathi, by 
large they will make only the occasional explicit appearance in the present work. The 
justification is either this historiography is concerned primarily concerned with a specific 
region, especially Tamil Nadu under the Cōḻas, where the prevailing material and political 
circumstances are hyper-particular but have nonetheless been analogically extended to other 
91 
regions, or, in the case of more general models, a careful examination of the evidentiary basis 
for core claims contained therein reveal they leave something to be desired. To be quite frank, 
to the detriment of the field, especially when it comes to the study of inscriptions in the service 
of writing history with a broader focus, there is a cottage industry that has made whole careers 
out of “reading” strangely relevant concepts and projected ideas out of often very boring 
documentary records or very complicated Sanskrit discourse. Such interpretive choices are 
particularly common when the “larger” meaning of the actual text at hand is basically 
indeterminate, utterly uninteresting to the academy, or substantial portions of the record are 
borderline unreadable. These same examples, often receiving further embellishment, then get 
recycled into the standard secondary source treatments concerned with “characterizing” 
dynasties, recovering the ideological basis for bodies of literature, or “telling us” about the 
various facets of premodern Indian cultural life, after which they are imported without critical 
scrutiny into Western scholarship that is concerned with other topics and concepts.48 With sad 
48A single example of how these games of scholarly telephone become constitutive of entire historiographies full of just so-stories with no firm evidentiary basis will suffice for our purposes. Beginning in the sixth century, a community called the Bōyas appears in a range of epigraphical and literary sources from Karnataka and greater Andhra, often in a surprising range of capacities, from serving as Brāhmaṇas, to living in temples where they tend to ritual matters, to bestowing gifts of cows. Especially as this community has a range of descendants and appears also in the colonial era anthropological historiography, where they are usually identified as a borderline criminal caste, dividing their time between hunting, petty brigandry, and serving as soldiers, with some select communities acting as Poligars, independent lords with their own forts. Making sense of the multiplicity of occupations and self-understandings of the community through rigorous historical work is clearly a worthwhile task. 
What we find in the secondary literature, in contrast, is a very different picture, which can be distilled down into the following elements. Several inscriptions from the fifteenth to sixteenth century, all issued from the same general region in Nellore district, refer, it seems, to the toponym Bōyavihāradēśamu, without any further details as to its significance. Some others use a similarly unspecified phrase Bōyavidu. Importantly, said toponyms seem never to appear in the classical inscriptional record. There are also a large number of sentences, in both Kannada and Telugu, which incorporate both the noun bōya and variations on the lexeme kŏṭṭam or kŏṭṭa. Now it is true that kŏṭṭam as a noun in Dravidian languages can mean either fort or cattle-pen. In inscriptions, however, a far more common occurrence is the formally similar but semantically unrelated lexeme kŏṭṭa most commonly found as part of a past tense verbal formation. One thing that seems to be happening in the secondary literature is that some of our authors seem to keep conflating these two terms, sometimes melding together the two unrelated lexemes into the synthetic compound Bōyakŏṭṭa/Bōyakŏṭṭam not present in the texts and that is grammatically illegible. 
92 
These seemingly extraneous stray details should be kept in mind when one looks at a passage such as the following, which stands near the end of many decades of “reception”: 
“Almost from the time of the foundation of the Vengi Kingdom, the Eastern Calukyas appear to have cast their greedy eyes on the Boyakottams. The very second king in the line, Jayasimhavallabha (A.D. 643-673) issued his Pedammadali plate from Udayapura, identified by scholars with Udayagiri in Neliore district evidently from the Boyaviharadesa. Jayasaimha took the proud title vajasiddh (scorer of victory) and his Polimburu plates were issued from Vijayaskandhavara (victorious war camp). But he was silent about the name of the king on whom he waged the war and scored the above victory. However, it be surmised that in his efforts to expand his kingdom southwards, Jayasimha came into conflict with the Boyas, defeated their chief, but was silent about his name as he was too insignificant for him to be mentioned. With this victory of Jayasimha, the Vengi Kingdom extended southwards into the very heart of the Boyakottams.” B. S. L. Hanumantha Rao, “The Boyas in Medieval Andhra Society,” in Dr. Venkataramanayya’s Commemoration Volume, ed. R. Subrahmanyam (Hyderabad: The Government of Andhra Pradesh, 1987), 77–92. 
Essentially, what has happened here is that on the basis of lexemes of radically underdetermined significance present in documentary records from a nearly thousand years after the period being analyzed, Hanumantha, following in the footsteps of many generations of scholars, presumes the existence of an Ur-Bōya homeland and then treats the occupation of said geographical locality in the seventh century as the originary moment of the dispersal of the Bōyas. This is decision is made notwithstanding the core reality that the Sanskrit language Pedammadali plate from Udayapura nowhere refers to Bōyas, kŏṭṭam or kŏṭṭa, let alone Bōyavihāradēśa. 
On the basis of the nonexistent lexeme kŏṭṭam, which again appears nowhere in his primary source, he then presumes to describe this totally imaginary place as defined by forts (twelve of them in fact) controlled by the Bōyas and even suggests that the existence of said forts, about which again we know nothing, in the wholly imaginary territory of the Bōyavihāradēśa, is the actual (though entirely unstated) impetus for the expansion of the Eastern Cāḷukya Empire into the region. This just so story is then itself used to make sense of the sudden emergence in the inscriptional record within this region of numerous śāsanas offered to social agents with the designation -bōya in their name. But in fact, the situation gets even more preposterous. For, drawing on a different strain of equally evidence-free scholarship, in trying to describe the culture of the bōyas, Hanumantha then takes the same lexeme kŏṭṭam, again treated as a noun, in yet another of its senses, namely, as a cowshed. On the basis of this discovery, we are then told, the Bōyas are identified with the community called the gŏllas, who are represented as cattle pastoralists in documentary records. The Bōyas themselves then are also cast as primarily “pastoralist herders,” notwithstanding the fact that there is zero ethnographic evidence for them carrying out this social role (though there is evidence for them as cattle rustlers and the inscriptional record itself points to them being recipients of donations of cows as a form of wealth). 
The end result is that, when the term surfaces in her sources, even as careful a scholar as Cynthia Talbot, while noting the incongruity, inherits certain problematic assumptions from this previous scholarship: “Herders (boyas) were the other prominent group of male donors at coastal Andhra's large temples and comprise the social category most closely linked with patronage of these sites. While they are similar to merchants and artisans in being more mobile and less bound to specific territory, the extent of the herder preference for the major temples is rather surprising. Indeed, practically no herders figure in inscriptions from the interior as either donors or trustees of livestock grants.” She later comments, “And the fact that the words gopa (the Sanskrit word for ‘cattle herder’) and golla (the Telugu equivalent of gopa) are used as synonyms of boya underlines the term's significance. The title boya referred to the occupation of herding, rather than to a particular community.” Cynthia Talbot, Precolonial India in Practice: Society, Region, and Identity in Medieval Andhra (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 59. 
As she observes in a related footnote, the only evidence available to her for equating the whole community of Bōyas with herders runs as follows. “Certain boyas are referred to as gopa in SII 4.1370, SII 10.284 and 333; boya and gollas are equated in SII 5.197.” At best, the evidence on hand (much of it located in terse fragments) indicates that a small subset of the Bōya community at three specific sites acted as pastoralists. The evidence for characterizing the whole community as such is simply the inherited hearsay of the historiography we just examined.

regularity, attempts to trace the evidentiary foundations of these assertions back to the primary 
sources culminate in the discovery that nothing like what was claimed is actually in the text, 
that key parts of the argument are based on irresponsible uses of folk etymology, or even, that 
the primary source invoked is purely imaginary. 
At the root of the issue are far too many professionals studying documentary records 
or works of śāstra without actually being able to read the languages in which they are 
composed. This is a problem that plagues the Kannada academy in particular, where the study 
of epigraphy as objects and the study of epigraphy as texts take place in separate departments 
and are the intended end result of two separate professionalization tracks. But it was also alas 
a feature of the “elite” Delhi-centric Indian academy of prior generations, which taught 
generations of students to think and write like Western academics while failing to ground such 
a study in a deep pedagogical engagement with the study of non-Western languages on their 
own terms that is necessary when working with primary sources. The end result is a vast and 
on the surface lucid historiography, seemingly much more accessible and informed than what 
emerged from the pen of scholars affiliated with regional universities who write in a less 
sophisticated idiom. The problem is that this discourse runs on the habitual cherry picking of 
a few words extracted out from premodern texts, which are then combined with vivid narratives 
serving some, often quite laudable, extra textual interest. Because they are only nominally 
related to the primary sources, the study of such efforts are largely not relevant to the 
understanding of the premodern past. After much time wasted, I have concluded it is often 
better to simply return to the primary sources on which this literature is so loosely based and 
read them for oneself. 
94 
A similar dilemma, namely, why are we so preoccupied with a meta-discourse that is 
basically only tenuously logically connected with the contents of the archive, is posed when it 
comes to the justifications for engaging with the enormous historiography debating rather 
worn-in-the-tooth scholarly metanarratives imported from early twentieth-century academia, 
such as the question of whether “early medieval India” warrants being categorized as “feudal.” 
The irony here is that outside of the study of India, this is a conceptual frame whose analytical 
utility has been seriously called into question. Here it is worth observing, before we even turn 
to the subcontinent, that among European medievalists, there is now a general consensus that 
feudalism, at least treated as a unitary social system, was never an actual on-the-ground reality 
but is itself a multilayered anachronistic synthetic scholarly fiction. Much as in the Austrio- 
German school of volkisch historiography,49 which sought out to theorize premodern modes of 
governance in the absence of the modern state, had proposed in the early twentieth century, 
close comparative studies of the documentary records concerned with transactional governance 
49While in the usual historiography the practice of social history is treated as a product of the French academy and seen as aligned with a left political perspective, there is an equally strong case for seeking its origins in volkisch traditions within the German academy, which despite an often dubious political agenda pioneered the sources driven approach to social history, incorporating the perspectives of multiple types of social agents, later equated with the Annales school, a state of affairs made all the more confusing by the deliberate post-war adoption of Annales-inspired technical frames as part of the process of de-Nazification. One of the most important works in this tradition is Otto Brunner, Land and Lordship: Structures of Governance in Medieval Austria, trans. Howard Kaminsky and James Van Horn Melton (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press,1984), which for the first time in modern historiography offers a robust case against methodological anachronism when it comes to the study of the past, imploring the necessity for excavating premodern conceptual and institutional frameworks out of the archive and then studying them on their own terms. Brunner’s key argument is that nineteenth- and twentieth-century academic discourses studying politics and law either project modern conceptualizations of state and society into the medieval past against the evidence of the archive or, in the absence of locating it in their sources, present the world of medieval Austria as an incoherent broken society existing on the edge of anarchy. In contrast, Brunner seeks to reconstruct two medieval political institutions and social forms that are alien to modern state thinking, namely, “the feud,” or the conventions that govern acts of targeted violence between lords, and the relationship between localized land rights and law including how taxation works in a world where it is inflected by logics of obligation that are not purely market driven. That, in a morbid parody of current trends that seek to continually recast one’s research to align it with topics of interest to the current zeitgeist and grant writing agencies, the second edition of Land and Lordship: Structures of Governance in Medieval Austria is rewritten so as to thoroughly align it with the political vision of the Nazi state, with the institution of the feud being used to normalize the violent actions of the SS, a process Brunner reverses in the third and fourth editions, is a cautionary tale that does not undercut the work’s considerable contributions to the practice of regional social history. 
95 
in medieval Europe unambiguously reveal the existence not of a single pattern of socio- 
economic relations, but of an enormous range of regionalized social and political forms that 
were constitutive of the lived landscape between the ninth and fourteenth centuries, virtually 
none of which correspond to post-eighteenth-century notions of state and society. Patterns of 
land ownership, modes of law, and questions of who has what sort of agency were not defined 
by a shared “medieval mindset,” but instead were largely a regional matter. What seems to 
have been determinative were such factors as localized political cultures with their own 
discrete pre-histories, topography, as well as the sort of labor involved in the cultivation of the 
local stable crop. In other words, to frame these observations in Marxist terms, the evidence 
does not support characterizing the “medieval” world as founded on a single shared mode of 
production. Just as significantly, key social identities, even when they have been apparently 
assigned the same labels, such as the scope and character of religious authorities like bishops 
or what it means to be a “king,” also varied enormously across region and time period. 
Succinctly, the distillation of these many variants into a single “medieval feudal system” 
proves an exercise in futility. 
Indeed, as the extraordinary Susan Reynolds has been arguing to great acclaim since 
the early 1990’s, in her seminal work (1994) Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence 
Reinterpreted and its more recent sequel (2012) The Middle Ages without Feudalism, even in 
regard to the French archives that formed the foundation of academic perceptions of medieval 
Europe as defined by a unitary and long-lasting system of land tenure founded on hereditarily 
inherited relations of vassalship to a lord, the very idea of a medieval world in which the central 
structural element of medieval social and economic relations are the institution of the fiefs and 
social roles of vassal and lord are barely in evidence in contemporary European primary 
96 
sources.50 In fact, such frames make their appearance many generations afterward in the second 
order reflections of early European Church historians and bureaucrats. In a complementary 
manner, Kathleen Davis has demonstrated rather convincingly in her monograph (2008) 
Periodization and Sovereignty: How Ideas of Feudalism and Secularization Govern the 
Politics of Time that the very ideas of “feudalism,” “the medieval,” or “a Feudal Europe” play 
essentially no part in the arguments and reflections of the medieval world itself.51 Instead of 
being a feature of the self-understanding of agents inhabiting the life-world it seeks to describe, 
Davis shows us that such conceptual frames initially begin to emerge in the sixteenth century 
as part of a juridical discourse and ultimately find their articulation in a form that is 
recognizable to us in the context of the early Enlightenment. 
To distill a much more complex argument, Davis argues that the “feudal” first emerges 
as a juridical concept (ius feudali) that sought to reconcile emerging canons of “modern” state- 
centric law, ultimately deriving in part from Roman common law, with traditions of regional 
“customary law” with their own prehistories. This is to say that the “feudal” was originally a 
50A good point of entry into this conversation and the surrounding historiography is Ian N. Wood, The Modern Origins of the Early Middle Ages (New York: Oxford University Press, 2016). For Susan Reynold’s seminal argument dismantling the very existence of feudal relations see: Susan Reynolds, Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996). For her work envisioning how a post-feudal model of the medieval might proceed, see Susan Reynolds, The Middle Ages without Feudalism: Essays in Criticism and Comparison on the Medieval West (Abingdon: Taylor and Francis, 2018), as well as the honorarium volume Pauline Stafford, Janet L. Nelson, Jane Martindale, and Susan Reynolds, Law, Laity and Solidarities: Essays in Honour of Susan Reynolds (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2020). For a fascinating archive-driven study of both knighthood and “strategic” voluntary serfdom in rural France, explicitly undercutting Marc Bloch, see: Dominique Barthélemy, The Serf, the Knight, and the Historian (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2009). For a localized case study in Frankish lands of the changing nature of political authority marked by the counterintuitive decline of the role of king and his personality, commencing in a new social formation within the medieval around the eleventh century, see Charles West, Reframing the Feudal Revolution: Political and Social Transformation between Marne and Moselle, c. 800–c. 1100 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2013). For the student of South Asian history, the most important takeaway is the futility of looking for feudal formations, based on European expectations, in the Indian archive that are no longer believed to have ever even existed in Europe. 51Kathleen Davis, Periodization and Sovereignty: How Ideas of Feudalism and Secularization Govern the Politics of Time (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012). In contrast to the prior historiography, this is a book that every scholar of South Asian religions and cultures should be required to read, for in its second half it explicitly dialogues with Indian historiography (albeit in a colonial and post-colonial context). 
97description not of the world of the past, but of the “contemporary” living pluralist traditions of 
non-state-centric practices. Parenthetically, this is to say that what Davis has reconstructed is 
a dynamic very similar to what we find in Dvivedi, where the existence within a single culture 
of two contradictory modes of legal reasoning is first recognized and then explained away 
through a process that accounts for the difference through temporalization. Davis then marshals 
an impressive body of evidence making the case that the feudalism we know takes shape within 
discourses justifying the expanded sovereignty of the modern state as well as the initial 
articulation of the colonial project. In situ, the imagining of the feudal or medieval aims not at 
a description of the past on its own institutional terms, but serves as a rhetorical foil or straw 
man, juxtaposing a chaotic, poor, and violent past defined by mass bondage with a glorious 
future of order and economic prosperity, made possible through the righteous subjugation of 
cultural and racial inferiors living in a global south that still adheres to archaic and barbaric 
feudal norms. In light of the evident anachronism of such frames to say nothing of their 
intended rhetorical impact in situ as tools aimed at delegitimizing the lived realities of non- 
Western world, maybe as scholars we should be asking ourselves: what do we really gain by 
saying early medieval India fits a Western-centric teleology now only of marginal interest even 
to medievalists? 
But in actuality, when we turn to the conversations that define specifically Indian 
exercises in periodization, the state of our historiography is such that there is even less cause 
for treating such discourses as the indispensable necessary backdrop for any further 
investigations against which our own contributions must be repeatedly justified. To be blunt, 
the situation in practice is that conversations about the Indian medieval are still basically 
inseparable from an ongoing critical evaluation, both within the Indian and American academy, 
98 
of the representations of non-Western societies as found in the writings of Marx and Engels as 
well as the history of their reception among Marxist intellectuals. The core problem here is 
that, as Davis demonstrates, Marx and Engels themselves inherited an articulation of European 
feudalism that had precious little to do with medieval European historical realities but is simply 
an adaptation of Enlightenment era polemical discourses intent upon the appropriation of the 
material and cultural resources of the past in the service of state-building. Ironically, these 
Marxist representations of the “medieval” simply perpetuate anachronistic metanarratives that 
were aimed at legitimizing the very modern Western state and capitalist mode of productions 
these authors so abhorred. In other words, these are lenses that were designed specifically to 
systematically devalue the past in the service of justifying the present. In the absence of critical 
self-reflexivity, the use of such tools virtually guarantees that one will be not be engaging with 
the contents of our archive on anything remotely like their own terms. 
Yet, even where the theoretical contributions of these nineteenth-century materialists 
more closely aligned to our archives in a manner that would allow for responsible cross cultural 
comparison, from the perspective of the twenty-first century, there is something antiquarian 
about how our discipline, under the guise of displaying erudition, is still clinging to this whole 
approach when it has ceased to be promoted in virtually any other corner of the academy. When 
even in India itself, traditional Marxist political agendas are basically irrelevant except along 
the margins, just why is it pertinent that any socially or historically rooted study first has to do 
due diligence and take up Marxist exegesis?52 Outside of intellectual historians who take 
52To be quite clear here, the objection here is not that Marxist inspired historiography, wherever we might find it, is intrinsically defective or a problem, but rather that when it comes to the study of premodernity, Indian Marxists by and large have not even integrated into their discourse the types of nuanced self-reflection found already in 1973 in the decidedly Marxist British historian EP Thompson’s exchange with his Polish counterpart Leszek Kolakowski, ironically in the service of seeking to refute Kolakowski’s turn towards what he sees as a much more philosophically inflected and “religion” centric Marxist imaginary. As the proudly atheist and materialist 
99 
political theory as their archive, why are we still avidly seeking to find out what Marx “really 
means” or emend his model to align with realities of the global south or directing our energies 
in a point-by-point refutation of the conceptual projects of the dwindling number of people 
with these agendas? 
Along similar rather sorry lines, why, in a world where even 1960 is closer in time to 
the World War I than it is to the present moment, must the discourse on Indian premodernity 
continue to take as its touchstone responding to an understanding of what constitutes the 
cutting edge of critical thinking about “Western feudalism” that is largely derived the writings 
of Marc Bloch (d. 1944) and the Soviet intellectual E.A. Kosminky (d. 1959)?53 Yes, both 
Thompson observes, talking about how one needs to study past ideological conceptualizations that one does not share: “I share and accept, in my work as an historian, your imaginative sympathy and intellectual respect for Christian forms, movements and ideas, which as you insist (and as Christopher Hill in this country has long insisted) must be studied in their own reality and autonomy, and not as figments of ‘false consciousness’ in which other more real and material interests were masked. . . . But your other proposition touches more closely on history: ‘religious consciousness. . . is an irreplaceable part of human culture, man’s only attempt to see himself as a whole—that is to say, as both object and subject.’. . . . There are many statements, of fact and of value, and of value disguised as fact, in that short statement. One may readily grant that the religious consciousness has been a part of past human culture. How far it has been present in all past cultures is a highly technical question, in answering which we would not only have to consult anthropologists but would also have to define the term ‘religious’ and decide how far any myth (whether supported or not by a doctrine, by priests or holy men, whether entailing or not notions of an after-life, rewards and punishments, etc.) may be defined as religion. The definition of ‘religious’ would clearly influence very largely our conclusions. . . . Point Two: If we accept that religious consciousness has been part of past human culture, then it follows that it has been irreplaceable, since we cannot replace any part of what is already past. . . . Three. If ‘irreplaceable’ is a statement not of fact but an imputation of value then it is a very different order of statement. . . . It is not because I wish to close the doors to imaginative sympathy towards forms of religious consciousness, whether past or present, but because I resent being drawn back into a fruitless argument upon terms which I reject, that I offer these objections.” E. P. Thompson, “An Open Letter to Leszek Kolakowski,” The Socialist Register 10 (1973): 14–17. 
Sadly, by and large, even when reading otherwise exceptionally intelligent scholarship, one searches in vain in the study of the early medieval Indian imagination for these nuanced kinds of insights, let alone the type of particularized reconstructions of specific elements and practices from early medieval life-worlds, first presented on their own terms and then subject to further critical reflection, that for my lifetime have been common when it comes to Western scholarship engaging with Western premodernity. 53Though his impact on the Western academy was much more limited, the Russian medievalist E. A. Kosminsky has had a determinative impact on how the Indian academy thinks about questions of social stratification within landed feudalism both in the context of scholarship and in terms of pedagogy within Indian schools. His key work, which was received as updated adaptation of Marc Bloch’s models, is Eugeny Alexeyevich Kosminsky, Studies in the Agrarian History of England in the Thirteenth Century, trans. Ruth Kisch (Oxford: B. Blackwell, 1956). For an examination of its impact in the 1950’s and 1960’s on Anglo-American historiography, 
100 
scholars made groundbreaking contributions and one can still benefit from reading their work, 
but given the many subsequent historiographical revolutions and advances in methodology 
within the study of Europe’s premodernities, the problematics they offer, which have been 
subject to nearly a century of critique, are hardly the most pertinent and pressing points of 
reference against which to compare the Indian medieval. The problem is that when we critique 
the theoretical foundations of the vast majority of secondary literature that tackles post- 
classical pre-conquest India in “historically responsible terms,” this is precisely the field on 
which we are made to fight our battles. 
These dynamics are all the more problematic as the key monograph, which self- 
consciously synthesizes and adapts Bloch’s and Kosminsky’s insights, to which the 
contemporary literature (including B. D. Chattopadhyaya,54 Kesavan Veluthat, even many of 
see T. H. Aston, ed., Landlords, Peasants and Politics in Medieval England (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987). For his considerably greater, albeit contested role in Soviet Bloc countries, some of which is relevant to traditions of Indian Marxism, see Yuri Valenskii, Academician E. A. Kosminsky and the Question of the Interpretation of the History of the Middle Ages in the Soviet School (Munich: Institut zur Erforschung der UdSSR,1954). 54A good point of orientation to the debates between different schools of thought in Indian historiography is Harbans Mukhia’s edited volume Harbans Mukhia, ed., The Feudalism Debate (New Delhi: Manohar, 2014), composed in response in part to the defense of Indian feudalism presented in D. N. Jha, ed. The Feudal Order: State, Society, and Ideology in Early Medieval India (New Delhi: Manohar, 2000). 
Chattopadhyaya, whose main archive is northwest India and Rajasthan, has produced probably the most sophisticated model to emerge from the debate. He incorporates important, though north India specific, critiques from B. N. S. Yadava’s work, which rejects the existence of feudalism in medieval India. B. N. S. Yadava, Society and Culture in Northern India in the Twelfth Century (Allahabad: Central Book Depot, 1973). In response, he articulates a modified model of what he calls “Sāmanta feudalism,” a political great chain of being involving multiple statuses of vassalage adapted to the Indian case. Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya, The Making of Early Medieval India (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997). Whatever its relevance to specific regions in northwestern India, where the specific titled roles the model refers to do in fact appear with some frequency in both the documentary records as well as in prescriptive texts, the inadequacy of his approach to Deccani archives is made evident in his case studies that attempt to fit his model to making sense of social and political change in rural Karnataka, which offer misreadings of the evidence presented. Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya, Aspects of Rural Settlements and Rural Society in Early Medieval India (New Delhi: Primus Books, 2017). 
Kesavan Veluthat, in contrast, represents a direct continuation of conservative traditions of Marxist historiography, redirected to treating south India (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka) as a unitary cultural and socio-political system whose different elements inhabit different progressive stages in a teleological account of social development, with the inner workings of that system explicated through exegetical engagement with Das Capital. Thus, in the introduction to The Early Medieval in South India, Veluthat defines the south Indian 
101 
medieval as comprised of six shared transregional developments: “1. transformations of an economy characterized by cattle-keeping and subsistence agriculture into one of wet rice cultivation and a considerable surplus, 2. replacement of simple exchange with the instituted process of trade and the subsequent development of urbanism, 3. transmutation of a relatively undifferentiated society into one divided sharply by caste and the consequent ‘casteization’ and peasantization of tribes, 4. acceptance of an organized religion with its ideas and institutions suited to the new economic and social order, 5. the emergence of the state to suit the newly evolved social order, and 6) a large number of other attendant developments, including the defining of the regional.” Kesavan Veluthat, The Early Medieval in South India (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2009), 14. 
Many of these features, even on the surface, represent a gross departure from historical circumstances. To take just one example, contrary to the first dimension of Veluthat’s progression, outside of the Cōḻa heartland, far from being a dietary staple whose production defined patterns of labor, rice cultivation has made a largely negligible contribution to the diet of people in most of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, and even much of Kerala. In all these places, within living memory, it was typically defined as a “rich man’s food,” while the staple was barley, millet, wheat, or gram, all of which demand different labor conditions, less intensive cultivation, and smaller labor pools. If you are working from a model where modes of production are determinative of cultural conditions, it is a virtual truism that “rice cultures” work differently from cultures defined around other crops. For recent discussions of such models, see for example T. Talhelm, “The Rice Theory of Culture,” Online Readings in Psychology and Culture 4, no. 1 (2022): 1–18. 
In more general terms, Veluthat’s programmatic projection of these features onto the archive serves the larger purpose of rendering south Indian cultural systems analyzable in terms of the principles outlined in Das Capital, often at the expense of overdetermining what is in his sources to fit his model. Thus, for example, in his essay “Labour Rent and Produce Rent: Reflections on the Revenue System under the Cholas” (Veluthat 2009, 100– 107), discarding as irrelevant five of the seven major modes of taxation actually found in Tamil sources, Veluthat limits his attention to two of them, veṭṭi and kaḍamai. The former refers to a mode of occasional community directed labor in lieu of financial payment, which with some variations was a ubiquitous feature of almost all premodern societies from the time of the emergence of writing. The latter comprises a variety of different forms of tax on land. In Veluthat’s hands, however, artificially separated from other tax modalities, these two are reframed as labor rent, “the primeval form in which the extraction of surplus value expresses itself” (Veluthat 2009, pg. 104), and produce rent. 
A single extended example in the author’s own words should suffice in showing the reader the limits of this sort of historiography. When we observe the change in the relative distribution of the proportion of these two rents over the centuries, what we discover, Veluthat asserts, is “that veṭṭi goes on decreasing as time progresses while kaḍamai goes on increasing. In other words, the incidence of labour rent is inversely proportional to that of produce rent. This is very significant. In the classical analysis of the genesis of ground rent in the capitalist mode of production, Karl Marx has characterized labour rent as the primeval form of surplus labour. Labour which is over and above what is absolutely essential for the maintenance and reproduction of the labourer himself is directly appropriated by the ‘owner’ of the means of production. On the other hand, in the case of rent in kind, it is the fruit of such surplus labour that is appropriated from the direct producer, which presupposes ‘a higher stage of civilization’. ‘The transformation of labour rent into rent in kind,’ however, writes Marx, ‘changes nothing from the economic standpoint in the nature of ground rent’. The mode of production, therefore, remains the same. Another significant feature is that veṭṭi continues to obtain at a lower frequency. . . . In other words, labour rent is not completely replaced by produce rent; the former exists even while the latter becomes the dominant form of surplus extraction. Even this is natural. . . according to Marx” (Veluthat 1988, 104–5). What the reader for whom Das Capital is not an inherent source of veridical authority is supposed to do with such analysis is an open question.

the writings of Manu Devadevan)55 continues to respond, namely, R. S. Sharma’s Early 
Medieval Feudalism,56 is not merely theoretically antiquated, but has effectively been 
disproven on his own evidentiary grounds. To put the matter simply, R. S. Sharma very 
candidly asserts that the origins of an imagined feudal India, following the collapse of the 
Gupta Empire, stem from the 1) decline of towns, 2) a decrease of the use of coins, and 3) the 
decay of long distance trade. These developments are seen as coinciding with a new cultural 
paradigm of state driven divesture through the granting of land grants, a paradigm that 
purportedly changes property relations, leading “just like in Europe” to radical inequality and 
the transmutation of the population into peasants, while at the same time “exporting” 
Brāhmaṇical ideology. 
The problem with such a model is that all of these evidentiary grounds are no longer 
viewed as tenable by the very specialists concerned with study of these discrete topics. 1) The 
study of Prakrit epigraphy has now revealed that the institution of the autonomous land grant 
55Manu Devadevan’s work is at once extraordinary in the richness of its archival engagement and a cautionary tale in regard to what happens when history of the Tantric Mantramārga as a knowledge system is written out of the history of Indian religions. Importing a historiographical move from Maoist critiques of Lamaist Tibet, Devadevan argues that before early modernity in the Deccan there is no such thing as “religion” among the common people, for what we call religion is only the concern of a small class of elite “religious professionals” and temple culture is in fact virtually non-existent until the tenth century. As a preface to offering an extraordinary account of early modern Kannada religious imaginaries, Devadevan asserts that the popular yogin-centric religion of the Deccan, which is not Hindu, needs to be read as an adaptation of Sufi models of social formation and community cultivation that is then copied/transposed onto figures like Matsyendranātha. What is missing from this narrative is a recognition that the very features being attributed to Islamic influence were already integral to Tantric institutional imaginaries. Nevertheless, there are many useful insights and some fabulous social historical accounts, particularly concerning the differentiation of the politics of caste from other localized power dynamics, to be found in his two book length studies from which a reader is bound to benefit. See Manu V. Devadevan, A Prehistory of Hinduism (Berlin: De Gruyter Open, 2016), as well as Manu V. Devadevan, The “Early Medieval” Origins of India (New Delhi: Cambridge University Press, 2020). 56A deeply influential figure both in terms of the Marxist school of historiography within the Indian academy as well in regard to the composition of many of the source books and textbooks used in Indian schools, R. S. Sharma’s understanding of early medieval India continued to be refined throughout his long career, in terms of the core evidentiary basis that was offered for what remained essentially the same socio-historical model. While the interested reader can trace its development from 1965 through the twenty-first century across a range of related works, the starting and ending point of his investigations will suffice for our purposes.

was already an integral part of politics under the Sātavāhanas as early as the second century of 
the Common Era and never really fell out of practice.57 In that context, the practice played a 
pivotal role in the institutionalization of Buddhism, not Brāhmaṇism. There is thus nothing 
particularly “early medieval” about land grants, nor do they seem to be the carriers of a specific 
religious ideology. Indeed the recent work of archeologists examining the same period, such 
as Aloka Parasher Shen of the University of Hyderabad, who has given us case studies of 
vibrant pre-Sātavāhana local state formations that endure under their rule and persist beyond 
their demise, should seriously call us to question whether we should even link deep social and 
economic change to large-scale dynastic state formations.58 2) Archeological studies, including 
57Here the reader is directed to the recent fascinating work of Meera Visvanathan, who is in the early stages of writing a history within the study of Indian epigraphy of the use of technical terms and the legal institutions to which they allude. As Visvanathan skillfully and tactfully argues in her essay “The First Land Grants: The Emergence of an Epigraphic Tradition in the Early Deccan”: “For decades now, the land-grant has been recognized as a key feature of the ‘early medieval’ times. Such grants of land—revenue-free and accompanied by a host of exemptions—are said to be made to the ruling elite. . . . From the fourth century onwards, the practice began to grow, so that by the fifth and sixth centuries CE, ruling dynasties across the subcontinent were engaged in making such grants. This phenomenon cut across religious boundaries, reflecting new modes of expression and a whole new political economy. In this essay, I seek to trace the story backwards, to locate the origins of the land grant in the early historic period. Where the land grant assumes centre stage in the debates on early medieval India, I argue that historians have not paid adequate attention to its emergence and early forms.” Meera Visvanathan, “The First Land Grants: The Emergence of an Epigraphic Tradition in the Early Deccan,” in Mekhola Gnomes, et. al., ed., Social Worlds of Premodern Transactions (Delhi: Primus Books, 2020), 1. While Visvanathan’s rhetoric assuages the objections of senior colleagues and mentors within the hierarchical status- conscious Indian academy, the arguments she keeps making effectively undercut any special association of the early medieval with a new model for the management of land vis-à-vis the state. 
A complementary case is made in her important (2018) piece “Uṣavadāta’s Akhyavanivi: The Eternal Endowment in the Early Historic Deccan,” which offers a close reading of the earliest sources in both the epigraphic and literary records that refer to the “undying” tax-free grant. In our later sources, this is a gift of land guaranteeing an effectively autonomous self-governing endowment existing outside of the operations of the state, theoretically operating in perpetuity. Visvanathan shows that in our earliest record, the Akhayanivi is not land but an enormous gift of money vested into artisanal guilds that is aimed at the perpetuation over the longue durée of preexisting institutions and their material needs. She then traces several generations later the transmutation of this “endowment,” originally somewhat akin to the endowing of a bunch of funded academic chairs and an institute to a university, to the bestowal of caves and villages, again in the service of ensuring the long term financial and institutional stability of a community operating outside the state. Meera Visvanathan, “Uṣavadāta’s Akhayanivi: The Eternal Endowment in the Early Historic Deccan,” Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 41 (2018): 509–535. 58Grounded in decades of archeological work complemented by fieldwork studying material culture, Sen effectively demonstrates that the emergence of imperial cultures centered on strong states such as the Sātavāhanas had a marginal impact on the social and economic development of the already preexisting regional polities in the eastern Deccan. For our purposes, the reader will benefit most from the first three chapters (pg. 39–140) under

those specific to the western Deccan, centered on the Gupta and post-Gupta world, have 
revealed with startling consistency that there is almost zero correlation between the 
establishing of land grants in our documentary records and forensic evidence for changes in 
population settlement patterns.59 Simply put, establishing a land grant does not mean that the 
the subheading “Establishing the Terrain.” Aloka Parasher Sen, Settlement and Local Histories of the Early Deccan (Abingdon: Taylor & Francis, 2021). 59In collaboration with Indian scholars working at a range of locations, the archaeologists Derek Kennet and Jason Hawkes are the process of demolishing many of our working assumptions about historical change, the use of land, and its relation to the state in premodern India. In carrying out their work, they are directly confronting and demolishing the historiographical shibboleths that define the study of India prior to the advent of Islam. Thus, as Kennet frames things in a recent work: “This paper discusses and reviews the archaeological evidence on which R. S. Sharma and others have based the theory of urban decay that they believe occurred across South Asia in the late Early Historic and Early Medieval periods (between the 3rd and the 7th centuries AD). The paper points out and discusses major problems with almost all aspects of the archaeological data, from excavation strategy and methodology to chronology, and indicates how these problems may bias the data and thereby undermine broader interpretations.” Derek Kennet, “Reconsidering the Decline of Urbanism in late Early Historic and Early Medieval South Asia,” in J. Schiettecatte and C. Robin, eds. Les Préludes de l’Islam: Ruptures et Continuités dans les Civilisations du Proche-Orient de l’Afrique Orientale, de l’Arabie et de l’Inde à la Veille de l’Islam (Paris: de Boccard, 2013), 331. 
Taking on R. S. Sharma’s model of urban decay and economic contraction as the defining social and economic conditions of the post-Gupta feudal world, Kennet’s core observation is that the contraction of pre-existing urban settlements and relative scarcity of new coinage is actually the defining feature of the Gupta-Vākāṭaka archive itself. He proposes, however, that these dynamics can be explained based on, on the one hand, the continued reuse of preexisting coinage as legal tender and the emergence of a consistent pattern of what he calls “the ‘double urban centre’ scenario,” wherein, around the third century CE places like Beshnagar decline at the very same moment that adjacent sites such as Vidiśa rise to a new prominence. After demonstrating that this is a repeating pattern throughout the Gupta-Vākāṭaka world, Kennet proposes that we see a new site-specific specialization of social function, perhaps associated with the rise of temples located at the new adjacent site, and shows us that while concentrating exclusively on the first site leads to a narrative of urban decay, when networked sites are treated in tandem, the phenomena disappears. Drawing on a decade worth of field excavation, Kennet’s work at Paithan and then throughout greater Vidarbha in central and northern Maharashtra demonstrates a number of counterintuitive dimensions concerning the archaeological evidence for patterns of habitation at undying land grants, pointing above all else to stories of deep continuity over the longue durée.

This dimension of his work, to which Jason Hawkes made an initial contribution, has continued to develop in a series of much more theoretically oriented publications by Hawkes dedicated to rethinking the evidence for how we study early medieval India and differentiate it from the classical period, nearly all of which should form essential reading for future generations of scholars of Indian religions and cultures. Jason Hawkes, “Finding the ‘Early Medieval’ in South Asian Archaeology,” Asian Perspectives 53, no. 1 (2014): 53–96; Jason Hawkes, “Chronological Sequences and the ‘Problem’ of Early Medieval Settlement in India,” Puratattva, Bulletin of the Indian Archaeological Society 44 (2014): 208–228; Jason Hawkes, Riza Abbas, and Sitaram Toraskar, “Multi- Period Regional Survey Data from Vidarbha, Maharashtra, India,” Journal of Open Archaeology Data 8, no. 2 (2020): 2–15; Jason Hawkes, “Ever the Handmaid?

On this rich evidentiary basis, in his most recent work, in a recent study contextualizing all the Gupta-Vākāṭaka charters in relation to their find sites, Hawkes has offered the following conclusions to which the historian or religion would do well to attend. This revolutionary passage, despite its length, is worth quoting in full: “Consideration of the landscape settings of land grants on a regional scale reveals a great deal of information about the areas where land was granted. These insights allow us to contextualise the practice of granting land, and to make inferences about the wider societal dynamics that existed and the transformations that took place over the long term. We see, for example, that each area was settled from a very early period—long before the Vakataka kings began to donate land to brahmins. Further, settlement expanded significantly and variably throughout the region during the later centuries BC. This was most pronounced in the eastern parts of the region, where it was connected with existing (pre-Vakataka) local centres at Adam and Pauni and was contemporaneous with the spread of Buddhism into the area—typical of trajectories of urban development in large parts of India at the time (Chakrabarti 1995). Yet, differences in urbanism also existed between these neighbouring areas. Settlements around Pauni conform to the ‘classic’ model of early historic urbanism, with a large, fortified city dominating the immediate area (Erdosy 1988; Allchin 1995); around Mandhal, however, a much smaller fortified centre at Adam was part of a more diffuse distribution of sites, indicating more localised networks of resourcing, production and exchange. By contrast, developments around Chammak continued to follow an earlier, Iron Age pattern of settlement. Such marked variations appear to reflect the existence of different social systems at the local level, each with its own modes of social and economic organisation and possibly even cultural traditions [italics added]. 
“Examination of the archaeological landscape also reveals considerable religious dynamism in the region. Textual studies and histories of art have long since charted the existence of local cults and their incorporation into the emerging Hindu sects of Shiva and Vishnu under Vakataka patronage (Shastri 1997; Bakker 2004). Yet, our surveys reveal that these cults and their incorporation into an emerging Hinduism were only one part of a wider and vibrant religious history; this involved not only other pre-existing local beliefs and practices manifest in megalithic monuments and burials, but also a deep-rooted Buddhist monastic presence, both of which appear to have been part of local political economies and continued well into the early centuries AD. 
“These findings allow us to reflect on the forms of social organisation and transformation that have been associated with these land grants. It is clear that the granting of land did not lead to the settlement of new areas or of tribal populations. Nor were land grants accompanied by an expansion of settlement, which, in turn, makes it unlikely that there was an increase in agricultural production or development of an agrarian economy. Beyond these obvious discrepancies with certain historical theories, grounding the charters in their landscape context improves our understanding of for whom and with what purpose they were intended. As noted above, they record grants of land by Vakataka kings, based in the east of the region, to people referred to as brahmins, or priests. These brahmins are variously portrayed in the historical literature as: an already established part of a uniform ‘Brahmanical society’ that existed across South Asia; as mobile groups who were thrust into new regions alongside grants of land; or as people who became brahmins or began to subscribe to that particular social order—a process formalised through their attribution as such by a dominant sociocultural group (i.e. the Hindu Vakataka kingdom). The fact that there were clearly different social systems across the region suggests that the latter was indeed the case. The land grants may therefore have been contractual agreements, wherein groups occupying similar social roles as brahmins would become part of this new, royal-sanctioned Brahmanical social order in return for land ownership and land rights. As such, these copperplate charters might best be thought of as the embodiment of royal investments in different areas in an attempt to create a new social formation [italics added]. 
“The distribution of sites across the region also allows us to reconsider the nature of the state or polity that adopted the practice of issuing land grants. The absence of a uniform settlement pattern in the area around Mandhal, the first capital of the Vakatakas, is significant. It suggests that the Vakataka ‘kingdom’ was, at least initially, more of a material project that was invested in implementing a new social order rather than a regional territory directly ruled by the Vakataka royal family. The archaeological contexts of the land grants also complicate our understanding of the relationship(s) between the Vakataka kingdom and the surrounding polities that received these grants. Whether it is framed in terms of the feudal state or as integrative processes, this relationship is viewed as a power dynamic with the emerging ‘state’, which placed royal-sanctioned Hindu temples at its core, being the dominant party. While this may have been the case, however, appreciating the fact that society as a 
106 
site suddenly has more people nor even that the patterns of consumption and ideological 
production, as reflected in disposal material culture, change in any meaningful way. Nor does 
there seem to be any archeological basis for that famous canard of Indology, the expanding 
Brāhmaṇical frontier. Instead of being located on the periphery, the vast majority of land grants 
being established, renewed, and re-established are already populated and were already 
engaging in the same kind of trade exchange with the domains of the donor. The emerging 
archeological perspective, made possible by the implementation of better methods than the old 
approach of digging one trench at a site away from extant structures (which are usually on top 
of the old city) and then striating its contents, is that, rather than making new realities, just as 
often it seems that the state or a donor merely uses land grants to recognize and codify into law 
what excavations reveal were already operant on-the-ground dynamics. A similar story seems 
to hold true for most “early medieval towns.” Most of these are located in roughly the same 
places as their classical predecessors. Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing to indicate a 
general decrease in their population or prosperity, with the caveat that the early medieval 
period does often see the old center of a settlement become more peripheral, thus yielding 
fewer material artifacts, perhaps on account of new approaches to urban design. 3) 
whole was more ‘pointillistic’ than previously thought forces us to realise one very important point: an exclusive focus on the Vakatakas can never elucidate the ways in which they related to the other political economies around them, nor fully expose the effects of granting land to particular groups within their kingdom.” Jason Hawkes, et. al., “Grounding Texts and Theories of Societal Change,” Antiquity 96 (2022): 622–23. 
Succinctly, the recent literature in the field of archeology has called into question nearly every aspect of traditional accounts of the sociological significance of land grants, which do not appear in the vast majority of cases to be involved in expanding Brāhmaṇical culture in a periphery, do not newly incorporate non-urban Ādivāsi communities, do not correspond to changes in agricultural production or lead to the onset of totally new kinds of economic activity, and do not necessarily entail the transplanting of new communities of Brāhmaṇas as part of a civilizing mission. Similarly, the evidence for a dominant territorializing state as the central catalyst for social change that imposes uniform economic and social forms on the territories in which it is active, as opposed to royal centers as one among many powerful differentiated social actors, is quite weak. In the absence of the old cliches, it seems pertinent to simply wait for the archaeology of classical and early medieval India to provide us with better evidence before we resume the process of robustly retheorizing the political and social economies of power in premodernity. 
107Numismaticians, such as Robert Bracey of the British Museum, have shown that there is little 
evidence for a post-Gupta era decrease in the production of coinage and none for a decreased 
dissemination of coinage such as would be indicative of sudden, severe, and enduring 
economic decline.60 In fact, in actuality the historical trend is that the money supply in South 
Asia just keeps expanding over the course of centuries. Impressions to the contrary stem from 
taking the curatorial practices of collectors, which naturally privilege famous dynasties and 
beautiful mintings over run-of the mill currency, as reflecting patterns of in situ coin 
circulation. If you look at coin hoards, in contrast, the distribution is totally different. 
Especially when you take into account the fact that the multigenerational use of the same kinds 
of coins as legal tender was standard practice, the idea that the economy “contracts” and that 
culture and governance as a result has to become localized is simply no longer supported by 
our sources. Finally, 4) perhaps most familiarly to Western scholarship, the evidence for a 
lasting overall decrease in long distance trade, presumed to coincide with the collapse of the 
Buddhist silk road, simply does not really exist.61 Instead, with the onset of a supposed early 
medieval, there is a proliferation of transregional trade guilds suddenly reflected in the 
inscriptional record. Again, to the west, we see dynasties such as the Rāṣṭrakūṭas forming new 
strong connections with the Arab world via oversea trade routes, on the one hand,62!while 
61As we await the publication of this research in a monograph form as part of the output of the research project of which it is a part, the reader is directed to R. Bracey, “Money Supply, Quantity Theory, & Feudalism in Sixth Century India,” Part 1, Beyond Boundaries: Religion, Region, Language and the State in Asia SOAS, London, December 12, 2017. The two parts of the talk are available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK119NhSgkI; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scVoW4d7W5Y. Bracey’s talk is framed explicitly as a refutation of Sharma’s arguments about coinage and the early medieval but also serves as a master class introduction to the methodology of cutting edge numismaticians and what they have to offer to the study of Indian history and sociality. On the fifth-century redistribution of foreign trade, correlated with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and two waves of Hunic invasions, see the analysis I present in the second division of chapter 3 of this study. 62For some concrete case studies, see Ranabir Chakravarti, “Coastal Trade and Voyages in Konkan: The Early Medieval Scenario,” The Indian Economic & Social History Review 35, no. 2 (1998): 97–123; Ranabir Chakravarti, “Merchants of Konkan,” The Indian Economic & Social History Review 23, no. 2 (1986): 207–215;

starting with the Pallavas (probably even earlier) there is extensive exchange going on between 
Kaliṅga and the Tamil country with Southeast Asia and modern-day Indonesia. 
Succinctly, the purely empirical foundation that underlies this whole mode of 
materially reductionist scholarship has been effectively falsified on its own terms. What is left, 
ironically, when concrete evidence is no longer in evidence, are a essentially a number of a 
priori ideological claims, many of them imported from Soviet era historiography, that define 
the Indian early medieval as a mode of false consciousness.63 Typically, as in the writings of 
R. Champakalakshmi64 and Kesavan Veluthat, feudal consciousness is then equated with a 
bhakti ideology.65 This complex is then seen as serving the structural function of legitimizing 
Ranabir Chakravarti, “Monarchs, Merchants and a Matha in Northern Konkan (c. 900–1053 AD),” The Indian Economic & Social History Review 27, no. 2 (1990): 189–208; Ranabir Chakravarti, Dipak Chandra Bhattacharyya, Devendra Handa, and Bratindra Nath Mukherjee, “Overseas Trade in Horses in Early Medieval India: Shipping and Piracy,” in Ranabir Chakarvarti, et. al., ed., Prācī-Prabhā: Perspectives in Indology (Essays in Honour of B. N. Mukherjee) (New Delhi: Harman Publishing House, 1989). 63A particularly candid representation of this perspective, where the “medieval” and the “feudal” are no longer identified on the basis of concrete patterns of socio-economic relations but as a “mentality” of hierarchical relations, a position whose influence on the India academy we have severely underestimated, is offered by Eugenia Vanina of The Centre for Indian Studies, Institute of Oriental Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences. See her monograph: Eugenia Vanina, Medieval Indian Mindscapes: Space, Time, Society, Man (New Delhi: Primus Books, 2012). 64 The later portion of Champakalakshmi’s career has been largely dedicated to reading the history of Indian thought and culture through the lens of an ideological consolidation made possible by bhakti: “Developing into an ethical and moral principle, capable of evolving new value systems, the bhakti concept succeeded in providing the basis for a dominant ideology, consciously promoted by the ruling families. . . . The political role of bhakti in Tamilakam would appear to have overshadowed its socio-religious purposes” (Champakalaksmi 2011, pg. 19). Bhakti, then, in this reading, normalized a new kind of state (exemplified by the Cōḻas) and a “new agrarian system based on land grants to brāhmaṇas or Caturvedis along with special privileges” (Champakalaksmi 2011, pg. 19). Champakalaksmi’s model treats bhakti, deliberately encouraged by state power, as an agent of cultural and institutional consolidation. In the realm of pure ideology, bhakti is aligned with the Purāṇicization of the Tamil country (through the adoption of the alien gods of Śiva and Viṣṇu) and in the material realm it is the impetus for centralized urbanization centered around bhakti temple complexes controlled by Brāhmaṇas and Brāhmaṇizers, drawing in populations from the countryside and reformatting them to accept the ideology of caste and recognize the dominance of kings on the basis of the bhakti model of subordination to a higher power. As we will see throughout the present work, very little of this model, which runs on gross generalizations, is founded on a close reading of either the empirical record or the theological programs articulated in the relevant textual corpuses. Succinctly, Champakalaksmi’s approach here is founded on method that is as facile and ungrounded from close readings of primary sources and documentary records as her earlier work was exemplarily grounded in them. See: R. Champakalakshmi, Religion, Tradition, and Ideology: Pre-colonial South India (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2011), especially the essays “From Devotion and Dissent to Dominance: The Bhakti of the Tamil Alvars and Nayanars” (pg. 53–86) and “Ideology and the State in South India” (pg. 606–636). 65 Veluthat’s account of bhakti ideology, treated again as the defining value system of the medieval, is much more explicitly reductionistically Marxist: “It has been shown that the bhakti of the Tamil saints was devotion to Śaiva 
109 
the inequitable property holding patterns of “Brāhmaṇized” upper classes and the power of the 
king. Modes of cultural production, such as temples, for example, are thus to be read as 
reflections of fixed patterns of class relations, such that “understanding” them is essentially an 
exercise in reconstructing these very same class relations. 
A certain dogmatism is a key shortcoming of the whole discourse. Where their very 
own chosen documentary records do not reflect the pregiven conclusions of the interpreter 
concerning said patterns of social relation, for example when the records in Tamil repeatedly 
or Vaiṣṇava deities consecrated in temples, and not just to ‘god’ or even Śiva or Viṣṇu in the abstract. It is also seen that earlier saints. . . had their sphere of activity in the Pallava territory which got extended to the Kāvēri valley. . . . An analysis of the distribution of temples sung about by the later Āḻvār and Nāyaṇār saints shows a concentration of temples. . . in the Cōḻa country on either side of the Kāvēri. The temple in the south as this time was emerging as a huge landed magnate and also the centre around which the brahmanical settlements revolved. When such centres became the rallying points of a social movement such as the bhakti movement, it was naturally the ideology of the brahmanical landed magnates that it carried with it as the leitmotif. It has been brought out that the bhakti movement legitimized the entire gamut of relationships in the social, economic, and political spheres. The graded hierarchy of economic relations with various shades to rights of land, the equally graded hierarchy of social relations with different shades of ritual status and the corresponding graded hierarchy of political relations with different shades of power and authority—this was reflected and legitimised in the religious world. While the bhakti movement has been shown by earlier historians as representing a veritable social reform movement spearheaded against caste and other forms of inequality, our analysis shows that it helped in consolidating the new social and political order in south India in the early medieval period. It strengthened and gave support to the new monarchy; and by favouring the ideology of the brahmanised sections in society, it helped the entire upper class to send its roots deeper in society.” Kesavan Veluthat, The Political Structure of Early Medieval South India (New Delhi: Orient Blackswan, 2012 [1993]), 35–36. 
As I aim to demonstrate over and over again by the end of the present work, even on the level of class analysis, most the claims that make up this model are demonstrably not correct. Far from being the impetus behind temple institutionalization, the discourse of learned twice-borns not acclimated in the Tantric knowledge systems are by and large ambivalent if not hostile to temple construction and the life-worlds it engenders. They are not the primary holders of land near temples, the main donors, nor the main beneficiaries. Indeed, the same holds true by and large for the very types of top-of-the-food-chain monarchical power with which Veluthat wants to associate the emergence of temple culture, for the royal temple, though atypically spectacular, as an institution is a minority actor throughout most of this history, with the vast majority of temple construction being at the impetus of localized political authorities or at the behest of guilds or community collectives from a range of non-elite backgrounds. Moreover, through the eleventh century, learned “non-Tantric inflected” Brāhmaṇical intellectual life is largely resolutely hostile to bhakti theology. Furthermore, in our earliest sources, bhakti prescriptive texts do not envision a “graded hierarchy of social relations,” but rather present the bhakta, vis-à-vis the non-bhakta, as a baseline social agent with religious and juridical privileges equal to his fellows. And far from acclimating the individual outsider to the norms of varṇāśramadharma, the earliest bhakti prescriptive literature envisions “bhakti ideology” as a wholesale substitute social contract, a position that persists in the imaginaries of elite agents well into the thirteenth century and beyond. If we are to seek a social basis for bhakti traditions, it is not within Brāhmaṇized society we must look, but in institutionalized social modalities of a very different sort, such as the imaginary of the maṭha (which, ironically, Veluthat sees as impetus for the suppression of bhakti ideology by Brāhmaṇas). 
110 
indicate that the standard terms for property possession kiḷān and kiḷavan are rarely associated 
with Brāhmaṇas despite the supposed omnipresence of Brāhmaṇa landholders, authors like 
Veluthat offer ad hoc justifications for why the normative claim, apparently lacking an 
evidentiary basis in their own archives, should not be dispensed with.66 
Though by no means so egregious, parallel conceptual shortcomings, particularly an 
inability to think about the religious dimension of the archives as a part of historical 
investigations in a nuanced manner, are sadly also in evidence within much of the otherwise 
excellent “purely historical” work emerging out of the American academy that directly 
addresses the social history of early medieval imaginaries. Even in the case of Cynthia Talbot’s 
Precolonial India in Practice: Society, Region, and Identity in Medieval Andhra, perhaps the 
finest empirically grounded work of its kind to date, “the religious” dimensions of the discourse 
under study are approached through repeated rhetorical exercises in “conceptual bracketing.”67 
Thus, for example, the Indian temple is described “quite apart from its religious significance” 
in terms of its integrative social function, as a site of prestige building, or in purely economic 
terms. While such descriptions are always insightful and often elegant, at the heart of the 
formulation is the presumption that social functions, the construction of reputations, as well as 
pre-market economics are conceptually and functionally discrete from some reified domain 
being designated as “the religious,” which apparently has to be approached “on its own terms,” 
in a manner that denies its causal impact on the real world and its institutions. What such a 
66See, for example, Veluthat (2012), The Political Structure of Early Medieval South India, 81–82. The issue at hand, namely, how much do Brāhmaṇas own and control the land and with it the temple estates that Veluthat sees as the central vectors for the dissemination of bhakti ideology, is pivotal. If Brāhmaṇas, who purportedly embody “mainstream Smārta values,” do not in fact own and control these early medieval institutional spaces, on Veluthat’s own terms, a material reductionist account of the early medieval as defined by a Brāhmaṇical bhakti ideology that serves to naturalize Brāhmaṇical privilege and material interests collapses. 67Cynthia Talbot, Precolonial India in Practice: Society, Region, and Identity in Medieval Andhra (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001). 
111 
model side-steps is another possibility, namely, that to tell premodern stories about “integrative 
social function,” about “prestige building,” or about “economics,” is a wasted effort in the 
absence of talking about and taking seriously those types of phenomena that we now label 
“religion.” Indeed, the second we extract out of from our archive an essentialized “social” or 
“economic,” notwithstanding that the phenomena we are labelling as such are often playing 
out on the grounds of temples and enacted by people who identify within the records as bhaktas 
or ācāryas, we are imposing modern Western ideas of a purely secular realm of instrumentalist 
tactical rationality. Essentially, we presume that, in their heart of hearts, most people on the 
ground in medieval India strove to be like the ideal rational choice motivated employee as 
imagined by the RAND Corporation and not like Rāma. From my perspective, so long as we 
do not fall prey to equally anachronistic romanticizing or polemical fantasies expressive of our 
relation to our own present, our time is simply better spent immersing ourselves in 
multidimensional primary sources archives and seeing what we can excavate out of them when 
we attend to their individuated methods of assemblage on their own terms. Taking such an 
approach as a point of departure, we will then be in a much more enviable position for 
responsibly querying the archive concerning our own present-inflected itineraries on the basis 
of which we can present to our readers engaging representations that speak to wider shared 
interests. Indeed, if we have to frame our investigation as a dialogical response to preceding 
scholarly discourses, a more promising approach is to intervene in contemporary 
conversations, propelled by a community of scholars in close dialogue, which are still 
generating substantive and groundbreaking intellectual production. As we will soon discover, 
outside the realm of Indian philosophy, there are essentially two robust and primarily evidence 
112 
driven research programs within the study of premodern Hindu traditions in the contemporary 
academy that are primarily focused on dialogical engagement with Sanskrit sources.68 The first 
takes as its concern the history of Dharmaśāstra, while the second is primarily dedicated to the 
recovery of the textual corpus of the Tantric traditions and their antecedents. Ironically, despite 
the existence of numerous points of obvious overlap these two conversations have been 
happening in almost complete isolation from each other. As its title promises, one of the major 
interventions of Ending the Śaiva Age: The Rise of the Brāhmaṇa Legalist and the 
Universalization of Hindu Dharma is that it seeks to place these two discourses into serious 
and sustained dialogue for the first time. 
Until the early 1990’s, in the twentieth century, both within India and in the Western 
academy, with rare exceptions, the study of Hindu law had largely proceeded in alignment 
with two research trajectories, both of them heavily inflected by colonial knowledge. In the 
first Eurocentric approach, the study of topics and texts within Dharmaśāstra were habitually 
to be treated dialogically, either in relation to the Anglo-Indian traditions of jurisprudence 
imposed under the British Raj or the history of European legal thinking as rooted in Roman 
common law. Within such a paradigm, the core analytical activity became the careful recovery 
of the specific meaning of terms or titles of law in classical Dharmaśāstra works. This was 
largely to be accomplished through two approaches. The first involved demonstrating the 
68The other robust dialogical research program is, of course, Bhakti Studies. However, by and large, excluding some engagement with earlier Tamil sources (on which one may fruitfully consult the work of Karen Pechilis, Archana Venkatesan, Francis Clooney, and Vasudha Narayan, for instance), this domain of research takes as its primary focus Indian religions in early modernity. It is only relatively recently, in the writings of Hamsa Stainton (in relation to kāvya), Christian Novetzke (in relation to the early medieval western Deccan), Monika Horstmann, and Tyler Williams (thinking about yoga and nirguṇa movements in relation to scholastic communities in Rajasthan), Anand Venkatkrishnan (thinking about the Bhāgavata Purāṇa in dialogue with both elite Sanskrit pandit culture and subaltern Keralan traditions), and Elaine Fisher (reimagining vernacular Śaivism in light of its Sanskrit sources) that examining continuities between vernacular bhakti imaginaries and their formative antecedents within earlier Sanskrit discourse and thinking about bhakti with and in relation to Brāhmaṇical imaginaries has begun to emerge as a consistent part of this conversation. 
113 
divergence of the classical term from its application in Anglo-Indian law.69 The second sought 
to scrutinize points of commonality and differentiation vis-à-vis a shared European legal 
heritage that had informed the rendering of a Sanskrit term into European languages through 
the equation of specific Sanskrit and European lexemes.70 While much of this microanalysis, 
informed by great erudition, stands the test of time, what is conspicuously absent from these 
conversations was the consideration of specific works of Dharmaśāstra taken as coherent and 
differentiated wholes. 
A competing paradigm for thinking about Hindu law, often fiercely anti-colonial in its 
expression, began to be articulated in the early twentieth century in a variety of places on the 
subcontinent but especially in association with a community of scholars working in what was 
then the Bombay Presidency. Though they differed in their particulars as well as their chosen 
language of expression, what such scholars held in common was a deep devotion to archival 
work as well as a shared perception, inflected by nationalist and politically conversative 
sentiments, that Dharmaśāstra demands to be viewed as an internally coherent and 
comprehensive system of knowledge deeply rooted in the lived realities of Indian people that 
should be studied on its own terms. Such a perspective found its most spectacular expression 
in two magisterial and still indispensable works of scholarship: Pandurang Vaman Kane’s

Civil Law in India, and the equally voluminous five-volume Sanskrit Dharmakośa, largely 
completed under the direction of Lakshmanasastri Josi at the Prajnna-Pathasala-Mandal at 
Wai.71 In a certain sense, both of these works are “historical,” which is to say they periodize a 
body of knowledge in chronological sequence and recognize and document divergent positions 
in matters of doctrine. And yet, at the same time, both works presume a fundamental unity to 
the discourse of Dharmaśāstra, such that, while individual topics might be approached from a 
range of perspectives by different jurists, participation in the knowledge system was always 
dependent on a shared and singular view about what Dharmaśāstra was and what it was for. 
The revolution in the academic study of Dharmaśāstra, which plausibly can be seen as 
commencing in 1989 with the publication of Richard W. Lariviere’s critical edition and 
translation of the Nāradasmṛti72 but really takes off with the 1993 publication by Patrick 
Olivelle of The Āśrama System,73 combines the careful micro-textual philological work of the 
European paradigm with a reorientation to reading specific works of Dharmaśāstra dialogically 
in relation to other conversation partners within the same discipline without presupposing a 
necessary intervention by Anglo-Indian and European counterpoints. At the same time, this 
new approach begins to break from both of its predecessors in its growing recognition of the 
existence of fundamental and irresolvable differences contained within the discourse of Hindu 
Law, not merely about this or that discrete topic, but about the very nature and purpose of 
Dharmaśāstra, the types of agents to which it is addressed, and thus the defining features of

what constitutes the center and periphery of Brāhmaṇical values. In a manner much akin to a 
similar intervention made by scholars like Jacob Neusner in the study of Rabbinical law, much 
of this work takes as its foundation, largely due to the efforts of Olivelle, the critical editing 
and translation of the foundational works of the discourse from the late Vedic period onward 
in chronological order followed by the production of second order comparative reflections 
about their contents with the aim of detecting instances of historical change.74 Such efforts thus 
provide a shared framework and mode of acculturation allowing for ongoing informed 
conversations among an even wider range of scholars, carried out both on and off the page, 
that systematically seek to refine our understanding of particular topics and their points of 
intersection with other aspects of Hindu thought and culture in a most productive fashion. 
We will be engaging in detail with some of the key findings of this research program 
in just a few pages within our first chapter, such that an extended discussion of these matters 
can probably be delayed. For the moment, it suffices to say that what this research program 
has revealed, at first almost inadvertently, is that not only do the individual constituent 
elements that make up most popular perceptions of “a unitary Brāhmaṇical ideology” not 
74Olivelle’s programmatic text-critical engagement with classical Dharmaśāstra and its major intertexts proceeds as follows: Patrick Olivelle, The Law Codes of Āpastamba, Gautama, Baudhāyana, and Vasiṣṭha (New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 2002); Patrick Olivelle, Dharmasūtra Parallels: Containing the Dharmasūtras of Āpastamba, Gautama, Baudhāyana, and Vasiṣṭha (New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 2005); Patrick and Suman Olivelle, Manu's Code of Law: A Critical Edition and Translation of the Manava-Dharmasastra (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004).

On the basis of this methodological reconstruction of the textual foundations of early religio-juridical discourse, what has emerged is a larger interpretive conversation, contributed to especially by Donald Davis, Timothy Lubin, Jarred Whittaker, Mark McClish, and David Brick, that takes these established resources as its point of departure in the service of meticulous close readings and cross-corpus historicization of the emergence of concepts. For two important collections of essays historicizing core dharma concepts across the boundaries of genre and religious tradition made possible by this textual groundwork, see especially Patrick, Olivelle, ed., Dharma: Studies in Its Semantic, Cultural, and Religious History (New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, 2009); Patrick Olivelle, ed., Gṛhastha: The Householder in Ancient Indian Religious Culture (New York: Oxford University Press, 2019).

emerge all at once in a fully articulated form, but they do not even emerge out of the same 
sources. Instead, we find these individual elements, appearing in isolation at distinct moments 
in the historical records, with no implicit logical connection being forged in situ to one another. 
In fact, the key ideas we think of as making up a shared Brāhmaṇical worldview are scattered 
across written expressions that at their own historical moments of articulation seem to have 
represented heated agonistic exchanges produced by competing communities with very 
divergent visions of what it means to be a Brāhmaṇa” and what sort of world “Brāhmaṇas” 
should aspire to bring into being. In fact, what the evidence suggests is that the story of the 
production of individual doctrines and ideals and the story of their programmatic consolidation 
into a shared worldview are effectively two different stories. A working out the wider 
ramifications of such discoveries, largely tangential to this older research program, is an 
integral dimension of the current project. 
In contrast to the relative lack of critical self-reflection about the history of secondary 
literature in the field of Dharma Studies and their continued impact on the discipline, to its 
considerable credit, Tantric Studies has repeatedly thought and rethought its origins, often in 
lengthy full-size monographs.75 As such, a deep dive into these materials, telling yet again the 
basic story of the polemical marginalization throughout the twentieth century of those who for 
whatever reason chose to take up this “red-headed stepchild” of a field of study need not detain 
us. Suffice it to say that for much of the nineteenth and most of the twentieth century, at the 
very same time that popular reception of Tantric-inflected ideas thrived within occultist and

Urban, Tantra: Sex, Secrecy, Politics, and Power in the Study of Religion (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003); Hugh B. Urban, The Power of Tantra: Religion, Sexuality and the Politics of South Asian Studies (New York: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2009); as well as the opening essay to David Gordon White, ed., Tantra in Practice (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2000). 
117New Age movements76 as well as among global guru movements, the academic study of Indian 
religions, to say nothing of Indology, clung to the notion that Tantra formed a tertiary part of 
the history of Indian thought and religion and that people who thought the topic was worth 
understanding tended to be weird and intellectually unserious. The grand irony here is that the 
cultivation of this “common sense” perspective is emerging out of colonial institutional spaces, 
especially in and around Calcutta but also to a substantive degree in Bombay, Masulipatam, 
and Mysore, where many of the very same elite local social agents (both Brāhmaṇa and non- 
Brāhmaṇa) collaborating with British authorities were themselves participants in Tantric 
imaginaries.77 
While individual researchers, especially Mircea Eliade, R. Gnoli, and André Padoux 
had already made invaluable contributions to beginning to have us think about Tantra as a 
knowledge system, the emergence of organized research programs producing communities of 
Western scholars engaged in dialogical research invested in understanding Tantra is a product 
of the mid-1980s and is marked by two almost simultaneous events. The first, in the western 
hemisphere, is the founding of the Society for Tantric Studies in 1986.78 The second is the 
publication, in 1985, by Alexis Sanderson of “Purity and Power among the Brahmans of 
Kashmir,” followed shortly thereafter, in 1993, by his establishing of a graduate program at 
Oxford University centered on the philologically grounded study of classical Tantric textual

See also Julian Strube, Global Tantra (New York: Oxford University Press, 2022). 77An important under-recognized intervention here is the study of “Arthur Avalon” as a composite author function combining the skills and abilities of the English jurist Sir John Woodroffe with that of his Śākta guru Śivacandra Vidyārṇava.

traditions.79 In the absence of these two developments, the type of scholarship to which the 
present study aspires, which liberally draws on both traditions, would be inconceivable. 
As its originary manifesto, penned in collaboration by the Sinologists Jim Sanford and 
Charles Orzech make plain, the Society for Tantric Studies aimed to “bridge the gap between. 
. . [the study of Tantra in] China-Japan on the one hand and India-S. E. Asia on the other,”80 
while drawing upon talent situated across a range of academic disciplines and engaged in the 
study of a multitude of religions. In other words, from its inception, the American research 
program was already global and interdisciplinary and willing to incorporate, or at least 
examine, both “emic” and “etic” perspectives in a manner that was basically unique within the 
American academy of its day. Above all else, the STS has fostered the notion that any 
understanding of Tantric knowledge demands we reexamine our own inherited methodological 
presumptions and adapt and develop new tools and perspectives that are better aligned, yet not 
merely coterminous with, the self-understandings presented by our sources, such that we can 
both capture them in their particularity and explain them with some nuance, not just identifying 
Asian versions of some already well-known Western reality. In its efforts to create a “stable 
interchange among interested parties,”81 but also to craft a path for the professionalization of a 
multigenerational cohort of scholars with shared interests (incorporating a veritable Who’s 
Who among scholars in our discipline, including one of its key intended readers), the society

has moved from success to success, culminating in the acceptance of the discipline as a regular 
component of the American Academy of Religion. Many of the methodologies pioneered by 
its members have been incorporated (albeit sometimes without due acknowledgement) into a 
wider academic study of religion and few would now dismiss the idea that there is place within 
Religious Studies for thinking about Tantric traditions across a wide range of regions and time 
periods. Perhaps most importantly, Tantric Studies developed from being merely a shared point 
of interest into a shared discourse, with its own language, culture, techniques, and conceptual 
preoccupations into which new voices, myself included, could be acculturated. As any 
participant in such conversations will immediately recognize, though many of the core 
problematics we will engage with herein may differ, this study is deeply influenced by my 
enthusiastic participation, since 2005, within this thought collective and is thus indebted in 
ways both conscious and otherwise to nearly two decades of thought-provoking and life- 
changing conversations with mentors, colleagues, and friends invested in the study of Tantra. 
If the Society for Tantric Studies demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt that 
Tantric knowledge and its surrounding cultures is “good for thinking with” and that we can 
learn not just about but “from” these traditions, if not always the lessons they seek to teach us, 
the contributions of what we might call the Oxford collective in Tantric Studies, comprised of 
the incomparable Alexis Sanderson and his many students, amounts to recovering and 
historicizing the canon of an entire civilization as well as a robust theoretical demonstration 
that textual critical methods can be utilized in the service of doing intellectual and cultural 
history of religions. As Sanderson has now related to us several times with great clarity in 
120 
thinking about his own intellectual trajectory,82 three foundational years of study under Swami 
Lakshmanjoo, the last great learned polymath of the “Kashmir Śaiva” tradition that inherited 
the mantle of the Anuttara Trika of Abhinavagupta, initially inspired efforts to engage in what 
was essentially source-criticism of Abhinavagupta’s and his disciples’ use of inherited 
materials.83 Focused pursuit of such efforts, above and beyond the realm of printed literature, 
then lead to the discovery of the survival in manuscript, in multiple locations but especially 
within the archives of Nepal, of a vast array of textual resources previously thought to be lost 
or entirely unknown to scholarship. The painstaking reconstruction and periodization of these 
discrete traditions, offering what is now the standard mapping of Tantra as a knowledge 
system,84 in and of itself represents the sort of contribution on which the leading figures in any 
82The most recent autobiographical review of his research program forms pg. 2–6 of Alexis Sanderson, “How Public was Śaivism?” Tantric Communities in Context, ed. Nina Mirnig, Marion Rastelli, and Vincent Eltschinger (Vienna: Austrian Academy of Sciences Press, 2019), 1–46. 83A good example of this kind of this type of work is an early essay that seeks to establish that the position of the Mālinīvijayottara, the root text to which the Tantrāloka responds, is not non-dualist: Alexis Sanderson, The Doctrine of the Mālinīvijayottaratantra,” in T. Goudriaan, ed., Ritual and Speculation in Early Tantrism: Studies in Honour of Andre Padoux (Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 1992), 281–312. 84Sanderson’s schematic mapping of the Tantric traditions, which at once offers an account of their historical evolution and their doctrinal diversity, has gone through a number of iterations. In its current form, it proposes that what we call Tantric traditions emerge out a confluence of two prior religious imaginaries. The first of these, the Atimārga (the “path beyond”), which had its own ascetic traditions, is now understood to contain three divisions: 1) the Pāñcārthika Pāśupatas, whose core surviving scripture is the Pāśupatasūtra, who bathe themselves three times in the ashes of the cremation ground 2) the Lākulas, whose ascetics carry a skull and embrace a theology that rejects questions of purity, but whose core cosmology and theology is deeply influential on later Tantric Śaivism 3) pre-Tantric Kāpālika traditions, venerating Bhairava and emaciated goddesses, who in an equivalent manner are the predecessors of later Śākta traditions of the Kulamārga. The second input, in contrast, is what Sanderson understands as pre-Tantric “lay Śaiva” traditions as exemplified by the Śivadharmaśāstra, which we will explore in more detail in the present study. 
What we call Tantric traditions, however, is the second of these religious imaginaries, known as the Mantramārga (the “path of mantras”). Within this domain, it is important to note as there is much confusion regarding such matters, stemming from discarded prior models, that the word “Śaiva” is a general referent, equally inclusive of a number of Tantric traditions of Bhairava and Goddess worship as it is of the Śiva-centric traditions that will come to be conflated with the dualistic theology of the later scholastic Śaiva Siddhānta. It is this larger “big-tent” Śaivism, then, that is the intended referent when Sanderson speaks of the “Śaiva Age.” In actuality, as the present work will continue to demonstrate, it is becoming apparent that these Śaiva traditions at the level of the actual scriptures do not propound the programmatic dualism that is ascribed to them by Śaiva Siddhānta exegetes beginning with Sadyojyotis in the seventh century, but instead express a range of perspectives both concerning the relationship of the individual soul to the god-head and vis-à-vis other Mantramārga traditions. In this regard, freed from their exegetical reception, they are frequently much more akin doctrinally to the ambiguous quasi- bhedābheda positions presented by the rest of classical Tantra. 
121 
given field tend to rest their reputation. Careful textual work dedicated to the study of a corpus 
of materials, as opposed to the usual philological critical editing by an individual scholar of 
single discrete works, however, then revealed two rather unexpected realities. 
The first was that the atypically high degree of intertextuality, the wholesale borrowing 
and adaptation across traditions that almost defines the texture of tantric textuality was 
invaluable not only when it came the reconstruction of individual sources, but in the service of 
historicizing the interrelationships between whole canons of knowledge and even across the 
boundaries of different religions.85 The method that emerged from such an approach, now 
widely implemented by Sanderson’s students,86 and which very much informs my approach to 
textual study, calls on the scholar to systematically read a chosen subject, often line by line, in 
tandem with the available array of textual parallels. Such an approach at once attunes the reader 
to the range of influences (both textual and extra-textual) with which a given composition 
presupposed its intended readers would already be familiar while at the same time honing the 
precision of the translation of terms of art in light of a range of emic explanations. In short, 
Finally, following Abhinavagupta, in his most recent publications, Sanderson now recognizes the legitimacy of a Tantric domain, superseding the Mantramārga, which he labels Kulamārga, the defining feature of which is communal orgiastic modes of worship along with, in some strains, a radical rejection of purity that offers an epistemological critique of the nature of reality. The Kulamārga emerges organically out the pre-Tantric Kāpālika traditions in much the same manner that much of the Mantramārga is an evolute out of the Lākulas. 
In practice, the vast majority of the scriptural sources available to us, including even the sole surviving complete classical Bhairava Tantra, the Svacchanda, contain sections that have incorporated or been colonized by Kulamārga imaginaries. In fact, in practice, the vast majority of scriptural works in the traditions of the Trika and in regard to the pre-philosophical scriptural Kālī Krama represent a synthesis of archaic Śākta but pre-Kulamārga traditions with the innovations of the Kulamārga. At the level of practice, these boundaries were even less defined. Indeed, much of this speciation of traditions, apart from its vague memory of historical evolution, seems to be a scholastic exercise with polemical dimensions. 85In this regard for the debut of the method, see first Alexis Sanderson, “Vajrayāna: Origin and Function,” in Buddhism into the Year 2000. International Conference Proceedings (Los Angeles: Dhammakāya Foundation, 1994), 89–102. For a delineation of its theoretical dimensions, see Alexis Sanderson, “History through Textual Criticism in the Study of Śaivism, the Pañcarātra and the Buddhist Yoginītantras,” in Les Sources et le Temps, ed. F. Grimal (Pondicherry: Institut Français d’ Indologie/École française d’ Extrême-Orient, 2011), 1–47. 86I was myself introduced to this approach while having the privilege of studying under Somadeva Vasudeva. 
122 
even from a distance, Alexis Sanderson has helped to make all of us better readers in the 
Sanskrit sources. 
It is the second contribution, however, that will ultimately have the most profound and 
lasting impact on the study of the religions of Asia. What Sanderson, and those who have 
responded to his preliminary research from their own methodological position within the STS 
collective,87 have made evident is that far from representing a marginal dimension of the study 
87For more than a decade prior to the publication of “The Śaiva Age” (2009), a case, emerging from within the STS collective, was already being made for the centrality of Tantric religion to the study of greater South Asia, first proffered by David White implicitly in The Alchemical Body (1996) and then much more pointedly in the introduction to Tantra in Practice (2000) and Kiss of the Yogini (2006). David Gordon White, The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996); David Gordon White, Kiss of the Yoginī: “Tantric Sex” in its South Asian Contexts (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006), 1–3. The introduction to the latter of these, whose conceptual project the present work seeks to extend into a range of additional geographical and demographic domains, is worth quoting in full: 
“The life of Tantric practitioners has never been limited to textual exegesis alone; nor has it been solely concerned with the fabrication of worship images or the ritual propitiation of the Tantric pantheon. Yet such is the impression one receives when one reads one or another of the types of scholarly literature on the subject. Here, by paralleling these three types of data, as well as attending to accounts of Tantric practice and practitioners found in the medieval secular literature, I intend to reconstruct a history as well, perhaps, as a religious anthropology, a sociology, and a political economy of (mainly Hindu) Tantra, from the medieval period down to the present day. In so doing, I will also lend serious attention to human agency in the history of Tantra in South Asia. Most of the South Asian temples upon which Tantric practices are depicted in sculpture were constructed by kings—kings whose involvement in Tantric ritual life is irrefutable. When the king is a Tantric practitioner and his religious advisers are Tantric “power brokers,” how does this impact the religious and political life of his kingdom? What is the relationship between “popular” practice and “elite” exegesis in the Tantric context? What has been the relationship between “pragmatic” and “transcendental” religious practice in South Asia? These are questions whose answers may be found in texts and in stone, in medieval precept as well as modernday practice. This book will grapple with these questions, and in so doing resituate South Asian Tantra, in its precolonial forms at least, at the center of the religious, social, and political life of India and Nepal. For a wide swath of central India in the precolonial period, Tantra would have been the “mainstream,” and in many ways it continues to impact the mainstream, even if emic misappreciations of Tantra tend to relegate it to a marginal position. In present-day Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet, Tantra remains the mainstream form of religious practice. . . . 
For what reformist Hindus and the scholars who have followed their revisionist history of South Asian religion have in fact done has been to project—backward onto over two millennia of religious history, and outward onto the entire population of South Asia—the ideals, concerns, and categories of a relatively small cadre of Hindu religious specialists, literati, and their mainly urban clientele. While it is the case that those same elites—the brahmin intelligentsia, a certain Indian aristocracy, and the merchant classes—have been the historical bearers of much of Indian religious civilization, their texts and temples have had limited impact on the religious culture of the vast majority of South Asians. . . . The distorting effect of the hegemonic voices of these elites on the ways that twentieth-and now twenty-first-century India has imagined its past has been the subject of no small number of scholarly works, if not movements, over the past twenty-five years. The critical (or postcolonialist, or subalternist) approach to Indian historiography has been quite successful in deconstructing colonial categories. Where it has markedly failed—postmodernisme oblige?—has been in generating other nonelite, noncolonial (i.e., subaltern) categories through which to interpret the history of Indian culture. Yet such a category exists and is 
123 
of religion in Asia, the history of religion in South, South-East, and East Asia during the 
classical period cannot be responsibly told apart from a concerted focus on the Tantric 
knowledge systems and the life-worlds they engendered. In fact, when it comes to the study of 
South Asia in particular, the primary recoverable history of the religions we now label 
Hinduism from at least the sixth century up to the Islamic encounter is essentially the story of 
the various Tantric traditions and their antecedents among the traditions of the Atimārga. 
Succinctly, Śaivism and the traditions it inspired to recast its own image formed the religious 
mainstream. Though it has yet to be received as such by the wider study of South Asia, this 
discovery represents an unprecedented historiographical revolution, in that it proposes that the 
core interpretive context we have been using for thinking about “Brāhmaṇical religion” in pre- 
Islamic South Asia is basically wrong. Even the most cursory reading of “The Śaiva Age” 
confronts the reader with a preponderance of documentary evidence that the vast majority of 
the history of the Sanskrit cosmopolis—of Sanskrit literary composition within courtly settings 
and pugilistic public intellectual contestation—takes place against a backdrop of an elite 
culture where the most powerful and prestigious social agents tend to be initiates into the 
possessed of a cultural history that may be—and in many cases has been— retrieved through literary, art historical, and ethnographic research. That category, that cultural phenomenon, is Tantra, the occulted face of India’s religious history. In many ways the antitype of bhakti—the religion of Indian civilization that has come to be embraced by nineteenth-to twenty-first-century reformed Hinduism as normative for all of Indian religious history—Tantra has been the predominant religious paradigm, for over a millennium, of the great majority of the inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent. It has been the background against which Indian religious civilization has evolved.” David Gordon White, Kiss of the Yoginī, 1–3. 
In response to this magisterial vision, apart from engaging with a rather different archive centered not in northern, Himalayan, and central India but in the part of the subcontinent that falls on the other side of the Narmadā River, the present work offers some caveats. Fundamentally it questions the centrality of kings, kingdoms, and their courts as the primary causal agents in the dissemination of Tantric knowledge systems and as primary builders of Tantric material realities, proposing in their place a rather different and more diffuse sociality rooted in strong epistemic and methodological claims that make possible the worldly inculcation of Tantric imaginaries. At the same time, it also seeks to demonstrate that what White has labelled Hindu “reformism” and has associated with primarily colonial era transformations in knowledge and practice in fact represents a recoverable precolonial history of the deliberate and systematic occlusion of the dominant Tantric imaginaries of early medieval India that plays a formative role in the conceptualization and institutionalization of key antecedents to what is often taken to constitute “mainstream Hinduism.” 
124 
Tantric knowledge systems.88As a point of comparison, it is almost as if the study of medieval 
Europe had for centuries proceeded without any recognition of the existence of the medieval 
Christian church, let alone any reflection on how either its core doctrinal claims or specific 
elements of a hitherto undocumented and itself internally diversified Christian canon might 
have shaped the life-worlds of medieval Europeans. 
In his most recent work, Sanderson’s path of inquiry has gravitated towards moving 
beyond taking the prescriptive textual corpus he has reconstructed at face value, to increasingly 
incorporating documentary records, thinking about Tantra across religions and its transmission 
outside of South Asia, the regional historicization of Indian Śākta and Śaiva traditions—even 
drawing upon ethnography—all in the service of recovering the multivalent quotidian realities 
that lie behind scriptural imaginaries. In other words, in the second decade of twenty-first 
century, the research program of the Oxford collective has effectively converged with the 
founding vision of its American counterpart in a manner that will hopefully make possible 
more productive exchanges across the boundaries of very different institutional expectations. 
Nevertheless, at the very same time—indeed often in the very same texts—where such 
scholarship marshals copious evidence for reframing the institutional and conceptual realities 
of first millennium Indian religions as primarily to be accessed through lens of a Śaiva Age, 
even authors as sophisticated as Sanderson have continued to transmit and perpetuate the 
undigested residue of inherited historiographies, which simply presume the existence of a 
88For all of the brilliant recoveries and reconstructions “The Śaiva Age” offers of specific Tantric traditions found in other parts of the Tantric Age, in my experience it has been Sanderson’s systematic assemblage of documentary evidence, dynasty by dynasty, demonstrating that virtually every political authority known to Indology is imbricated in Tantric knowledge that has had the biggest impact on newly convincing readers outside of Tantric Studies, even those skeptical of Religious Studies in general, of the centrality of Tantric knowledge to classical Indian civilization. 
125 
unified and institutionally empowered “mainstream Brāhmaṇical religion.”89 It is in response 
to this “Brāhmaṇical” cultural form and its institutions and juridical norms, we are told, that 
Śaivas had to carve out an identity. The spatial foundations of this discourse, purportedly, are 
the long standing “Brāhmaṇical land grants,” identified as such, in the absence of temple 
donations, by the bestowal of dāna to social agents bearing “Brāhmaṇa” sounding names (x- 
śarman), the occasional ritual derived title (Atirātrin or Somayājin), and the genealogical 
markers of gotra and pravara. And though these documentary texts in and of themselves 
typically contain no specific theological or doctrinal content whatsoever, even in the 
Sandersonian corpus, there is nascent assumption that the ideological contents of such 
communities can be readily identified. In practice, what we find on offer is a very narrow 
cutting indeed off the many branches of the tree of Brāhmaṇical knowledge. Effectively, when 
the anachronism of its equation with Advaita Vedānta has been set to the side, “Brāhmaṇical 
ideology” is comprised of the epistemology and valuations of Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā, fused with the 
language ideology of Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya, and then governed by the juridical and social 
norms prescribed by something called “Dharmaśāstra” (in actuality, almost entirely limited to 
a cursory engagement with the Mānavadharmaśāstra). This whole concoction is then held 
together by something called “Brāhmaṇical religion,” with its own specialized religious agents, 
modes of praxis, and textual authorities. The working presumption is that, probably from its 
89Thus, for example, Sanderson writes even in his most recent publication: “It was necessary also to seek to understand how the Śaivas had understood and negotiated the relationship between their Śaiva obligations and those of mainstream brahmanical religion and the extent to which the latter had accepted or rejected its claims. As one would expect, it became clear that this relationship was subject to change and was far from constant across the range of the Śaiva traditions in different regions and periods and that the history of Śaivism was in important respects the history of this unstable relationship.” Sanderson, “How Public Was Śaivism,” 3. For all of its invocations of the plasticity of the interrelationship between Śaivism and “mainstream Brāhmaṇical religion,” such an approach still seems to be presupposing that there is already in existence a unified “mainstream Brāhmaṇical religion” discourse with which the historically fluid life-worlds of Śaivism interact.

inception, but at least by the time of the Guptas when we can begin to reconstruct parallel 
histories concerning the predecessors of Tantric knowledge within the Atimārga, these currents 
amount to complementary facets of a unified system of knowledge and values in which the 
social agents we identify as “Brāhmaṇas” necessarily, to at least some degree, would have 
participated. 
In essence, when the two fields of inquiry we have just been surveying converge, we 
meet with a single story: the ending of the Śaiva Age coincided, and not at all coincidentally, 
with a pivotal moment in the transformations of Brāhmaṇical knowledge systems and religions 
as well as of the core epistemic claims they promulgated. Indeed, the very nature of the Śaiva 
Age—whose vast and varied prescriptive textual canons both reflect and instantiate a 
pluralistically imagined India, in which knowledge and power are wielded by a wide array of 
social agents, whose scope of influence is site- and community-specific—itself has to be 
rethought. Succinctly, we should not understand it as an unexpected interruption in the longue 
durée history of Brāhmaṇical social and ideological hegemony. For, when we disaggregate the 
evidence from an ahistorical narrative of “Brāhmaṇism as a timeless religious essence,” what 
comes into focus is that it was only with the dismantling of the institutions and life-worlds of 
the Mantramārga, its antecedents and aspirational successors, and the suppression of the 
outsized cultural influence of the social forms that they had come to epitomize, that the 
conditions of possibility come into play for something resembling a unified “Brāhmaṇical” 
religion that assumes regulatory capture over the quotidian implementation of religious life 
above and beyond the boundaries of site- and community-specific practice. 
This then, is the tale of how dharma was reimagined as universal. Its protagonist, kept 
off-stage waiting in the wings until well into the third act, is that peculiar polymath 
127Dharmaśāstrin, Hemādri Sūri. Our setting, requiring extensive introduction, is the early 
medieval Deccan and its largely occluded institutional norms and social forms. With this 
program serving as your itinerary, now is the perfect occasion to the commence the epic tale 
(approaching the length of the Mahābhārata) of the ending of the Śaiva Age and the invention 
of modern “Brāhmaṇism.”

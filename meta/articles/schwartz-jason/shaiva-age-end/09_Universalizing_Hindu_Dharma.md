Reinventing the Western Deccan: The Seuṇa Sea Change 
In 2002, in the small town of Hatnur in rural Marathwada, the temple-trust responsible 
for the management and preservation of the early fourteenth-century Nāganātha temple 
undertook an ambitious program of renovation and refurbishment. Though the project was 
meticulously documented, for the historian or even the aficionado of heritage, the end result 
was something of a mixed blessing. On the one hand, one of the few surviving examples of a 
completely intact early medieval stone śikhara in the region—which had apparently become 
structurally unsound—was replaced by a colorful slender spire replicating the style preferred 
by the Marāṭhas in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

Hatnur, Nāganātha, after the renovation in 2002. 
More constructively, in removing many centuries of debris and overgrowth, the committee’s 
efforts uncovered the full extent and majesty of Hatnur’s enormous stepwell (S. puṣkariṇī, M. 
bārava). With a tank that could comfortably accommodate three or four Nāganāthas, in both 
1259 
scale and sophistication, its execution overshadows the rather plain and austere temple. 
Despite being located in a place that even today is scarcely inhabited, barely reachable 
by road, and somewhat desolate, the sheer scale of Hatnur’s stepwell echoes back to a time 
when traditional methods of irrigation, feeding into this vast tank, would have made the desert 
bloom. Perhaps this would have allowed for the support of a much larger population, 
comprised of a mixture of locals and pilgrims. While the temple itself was built in the reign of 
the Seuṇa Yādava King Rāmacandra, during a peculiar moment when he had temporarily 
reasserted his independence from the Delhi Sultanate, this step well is several centuries older. 
Even in its diminished condition, one has only to look at the surviving ornamental work on the 
edges of the stepwell, which introduces elegant and flowing lines into the stone, to say nothing 
of the remnants of the relief and sculptural components that would have been incorporated 
therein, to recognize a hand far finer than the one that shaped Nāganātha.

explored in the preceding chapter. Indeed, despite their vast divergence in focus skill level and 
style, Hatnur’s Nāganātha incorporates into its ceilings some visual features reminiscent of the 
otherwise unattested byzantine abstract geometrical formations one also finds at Charthana in 
the temple that celebrates Matsyendranātha in its garbhagṛha. As we explored in the previous 
chapter, Charthana’s temples, all of which incorporate numerous figurative and often narrative 
representations onto their pillars and most of which also present us with images of a wide range 
of esoteric deities and yogins, represented both in the round and in relief, were likely to have 
been constructed around the early portions of the thirteenth century. In other words, within 
precisely the same geographical region and in less than a hundred years, both what temples 
represented and how they were built altered suddenly, and—as the older style and prowess

Look at its blocky, almost polygonic Gaṇeśa— 
the only figurative work incorporated into this 
Seuṇa complex. Clearly, something must have 
happened in the intervening centuries that 
precipitated this marked shift in the aesthetic 
and visual culture. 
Just how drastic this transition must have 
been becomes evident when we recognize that 
Hatnur’s Nāganātha lies only fifteen miles to 
the south of the temples at Charthana that we

In this regard, Hatnur is hardly unusual. Quite frequently, as I have discovered time 
and again in his travels within what was once Seuṇa territory, trusts overseeing rather tame 
late thirteenth-century Hemadpanthi temples engage in beautification projects that demand the 
draining of temple tanks only to discover that the bottom is often full of traces of a very 
different sort of material culture. 
Thus, for example, the mahārāj who tends the temple at Parde Darda an hour from 
1263 
was never to resurface— 
irrevocably. 
Thanks to the efforts of the 
Hatnur Temple Trust, we are in a 
position to recognize that this 
rupture in both the visual style and 
sophistication of technique finds 
its almost exact counterpart in a 
change in religious sensibilities. In 
dredging up the bottom of temple 
tank, much to their surprise, the 
work crews under the direction of 
trustees found the deliberately 
broken remnants of older, larger, 
and somewhat ferocious images

śivaliṅga also built in the reign of Rāmachandra—recovered from the temple tank on the edge 
of the property a treasure trove of older images that now fill his temple’s courtyard. Perhaps 
most memorably, these include an immense and highly unusual Rāṣṭrakūṭa style portrait of a 
dagger-bearing queen or female ascetic who holds a skull bowl in her right hand. Much as we 
have seen in our other case studies, Hatnur is of special interest not because it markedly 
diverges from the dynamics of its day, but because it provides us with a published paper trail 
associated with a corpus of material cultural evidence. Taken as whole, and read in relation to 
parallels at other places, this archive tells a surprisingly straightforward and unified story.

In both its form and content, the inscription at Hatnur1140 breaks from the chancellery 
scribal conventions of the medieval Deccan. Not only is it written in old Marathi instead of 
old Kannada or Sanskrit, but it has been executed by an artisan (S. sūtradhāra, M. sūtāru) who 
writes in a rather sloppy hand, did not bother to measure out the space where his inscription 
was to be located before he began engraving, is seemingly unaware of the existence of the 
anusvāra, and who somehow managed to misspell the name of his own profession (M. sūtārū) 
as well as the common word for temple (presadu for prāsādu). Nevertheless, the intention 
behind the inscription is quite clear. An authority named Puruṣadevapaṇḍit, a figure who, as 
this chapter will demonstrate, was infinitely more likely to have been a householder Brāhmaṇa

1266 
As one enters the temple of Nāganātha, the 
devotee is confronted with the following 
Old Marathi inscription, riddled with 
irregular spellings and scrawled in an 
indifferent hand, which awkwardly occupies 
an entire panel on the entry way pillar: 
Oṃ saku. 1223 pḷava saṃcchare. puruṣudeo paṇḍiti [sic. paṇḍitiṃ] nāganāthācā presadu [sic. prāsādu] kelā vridhhi keli sutārū [sic. sūtārū] Harī deo. Oṃ nāganātha namastu. 
In the Śaka year 1223, [in the reign of Rāmachandra Yādava], the temple of Nāganātha was made and renovated by Puruṣodeopaṇḍita. The artisan was Harīdeo. Oṃ: Benedictions to Nāganātha. 
than a Śākta ascetic, enlisted an artisan with the strikingly Vaiṣṇava name of Harīdeo to both 
make (kelā) and “renovate” (vriddhi keli) a temple dedicated to Nāganātha. This combination 
of making and renovating is itself highly irregular, and not just because it is redundant. No 
matter how extensive the changes that are being made, when speaking of a single structure, 
inscriptional records in the Deccan speak either of the renovation of an existing temple or the 
construction of a new one. In light of the nature of Harīdeo’s project, one is tempted to see our 
artisan as employing these dual verbs with the intention of communicating something quite 
similar to the modern real estate idiom of “gut-renovating” a newly purchased “tear-me-down” 
home where the majority of the value lies in the property underneath the structure itself.

unmistakably crafted in the same style and material as the water tank—was preserved by 
Harīdeo. Everything else was deliberately torn down.

What our visual 
evidence seems to 
suggest is that under 
Puruṣadeva’s direction, 
only the old black stone 
platform, which had 
rested underneath the 
prior structure housing 
the goddess and 
Bhairava—At a nearby town with the evocative name of Gosai Pimpaleswar, where the 
Mahānubhāvika sant Cakradhar once dwelt for an extended period of time, though we are 
lacking in inscriptions, a similar visual dynamic is in evidence. Here again the temple itself is 
exceptionally plain, though in this case efforts seem to have been made to incorporate some 
portions of the older “original structure.”

Once again, a monumental but very simple crude structure occupies a space that had until 
recently been defined by a different aesthetic, grounded in a much more intricate and precise 
visual language, executed with greater skill, and communicating Śākta-Śaiva values. The 
grounds at Gosai Pimpaleśvara not only preserves beautifully rendered images of Bhairava and

his associates, but we are also lucky to have access to some of the portraits of the “gosāvīs”— 
most likely Kālamukha ācāryas and sādhakas—that adorned the original structure, looking 
down from on high upon the devotees. We can be sure that this was the original arrangement 
because, despite some ideologically inconvenient iconography, the thirteenth-century 
renovation of the site was intent upon preserving the older temple’s garbhagṛha. Perhaps 
because the end result would have been an eyesore and the engineers lacked the skills necessary 
to preserve the worship space intact, they preserved the most nondescript of the yogins in situ 
on its back wall and the door guardians inside.

As the inscription from Hatnur tells us, Nāganātha was constructed in the year 1301 
CE, during a brief period when the Seuṇa Yādava ruler Rāmachandra—in the absence of his 
ostensible foreign overlord Alauddin Khilji (who had conquered Devgiri in 1296 and then 
promptly vanished from the Deccan)—attempted to reassert independent rule. As one of nine 
significant dated inscriptions issued under the regnal year of the dynasty before Khilji returned 
from his military conquests in north India in 1308 CE1141 and resumed more direct oversight, 
1141Here again we follow the index produced by Raikar, about which one should consult chapter 8. Some of these entries, as well as some of the evidence proceeding them, are of enough interest to warrant citing in full. See Appendix A of Yashavant Anant Raikar, Yadavas of the Deccan and their Times: A Cultural History PhD diss., University of Baroda, 1964). With the arrival of Khilji in 1293 CE, the Seuṇa court ceases to issue new grants or to interfere directly in the administrative affairs of outside institutions. The inscriptional record from 1293–1300 CE is sparse, and those marked in the regnal year of Seuṇa King are either hero stones or reference the internal affairs of institutions. The important exception is a document from 1294 CE, which delineates the final stages in the institutional overall of the Kālamukha center of Balligave, with a military commander who is an Āyurvedic 
1273 
it is a testament to the priorities and vision of both the Seuṇas and the local powers that paid 
them homage. All of these texts, provided they do not commemorate an untimely death, 
doctor by descent, aligned with Seuṇa court, overseeing the redistribution of land as well as the transfer of administrative control out of the hands of Kālamukha institutions. As will become clear when you have reached this chapter’s end, this document (which will be examined closely in future work) represents the culmination of Hemādri’s legacy. 
No. 463: “MASR (1929)124.no. 57 Kannada A.D. 1294: Belgami inscription, Saka 1216 (or 1218).

It refers to one Mahmud Prosrahi a ruler under Kanharadeva-the feudatory and general of Ramacandra Yadava. Some income has been assigned to a mosque. It is the only Yadava inscription referring to a mosque.” Rāmachandra issues a single inscription, in support of a mosque in 1298 CE, the year Devgiri is brought under Khilji’s control. The inscriptional record only resumes at the very end of 1300 CE, when Khilji has gone north and the Seuṇas resume acting as quasi-independent agents.

Baideva is recorded to have repaired the temple of Natesvara Jogesvara in Velapura which was situated in the Mana country.” Here we see an instance of the “renovation” of a temple dedicated to a Śākta-Śaiva form of the dancing Śiva into a Hemadpanthi temple.

The last is recorded to have built a monastery and some rooms near Vatesvara at Velapura in the Mana Country. The writer was Maideva, the son of Damodara Pandita.” Here we see another instance of the “renovation” and deinstitutionalization of preexisting Śākta-Śaiva center, in this case resulting in its acquisition by the lineage of the old Marathi yogin/sant Caṅgadeva Vāṭeśvara, the disciple of Muktāyoginī.

resume the very same project. They reimagine the sacred landscape of the Deccan, the terms 
of its administration, as well as the dominant patterns of land ownership and patronage. Often 
implicitly, but many cases quite explicitly, they set out to dismantle the epistemic frames we 
have been exploring for the past thousand pages, erasing the Kālamukhas and comparable 
property-holding Śākta-Śaiva communities from the pages of history. 
As we will see through cases drawing upon documentary records in old Marathi, 
Sanskrit and old Kannada, sometimes this is accomplished through direct armed interventions 
into the previously sacrosanct domain of long established undying land grants, the forcible 
eviction of the governing Śākta-Śaiva authorities, the conversion of the grant into a taxable 
property under the purview of the state, and the installation of a new managerial class, usually 
comprised of Brāhmaṇas.1142 In place of the well-worn formulas identifying the Kālamukhas 
to which we have grown so accustomed, we find instead emphatic evocations of the 
unimpeachable orthopraxy and impeccable ethical comportment of the pious Brāhmaṇas. 
Instead of merely hailing from Vedic gotras, the figures in question are depicted as actively 
engaged in the practice of Śrauta ritual. And where we would expect appeals to specific 
samayas and the doctrines of Lākulas and āgamas, the text extol the virtues of the study and 
Hariharēśvara of Davanagere was previously a Śākta-Śaiva center dedicated to the training of śilpins following the tradition of the Piṅgalāmata that belonged to a lineage connected to that of the Āvaḷi-following Kālamukhas of Kukkunur under the direction of Kaḷēśvara. Under the Seuṇa King Kandharaya the Kālamukhas are driven out and the site is “restored into the hands of Brāhmaṇas.” This inscription suggests that under Ramachandra’s rule, the Harihara at the center of the temple is identified with Viṭṭhal of Pandharpur and Vaiṣṇavized. 1142 In select cases that require much more detailed investigation in the future, this same role is played instead by Śivabrāhmaṇas who are the formative antecedents of key parts of later Vīraśaiva traditions who do not reject temple worship, especially the lineages of Siddharāmeśvara of Sonnalige and Śivadeva of the Muktēśvara temple at Cauḍadānapura. Both figures were likely given a pass because, as is represented by the thirteenth-century Kannada poet Rāghavaṅka in his Siddharāmacarita, figures such as this played an instrumental role in uprooting the Bhairava Siddhānta from the regions that fell under their oversight. Indeed, though the literature has scarcely acknowledged this except in passing, the early history of the Vīraśaiva traditions in the western Deccan that is recoverable in pre-fourteenth-century sources is almost entirely occurring under the direct patronage of the Seuṇa Kings, beginning from the reign of Bhillama VI. In fact, the inscriptional record contains roughly thirty examples of proto-Vīraśaiva vacanas, many of them transmitted in both Sanskrit and Kannada. For more on this corpus and its relation to the Vīramāheśvaras at Srisailam, see the forthcoming monograph of Elaine Fisher. 
1275 
teaching of Advaita Vedānta. In the vast majority of cases, however, it is the sudden silences 
in our documentary record that cry out to us as places that had received unbroken reverence 
from every sort of ruler in the Deccan for many hundreds of years suddenly and permanently 
disappear from our records. 
Quite specific and eminently recoverable conditions of possibility underwrite the Seuṇa 
Yādava reinvention of the preexisting and deeply Śākta sacred landscape. An introduction to 
this innovative interpretive project as well as the texture of the rewritten religious and 
institutional dynamics that will become increasingly predominant throughout the Seuṇa 
domain throughout the second half of the thirteenth century are compellingly conveyed 
through a close and contextual reading of an old Marathi inscription embedded in an 
exceptionally remote place now called Unkeshwar.1143 Unkeshwar lies on the far edge of 
Marathwada near what is now the Telangana border. As late as the nineteenth century, the 
region was primarily home to Ādivāsis and jogīs, including traditions associated with the rasa 
siddhas. Apart from Mahur, sacred to the followers of Dattātreya and the Mahānubhāvikās, 
which lies an hour to the west, the area even today has no major cities and has yet to be the 
focus of any significant archaeological, ethnographic, or historical work, even within the 
modern Marathi academy. 
1143 For the Unhakadeva inscription, as it is listed, see S. Tulpule, Prācīna Marāṭhī Korīva Lekha (Pune: Pune Vidyapitha, 1973), 198–206. 
1276 
Unkeshwar: Entrance to the site. Stairs leading up the hill and past the fort to the hot springs. 
Unkeshwar: Behind the gate, Sūrya Kuṇḍ (left) is one of the sulphur-rich hot springs. The inscription from 1278 CE (center) is on the exterior of the extensively renovated Hemadpanthi temple. 
1277For a rather selective demographic of tourists, however, Unkeshwar’s contemporary 
significance is not a matter of heritage or piety but a question of chemistry —compelled by 
utter desperation. The site where our inscription stands is a built on top of the only active hot 
springs in eastern Maharashtra, and the high sulphur content of the boiling water is seen as 
having curative potential—or at the very least providing relief—to lepers and other people 
afflicted by diseases of the skin, whose families bring them there in hope of a miracle. Close 
to crashing waterfalls up among hills that are riddled with caves, for five miles in every 
direction around Unkeshwar one finds geothermal pockets that heat the water to at least a 
hundred degrees. The surrounding plains are so overabundant with mercury that the farmers 
worry about it poisoning the crops and the companies committed to extracting coal and gold 
out of the ground must take precautions as they dig because it periodically oozes up from the 
ground. Succinctly, for the siddhas of the early medieval world, the site we call Unkeshwar 
must have amounted to an alchemist’s dream. Though a matter of informed conjecture, our 
inscription from 1278 CE is complicit in the almost complete erasure of this lurid zeitgeist. For 
precisely the same reasons, it seeks to manicure and domesticate even the classical Sanskrit 
tradition in the service of promoting a new kind of “Hindu” ethos, actively mediated through 
the prestige and authority of the state. The inscription reads as follows: 
Oṃ, Salutations to Gaṇeśa! In the auspicious Śaka year 1201, known of as Vikrama Saṃvatsara, during the reign of the vigorous mighty one, auspicious Rāmacandradeva the Cakravartin, on this very day—right here—subsisting on the feet of him, the master of elephants—“bhāvakadeva”1144—the chief minister Hemādipaṇḍita, the officer under his [Hemādri’s] direction (M. taṃniropītaḥ, S. tat-nirūpita), the nāeku (S. nāyaka), master scribe (M. kastu, S. kāyastha) Somadeyo Paṇḍita, at the time did it [i.e., oversaw the implementation of the grant as follows]: 
In the tretā yuga, Rāma on the occasion of dwelling in the forest, came to the āsramā (S. āśrama) of Sarabhaṅga. To please Sarabhaṅga, he made the spring water become hot (S. uṣṇa). Since that time, this tīrtha was made by the god. 
1144 On the intended referent of this term “bhāvakadeva,” see the analysis in the following pages. 
1278 
By the grace of Harihara, the one who dwells at Mātāpura, Saraṇanāeka, belonging to the Kaṇva sāṣā (s. śākhā) and Kauṇḍinyagotra, the son of Maghadeva, commenced the making of all the temples (M. sakalaprāsāda). By the grace of Rāma, he made it complete. His homage to Harihara, to the group of the thirty-three [Vedic] deities who dwell in the temples. Homage to all the tīrthas [gap]. Homage to all the three times [when sandhyā is performed]. Whoever reads this will be victorious!! 
The village of that place is a perpetual (M. nīti, S. nitya) designated land grant from the state (M. rājavaṭī, S. rājavṛtti).1145 Thus, the terms of the grant run as follows: 
On the surface a seemingly simple text, the first portion of the Unkeshwar inscription 
has much to teach us about the fundamental transformation of the relationship between religion 
and the state and the role played by Brāhmaṇas in popular worship under the last three Seuṇa 
kings, Kandharāya, Mahādeva, and Rāmacandra. We are witnessing here an extraordinary 
moment. On the edge of the Seuṇa Yādava domain, a duly credentialed (Kaṇva Śākhā, 
Kauṇḍinya Gotra) Brāhmaṇa named Saraṇa decides to undertake a program of massive 
investment in a sacred field, building a series of temples at a site sacred to Rāma. There is no 
acknowledgement of any preexisting religious institutions or infrastructure. Despite the fact 
that some of these are temples associated with Śiva and Rāma, the latter of whom is directly 
responsible for making the site sacred, Śiva is in absentia and Rāma himself is only responsible 
for the successful completion of the project. Instead, rather pointedly, the text twice attributes 
the capacity of the patron to undertake this project to the grace of Harihara, the distant god at 
Pandharpur whom our records show was heavily patronized both by the Seuṇa kings and his 
chief minister, and whose worship at this time suspiciously resembles a sort of state religion. 
1145S. Tulpule, Prācīna Marāṭhī Korīva Lekha (Pune: Pune Vidyapitha, 1973), 203–204: oṃ namo gaṇadhiāpataye[sic] namaḥ svastī srī sake //1201// vīkrama saṃvatsare : ādyeha : māhāprauḍhapratāpacakravarti : srīrāmacaṃdradeva : vijayo[emd. vijayī] tata[emd. tat]pādapadmopajivi : hāthisāhāṇī bhāvakade – va : pradhāna hemāḍi paṃḍita : // taṃniropīta : nāeku : kastu somadeyo paṃḍita : tasmiṃkāle vartamāne : // tretāyugīṃ rāmu : vanavāsaprasaṃgīṃ : sarabhaṅgāceā āsramā āle : sarabhaṃgāprītyartha : he udabhi udaka uṣla keleṃ : / tadā kālauṇi devaracīta tīrtha heṃ : harīharāṃprasādeṃ : mātāpuranivāsī : kaṇvasā – ṣāḥ kauḍaṇyagotra : saraṇunāeka : suteṃ meghadeveṃ : sakalaprāsādāraṃbhu kela : to rāmaprāsadeṃ saṃpūrṇa jālā : teyācā namaskāru : harīharāṃ tetīsā devāle devatāgaṇā : sakalāṃ tīrthāṃ – – – – namaskāru : trikāla // vācītā vijaiyā ho – – tethilaci grāmu // 1 // madhyamula nītī rājavaṭi // 
1279 
Similarly, instead of aligning with particularized “local” pantheons and concerns or the deities 
of specific social communities, as had been typical of the inscriptional records in the Deccan 
for centuries, the text tells us that these new temples, built by a non-resident Brāhmaṇa, will 
be housing the thirty-three Vedic deities, hardly popular focuses of veneration. 
Even in its invocation of its imagined classical pedigree, our inscription employs a 
certain sleight of hand in its deployment of canonical mythology. In both the Vālmīki 
Rāmāyāṇa and Kālidāsa’s Raghuvaṃśa,1146 Rāma’s brief encounter with the sage Śarabhaṅga 
is one of the more bizarre moments in the epic. In the critical edition of the book of the forest, 
enroute to Citrakūṭa, the dying gandharva Tumburu encourages Rāma to swiftly seek out the 
āśrama of the sage Śarabhaṅga. This place lies along the Godāvarī river, which is to say 
roughly in the region of Maharashtra under discussion. As Rāma makes his way towards the 
sage’s āśrama, he sees radiant Indra and his chariots rushing towards Śarabhaṅga’s home. 
After many centuries of fierce austerities (ugreṇa tapasā), Śarabhaṅga, a great sage 
resplendent like the sun (maharṣiḥ sūryasaṃnibhaḥ), is getting ready to ascend into heaven. 
Thankfully, Rāma and his brother arrive just in time, right at the moment that Śarabhaṅga is 
about to step into the agnihotra fire and immolate himself. When he sees the descendants of 
Raghu, Śarabhaṅga is overjoyed and clasps their feet. The sage delights that he is there to 
welcome them, declares the moment most auspicious, and then, after offering them the 
hospitality of his house, he invites them to watch as he kills himself, shedding his body as a 
snake sloughs off its skin. Overbrimming with radiant tejas (mahātejas), Śarabhaṅga then steps 
into the sacrificial fire. It consumes his hair, flesh, and bones. Transformed into an elegant 
1146In Vālmīki, from the first reference to his āśrama to his self-immolation, the Śarabhaṅga episode spans from 3.003.022–3.005.001, or forty-three verses, only a fraction of which are actually dedicated to Śarabhaṅga himself. See Sheldon Pollock, trans., The Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki: An Epic of Ancient India, Volume III: Araṇyakāṇḍa (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1991).

youth, Śarabhaṅga’s radiant fiery spirit is seen ascending into heaven. In Vālmīki, Rāma is 
then welcomed by the Vaikhanāsa sages who dwell in that place, who encourage him to go kill 
some rākṣasas that have been troubling the region. For Kalidāsa and his ninth-century 
Kashmiri commentator Vallabhadeva, in contrast, the story of Śarabhaṅga primarily holds a 
didactic function.1147 The moral of the story is that, in much the same way that it is a breach of 
etiquette to eat without first offering hospitality and food to one’s guests, it also a śiṣṭa faux 
pas to be eaten—in this case by agni kravyāda, consumer of flesh—without first going through 
all the social niceties. 
In either case, in the classical reception histories of the story, Rāma and Śarabhaṅga 
share space for approximately five minutes and exchange fewer than eighty words. This is 
hardly enough time for Rāma to perform the miracle of the bubbling hot springs. Adding insult 
to injury, the very idea in the first place that Rāma making spring water become hot (M. udabhi 
udaka uṣḷa keleṃ) is the sort of thing that would please Śarabhaṅga (M. 
sarabhaṅgāprītyarthaḥ) belies even a passing exposure to the narrative. As we have seen, 
Śarabhaṅga does not exactly stick around long enough to be pleased by any additions to his 
āśrama. Perhaps even more significantly, the last thing in the world that a sage who is 
described as a miniature walking sun that constantly gives off ambient heat would need is 
someone else’s help in making things become hot. Much like Vālmīki himself, whose portrait 
of the “Vedic sage” Śarabhaṅga—elsewhere appearing as an ascetic in Buddhist literature— 
reads as an attempt at incorporating and sanitizing an external tradition of violent asceticism, 
in many ways akin to the proto-Tantroid worship of Rudra through self-immolation practiced

by Aśvatthāman in the Sauptikaparvan. The author of our inscription seems quite intent on 
forcibly taming—and Vedicizing—a much wider, wilder world. 
Though it contains some phrases that remain obscure, the purely documentary portion 
of our inscription1148 also seems to be animated by an analogous Brāhmaṇizing ethos. In regard 
to the main grant within the central village, this establishes funding for food offerings and so 
forth to be given to the unspecified deity that rules the village (grāmādhyedevo bonayāṃ 
sthala), allots two fields so that their earnings will go towards repairing broken buildings 
(cākulivāṃci tathā pa – sthalaḥ), and assigns one field to be cultivated by tenant farmers, with 
the proceeds going to the temple of Rāma for the first several years and any remainder in 
subsequent years being put towards the funding of festivals (adhīk māse bhaṃgaleā kī rāmāsī 
ekadoṇi saṃvatsaraparyaṃta so (mo?)ḍale teṃciṃ karāveṃ maga suṣe ure teṃ koṭhiā 
caṇeyā). In perpetuity, two additional villages are dedicated to providing financial support and 
material resources to the temples to Unhapakadeva and Rāma (tathā grāmi unhapa[ka]devāḥ 
rāmā mele : / dasīṇe pūrve boyṃthīye dohiṃ devāṃ malāḥ / sāṅgaviṃyeṃ dohiṃ devāṃ malā). 
In this regard, the grant prescribes the installation of at least two more liṅgas (liṅgāṃ dohi devā 
malā), and, micromanaging the landscape, establishes a storage house for cloth (paṭavadeṃ 
sthalaḥ), lamp oil (taleṣala), as well as endowments providing jaggery and sugar (kāmatu guḍā 
sthala / taleṣala kāpa sakāragavāṃ sthala). It rations out which materials from plots of land

containing different types of trees have their products allotted to the temple (ciṃcavalī sthala 
piṃpalajai sāṃgaviṃ sthala) and even specifies which plots of land are to self-cultivated or to 
be tended by hired labor. Rather distinctively, for this dimension has no earlier known parallels, 
it also grants in perpetuity a “fertile field each to the Brāhmaṇas engaged in the work [lit., the 
path] of the king,” (nāvaṃ mahuseta [S. madhukṣetra] teyāṃcī brāhmaṇā pratyai 
rājamārgici), a phrase that most likely refers to the main minister Hemāḍi and his deputy 
Somadeva Paṇḍita. 
The most stunning dimension of the Unkeshwar inscription, however, is the 
circumstances under which it was executed, for the text tells us at this remote place on the edge 
of Seuṇa world, the fulfillment of the grant was carried out in the presence of the master of 
elephants, whose identity we will discuss in a moment, the king’s most important (pradhāna) 
minister, Hemāḍi (S. Hemādri) Paṇḍita, and, acting under Hemādri and at his command, 
Somadeyo Paṇḍita, the lead administrator of the royal chancellery directing the scribes and 
record keepers. Now, as we have encountered ever so many time over the course of this study, 
in the context of the normative paradigm reflected in the documentary records of the early 
medieval Deccan, the establishment of a land-grant upon the building of a new temple entails 
both acts of dakṣiṇā on the part of the most prominent figures present as well as the transfer, 
either in person or in absentia, of the sovereignty of the space from secular to sacerdotal 
authorities an act marked by the washing of the feet of the local authority or ācārya. In 
contradistinction, at Unkeshwar, none of the authorities present seem to be contributing 
anything at all—neither land nor resources—to the grant itself, either of their own accord or 
behalf of the state. Despite this being listed as an undying land-grant, there is no indication that 
sovereign authority has been transferred from the state to a new agent, or that the recipient of 
1283 
the grant has been endowed with new rights or no longer has to pay taxes. Instead, it seems 
that these high-ranking agents of the state are simply there to ensure that everything is being 
done according to the proper procedure, as part of a process that our prescriptive sources will 
call examination (parīkṣā). 
In his edition as well as his earlier partial translation1149 of the Unkeshwar inscription, 
Tulpule has assumed that for the inauguration of Saraṇanāeka’s new temple complex, four 
distinctive social actors were in attendance representing the Seuṇa Yādava state. In Tulpule’s 
reading, these would include King Rāmacandra himself, the master of elephants, purportedly 
a certain Bhāvakadeva, the chief minister Hemāḍi Paṇḍita, who as we shall see is none other 
than the great Brāhmaṇa polymath and author of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, and finally, acting 
explicitly under Hemāḍi’s authority, Somadeyo Paṇḍita, the leader of the scribes and record 
keepers. If, however, one examines the contemporary multilingual Seuṇa Yādava inscriptional 
corpus from this precise period, say, from the years 1260–1280 CE, attending to chancellery 
formulas and syntactical commonalities, as we shall see, it is evident that Tulpule is mistaken 
in respect to two rather significant details. Small as they might seem, they will have an 
enormous impact on the argument of the present chapter. His edition and translation of the 
second line reads as follows. The matters of contention have been highlighted in bold: 
adyeha māhāprauḍhapratāpacakravartī śrīrāmacandradevaḥ vijayo tatapādapadmopajivi hāthisāhāṇī bhāvakadeva pradhāna hemāḍi paṇḍita taṃniropītaḥ nāekuḥ kastu somadeyo paṇḍita. 
Today, in the auspicious Śaka year 1201, known of as Vikrama Saṃvatsara, the paramount sovereign, possessing great valour, Śrī Rāmacandradeva, with his devoted chief of the elephant division of the army [Bhāvakadeva], Minister Hemāḍi Paṇḍita, 
1149Tulpule presented a translation of selection portions of the Unkeshwar inscription in 1960 as part of his Old Marathi Reader. See S. G. Tulpule, An Old Marathi Reader: Edited with Grammatical Introduction, English Translation, Notes, and Glossary (Pune: Venus Prakashana, 1960), 91 – 94. Subsequently, in editing the text for his Pracīna Marāṭhī Korīva Lekha, he revised a number of his readings in transcribing the inscription. My translation relies upon the revised text. 
1284 
and the deputy of the latter, Nāyaka Kāyastha Somadeva Paṇḍita, in his time [the present grant is made].1150 
Tulpule believes that the Seuṇa Yādava king Rāmacandradeva was himself present at 
Unkeshwar solely because he rather unexpectedly construes the word that follows the king’s 
canonical list of titles—vijayo—as modifying the noun Rāmacandra—victorious 
Rāmachandra. This interpretation would place the king as one subject among many in the list 
of officials that soon follows. What Tulpule has overlooked is that this portion of the text is 
simply offering a shorthand form of an inherited chancellery formula signifying the date.1151 
Within this convention, the name of the reigning king and his titles is immediately 
followed by a term such as vijayodaya, or vijayarājya, one occasionally even sees just vijaya, 
and the sense is that this is an expression akin to the Western calendrical notion of measuring 
time “in the year of our Lord.” In much the same way that if someone in medieval Europe were 
to speak of something happening in their hometown “in the Year of Our Lord 1290,” he or she 
would very much not be implying that Jesus Christ was present in the flesh right then in that 
very village, when a land grant in old Marathi refers to the regnal year, it is not invoking the 
actual presence of the king onsite. In Sanskrit, we would express this sort of meaning, which 
postulates a continuing state of affairs co-current with the actual matter under discussion, using 
an extended locative absolute. More than mere pedantry, this observation—that King 
Rāmacandra is present only in name and that other people are carrying out the affairs of the 
1150 For Tulpule’s translation of select portions of the Unkeshwar inscription, see Tulpule, An Old Marathi Reader, 92. 1151 Here, also testifying to the irregularity of old Marathi spelling and word formation, are some select examples: śrī Someśvaradevarāyakalyāṇāvijayarājye (Śilāhara King of the Koṅkaṇa, 1260 CE) śrīmatu prauḍha- pratāpacakravarttīr śrīrāmacandradevarāya vijayodaye tatpādapadmopajivi māhāmaṇḍaleśva (Kālāvāra inscription); śrīmatpraudhapratāpacakravartti śrīrāmacandradeva vijayodayī tatpā -dpadmopajivī śrījāīdeva (Akṣi inscription); śrīmat prauḍhapratāpacakravartī śrīrāmacandradeva vijayodaye tatpādapadmopajivi sakalasainyādhipati sarvādhikāri māhāmaṇḍaleśvara śrīkānharadeva taṃniropita (Bombay, 1297 CE); śrīmatpraudhapratāpacakravartti śrīrāmacandradeva vijayarājyodayī tadpādapadupajīvī sarvādhikārī śrījoideva taṃniropita brahmadeorāṇo (Velur, 1300 CE). 
1285 
state—does not merely just set the stage for making sense of the other major place in this 
passage where Tulpule has gone astray. It also communicates something of vital interest about 
the actual workings of political authority within the Yādava state. Almost without exception, 
in both our documentary record and the old Marathi and Sanskrit texts, after 1240 CE, the 
Seuṇas appear simply as ciphers. In fact, the king rarely if ever leaves his court and instead 
delegates most if not all of his authority to another person who then acts out in the world “as 
if he were the king himself.” 
As we have seen in our earlier chapters, apart from when they are discussing a ruling 
overlord (such as the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya emperor) in discussing other strata of authoritative 
persons, the multilingual inscriptional records of the past five centuries have typically 
presented us with lists comprised of a diverse range of social actors and offices. Often to our 
consternation, these figures bear the same or comparable titles and it is very difficult to figure 
out their relative authority in relation to each other. Though to some degree this is a reflection 
of our own ignorance of the workings of early medieval courts, it also almost certainly the case 
that in the social realities we have been exploring, authority is commonly conceptualized as 
multicentric and diffuse. This is reflected in the proliferation of types of cabinet positions in 
the royal court, with the Cāḷukyas, for example, recognizing sixteen distinctive subject and 
discipline specific advisory positions, each of which held governing authority only within their 
respective domain.1152 We have seen this pluralistic theorization of both knowledge and 
authority as site and community-specific at work in scholastic, juridical, mythological, 
theological, political, and social domains throughout our investigation. By now they may well 
1152 See, for example, G. C. Rayachaudhuri, History of the Western Cālukyas Part II: The Later Cālukyas of Kalyani and Aspects of Western Cālukya Administration (Calcutta, 1977). 
1286 
have become so familiar that one might see them as part and parcel of a Deccani ethos, 
unchallengeable norms written into the fabric of reality. 
One of the defining features of the Seuṇa imperium in the half-century after the death 
of Siṅghaṇa II is that at virtually every level of expression, these norms are repudiated, even 
actively dismantled. This interpretive choice is reflected in the Seuṇa inscriptions themselves. 
Suddenly, for the first time in centuries, the chancellery formulas are emended with the aim of 
clearly delineating levels of dependence and authority among different social actors. Thus, 
while, in theory, the absent king himself sits at the top of the food chain, in the inscriptions it 
is the figure who subsists (tatpādapadmopajīvi)—one might even say whose livelihood 
depends—on the feet of the king who is the actual acting authority. This figure—always a 
single person who is often given a chain of titles specifying what would otherwise seem to be 
a series of unrelated responsibilities, offices, and specific accomplishments—is then seen as 
having at least one active subordinate. This position marked by the phrase, given various 
spellings, “taṃniropita,” followed by that person’s name and titles. Tulpule observes in his 
dictionary1153 that tan-niropita/niropīta is a tadbhava form of the Sanskrit phrase tat-nirūpita, 
and while this is certainly true, one might suppose that the identification of this exact parallel 
entails that its programmatic usage in these old Marathi documentary records is transposed 
from the Sanskrit sources. Rather unexpectedly, however, digital corpus analysis of a 
substantial sampling of literature in Sanskrit as well as inscriptions makes it clear that not only 
is such a usage in this context seemingly unattested, but in fact the terms tannirūpita, 
tatnirūpita or tadanurūpita up through this time period are virtually never used in reference to

1287people or within a social setting. Instead, they are almost exclusively attested within high 
scholastic discourses, especially works of Navya Nyāya or discussions of the logic of 
figuration in Sanskrit poetics. In this context, they are terms of art signifying the absolutely 
determined subordination and logical dependency of one precisely specified thing over 
another, with the dominant subject being whatever is the intended referent of the pronoun “tat.” 
In short, what we have here is an example of a synthetic attempt to transpose the “artificial” 
logical clarity found in certain exalted registers of Sanskrit scholasticism down into the messy 
and imperfect world of human experience. As we shall see, this is precisely the interpretive 
project that occupies the majority of textual production in the court of the later Seuṇas 
themselves and that practically defines the oeuvre of the iconoclastic poetician, Dharmaśāstrin, 
public intellectual, administrator, and de facto ruler of the Seuṇa Yādava kingdom, Hemādri 
Sūri. 
Our examination of the Unkeshwar inscription as the product of a specific chancellery 
culture with highly regularized formulas also prepares us for wrestling with Tulpule’s more 
significant misinterpretation, namely, his posting of a certain “Bhāvakadeva” as the master of 
elephants (hāthisāhāṇī) who subsists on the feet of the king. Were we to accept this reading, 
this would presuppose the existence of an entirely different, and quite plausibly higher-ranking 
person than the chief minister, Hemādri. On the basis of textual parallels, however, there is 
good reason to understand “Bhāvakadeva” not as someone’s name, but as one of many 
adjectives qualifying the main subject, Hemāḍri, who is himself assigned the office of master 
of the elephants amidst his many other titles. Here, it is not the old Marathi corpus, but rather 
a nearly contemporary inscription1154 discussing Hemādri and his social role drawn from the

1288 
Sanskrit corpus1155 that offers our strongest evidence. Though the text is issued on behalf of 
both Rāmacandra and the “acting king” Hemādri in 1289 CE, both figures are discussed solely 
within distinctive sets of locative absolute constructions set off from the rest of the text. They 
were not present at the drafting and distribution of these copper plates. Instead, that task was 
assigned to their subordinate, a certain Acyuta Nāyaka, who happens to be the grandson of the 
famous Jalhaṇa, military commander, master of the elephants, and compiler of the poetic 
anthology the Sūktimuktāvali. In any case, the relevant passage runs as follow: 
Now while King Rāmacandra, moon to the lotuses of the Yadu race, brilliant with the series of all titles such as: “he who dries up the pools of the hostile monarchs’ glory by his most fierce heat [or, majesty], who adorns the girdles of the ladies of the quarters of space with lines of precious pearls arising his own stainless virtues, who displays the awfulness of a Nṛsimha by tearing open the surface of mighty foemen’s breasts, whose face-lotus is kissed by the bees which are the restless eye-corners of Śambara’s slayer [Kāma], who by his own arm has won the name Ekāṅgavīra, who is a treasury of all virtues, who is a Vīra-Nārāyaṇa to the demons his enemies, who by his life makes light of Grandsire [Brahman], a Grandsire of monarchs, who is the lord of the city of Dvāravatī, a lion shattering the elephants of the Gūrjara, an elephant in uprooting the tall trees of Tēliṅga, a blast of the Day of Doom in extinguishing the lamps of the Mālavas, a trees of desire possessing the virtue of liberality,” is reigning over the whole girdle of the earth; 
And, while Hemādri, superintendent of all the elephant riders (hastipakādhyakṣe) inspiring men to appreciate the fineness of his virtues (nijaguṇasubhaga[bhāvuke] 
1155 While the Old Marathi Unakadeva inscription we have been analyzing was issued in 1278 CE, the Sanskrit copper plate found in Thane district outside of Mumbai that offers the key textual parallel was issued in 1289 CE. As we shall see, we have documentary evidence for Hemādri holding the multifaceted position of chief minister and de facto ruler of the Seuṇa Yādava Kingdom from circa 1260, when the Caturvargacintāmaṇi was completed during the reign of King Mahādeva, until 1290 CE, when he last appears in our records. We know for certain that he was dead or least no longer in office in 1297 CE, for that is when a certain Joideva is depicted as having replaced him in his office. Given the enormous length of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, which proclaims Hemādri’s high office in every single one of its divisions, as well as documentary evidence for the implementation of policies first outlined in the CVC as early as 1245, it is plausible that the completion of the text may have taken as long as a decade, beginning during the reign of Kandharāya, during most if not all of which Hemādri held high office. Thus, we can conservatively suggest that Hemādri was a dominant influence in the court for thirty to forty years. I had originally intended to incorporate herein an exhaustive survey of the documentary records pertaining to Hemādri Sūri, a project that was largely outlined as early as 2014. In the time of Covid, however, it has become exceptionally difficult to reconsult all of the inscriptional evidence across all of the various different volumes in which it is contained to cross check notes and verify readings, as much of it is for in library use only. As a result, this project will have to wait for another occasion.

In the old Marathi inscription, the syntax in the phrase “hāthisāhāṇī bhāvakadevaḥ 
pradhāna hemāḍipaṇḍitaḥ” by itself is somewhat uncertain. As we have seen, it could refer to 
two distinct subjects, a master of elephants named Bhāvakadeva and the minister Hemāḍi 
Paṇḍita, or, as will turn out to be the case, it could offer a series of adjectives assigning specific 
roles to the single subject Hemādri. In contrast, the structure of the Sanskrit parallel, in which 
every compounded phrase placed in the locative must refer back to the single subject, is 
unambiguous. Here, we find, in precisely the same sequence, albeit with just a bit of further 
embellishment, that it is Hemādri that is being characterized as the one who holds the office of 
overseeing the elephants (hastipakādhyakṣe) and then, taking the compound literally, setting 
aside for a time its domain-specific connotations, “being the one whose good fortune is a 
product of his own good qualities” (nijaguṇasubhaga[bhāvuke]bhāvake).” While in the case 
1156Barnett, the editor and translator of this inscription, gives the conjectural reading “subhagam-bhāvuke bhāvake,” which clearly contains some sort of play on words, upon which he comments: “This is corrupt. Apparently, the sense demands something like °subhagatva-bhāvuka-bhāvake, and I have ventured to translate accordingly.” His editor, F.W.T, then adds in brackets: “[But subhagaṃ bhāvuka would be correct]. See Epigraphia Indica, Vol. XIII, pg. 202, ftn. 3. This later correction loses the deliberate play on words intended, which we might reconstruct as something like, “[Hemādri] is a literary connoisseur (bhāvaka) in regard to language full of emotion/rasa (bhāvuka) the good fortune from which is an expression of his own qualities.” While for anyone else, this sort of over-the-top bravado would be suspect and suggest a poor construal of the text, as we shall see in this chapter, for Hemādri, this mode of expression is entirely unexceptional. 1157For the translation, see Barnett’s edition of the “Thana Plates” in Epigraphia Indica, Vol. XIII, pg. 205, and for the Sanskrit text, see lines 31–41, pg. 202: atha kharatarapraptāpatapanaśoṣitārātinarēśayaśaḥ palvalaḥ / vimalanijaguṇa-mautikamaṇiśrēṇīsamalaṃkṛtadigaṅganāvalayaḥ / prauḍharipūraḥkapāṭataṭapāṭanaprakaṭitanṛsiṃhaḍaṃbaraḥ / [ś]aṃbaramathanataralataranayanāṃcalacaṃcarīkacuṃbitamukhāṃbujaḥ / svabhujasamupārjitaikāṃgavīrābhi- dhānasakalaguṇanidhānaripudanujavīranārāyaṇanijāyuravadhīritapitāmaharāyapitāmahadvāravatīpura- parivṛḍha-gūrjarakuṃjaradalanakaṃṭhīravaḥ / tēliṃgatuṃgatarūnmūlanadaṃtāvala // mālavapradīpaśamanapralayānilaḥ / dānaguṇā[nvi]takalpamahīruhaḥ / ityādisamastabirudāvalivirājamānē sakalabhūvalayam anuśāsati yadukulakumudacaṃdrē śrīrāmacaṃdranarēṃdrē tathaitatprasādāvāptanikhilarājyadhurīṇatāṃ vahati samastahastipakādhyakṣē nijaguṇasubhagaṃ[bhāvuke / bhāvake] samastakaraṇādhipatyam aṅgīkurvāṇe ca nirjitajhāḍimaṃḍalē maṃtricūḍāmaṇau guṇaratnarōhaṇādrau śrīhemādrau /

of the old Marathi, the grammatical work that this term “bhāvaka” is doing is somewhat 
obscure1158—one possibility being that the term is again being used in the sense of lord of 
literary connoisseurs—what is quite clear is that the old Marathi text has drawn upon a 
preexisting formula for describing Hemādri’s various titles and that the text it is not in fact 
referring to two separate people. The Sanskrit copper plate also makes crystal clear that the 
enormous scope of the authority ascribed to Hemādri—as we shall see, most often by 
himself—“exercising the administration of the whole kingdom,” “controlling the whole 
treasury,” as well as having war elephants at his beck and call, was no fanciful literary trope 
but hard social fact. 
Here we would do well to remember that, among the Seuṇas in particular, the master 
of the elephants held direct control over the most important component of the Yādava war 
machine–its pachyderm shock troops, the nuclear weapons of their day.1159 From the time of 
Bhillama V, this position seems always to have been held by a learned Brāhmaṇa,1160 and its 
conferral seems to have served repeatedly as the fastest track to political advancement, often 
culminating in assuming the highest office in the land, after that of the king himself. In fact, 
except in the case of the apparently preternaturally talented Brāhmaṇa general Kholeśvara, 
1158In the Unkeshwar inscription, one possibility is that bhāvaka almost seems to be serving as a marker of an appositional compound. The alternative, namely, that it means “bringing into being the master of the elephants,” does not make much sense. Another perhaps even stronger reading is that in one or both inscriptions, bhāvaka has a dual intended meaning, and what is being suggested is the technical term of art from Alaṃkāraśāstra, where a bhāvaka is the highest type of literary critic responsible for assessing the worth of poems and plays. As we will see in the next chapter, in the context of our study of the Kaivalyadīpikā, within the domain of aesthetics, the term bhāvaka is first popularized within the Daśarūpaka of Dhanañjaya and its commentary, the Āloka, by Dhanika, two authors Hemādri knows intimately and draws upon extensively. The role of bhāvaka as master aesthete is one we could easily imagine Hemādri enacting, though its exact rhetorical function within the present inscriptions remains less than transparent. 1159For an eye-opening treatment of the elephant in Indian society and its use in warfare, see T. Trautmann, Elephants and Kings: An Environmental History (Chicago, University of Chicago, 2015). 1160On the use of elephants in warfare among the Seuṇas, see Srinivas Ritti, The Seunas: The Yadavas of Devagiri (Dharwad, Karnatak University, 1973). 
1291 
who appears to have used other tactics,1161 it seems that most of the major victories of the 
Yādavas were dependent on the deploying of huge battalions of elephants in the service of 
crushing their enemies. Effectively, so long as the king did not object, the office of master of 
the elephants could decide when, how, and where to wage war, and could also bring the threat 
of physical violence to bear against those who resisted this authority. As the Thane inscription 
tells us, this is precisely what Hemādri seems to have done when he conquered the 
Jhāḍimaṇḍala, a region to the north of Marathwada, the reincorporation of which into the Seuṇa 
domain is never assigned in our inscriptions to king Rāmacandra himself. As we shall see in 
the next chapter, the master of elephants was also entrusted to prosecute the king’s own wars 
and, in the absence of the king himself, to receive the homage of subjugated rulers who the 
Seuṇa forces has defeated on the battlefield. 
As both the Unkeshwar and Thane inscriptions make plain, in the case of Hemādri, 
sovereign “hard power” over the military found its complement in autonomous economic 
power through “managing the entirety of the royal treasury,” and soft power, in his capacity as 
chief minister and policy advisor guiding at least two generations of Seuṇa kings. Perhaps most 
critically, as śrīkaraṇeśvara, Hemādri assumed an active and direct oversight not only over the 
workings of the royal bureaucracy, comprised of scribes, accountants, and record keepers, 
itself, but ultimately, as he would reimagine the role, of the production, evaluation, and 
preservation of documentary record keeping throughout the Seuṇa world. 
As we will soon see, Hemādri was at once a brilliant and original theologian and the 
architect of a new vision for articulating a powerful and pious “Hindu” state. His most 
immediately evident legacy, however, from an Indological perspective, are four surviving 
1161See the introduction to Ajay Mitra Shastri, Yādava Inscriptions from Ambe Jogai (Hoshiarpur: Vishveshvaranand Institute, 1972). 
1292 
Sanskrit treatises, all of which suffer from poor transmission and inadequate editions. We have 
the “Resurrection of the Ayurveda” (Āyurvedarasāyana), his commentary on the 
Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya;1162 the “Discrimination Regarding the Play of Hari” (Harilīlavivekā), his 
commentary on what is essentially a thematic index to key narrative episodes in the Bhāgavata 
Purāṇa;1163 and, the “Illuminator of Enstasy” (Kaivalyadīpikā), which ostensibly comments 
on his disciple Bopadeva’s anthologization of verses, the Muktāphala, from the Bhāgavata 
Purāṇa.1164 And of course, we have the “Wish-Fulfilling Gem of the Four Classes” 
(Caturvargacintāmaṇi), a voluminous Dharmaśāstra nibandha.1165 And yet, without any 
exaggeration, in the entirety of the history of Sanskrit thought, there are few figures whose 
legacy had a greater concrete impact, within the medium of śāstra, in the domain of religion, 
and upon the wider social world.1166 
1162Anna Moresvara Kunte, ed. Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya, 7th ed. (Varanasi: Chowkamba, 1982). 1163This work, parts of which have incorporated in Madhusūdana Sarasvatī’s commentary on the Harilīlā, survives in several manuscripts. On the basis of three copies contained in the Lalchand research library, Kiyokazu Okita has recently correctly identified the Vivekā commentary as a work by Hemādri. Kiyokazu Okita, “The Authorship of the Commentary on Bopadeva’s Harilīlā,” Journal of Indian and Buddhist 68, no. 3 (2020): 1107–1113. I also consulted NPGMP Manuscript No. 4-635, a paper manuscript in an indifferent hand of the seventeenth century, which provides further readings above and beyond the textual parallels identified by Okita confirming this is a work by Hemādri. There is also a single copy printed edition of the Vivekā from the nineteenth century produced in Vrindavan, preserved in the India Office collection at the British Library. 1164The Muktāphala and Kaivalyadīpikā exist in two editions. The first of these, from 1920, as Durga Bhattacharya remarks in his introduction, is so full of textual corruptions as to be virtually unusable, having retained throughout a Bengali confusion of sibilants and semi-vowels, and drawing upon manuscript evidence that transmits gibberish for pages at a time. The present work draws upon the second edition. D. M. Bhattacharya, ed., Muktāphala of Vopadeva with Kaivalyadīpikā of Hemādri (Calcutta: J.C. Sarkhel, 1944). 1165As will be discussed below, the Caturvargacintāmaṇi has never in fact been printed in a complete form based on the surviving manuscript evidence, which is itself likely incomplete. The most complete vulgate edition of the text, which has been reprinted, often in partial form, a number of times subsequently omitting sections of the Śrāddhakalpa, remains the edition printed in the Bibliotheca Indica as volume 72. Bharatacandra Siromani, ed., Chaturvarga Chintamani, 4 vols. (Calcutta: Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1873–1911). A separate edition of the first volume of the Śrāddhakalpa, making use of entirely different manuscript material, has also been published. Vishwanath Shastri Bharadwaj, ed., Caturvargacintāmaniḥ (New Delhi: Siksavibhaga, Bharata Sarakara, 1971). 1166It is an understatement to say that Hemādri has been ill-served by both Western and Indian secondary literature, within which his work is almost exclusively discussed either in the service of mining his Purāṇic citations or with the intention of using the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s rājapraśasti (not included in our editions but printed separately by Bhandarkar) in the service of triangulating dynastic histories in the early medieval Deccan. The only full- length study dedicated to Hemādri in any language is Kesava Appa Padhye, Hemādri urpha Hemādpanta yāñce Caritra, composed in 1931. Though a work of considerable erudition, for unlike everyone else he has clearly read 
1293 
Hemādri’s work at length and with care, it is afflicted by what to the modern Western reader seems an almost unimaginable credulousness on the part of its author. The opening sentence should be enough to give the interested reader a taste of what is at hand:“hemādripaṇḍitāsārakhā vidvān, vibhavaśālī, kīrttimān, dānaśūra, rājyakāryadharaṃdhara, sadācāranī va dharmābhimānī asā dusarā puruṣa pūrvīcyā kālāṃta jhālā nāhīṃ va puḍheṃ hoṇāra nāhī,” (bhāga pahilā, page 1). Succinctly, Padhye takes at face value everything ever said by or about Hemādri in sources ancient and modern. He also assigns to our subject a host of works that are clearly by other authors, resulting in a composite picture of Hemādri as an intellectual. More constructively, Padhye is privy to oral traditions concerning Hemādri that are apparently now lost, including a memory among certain artisan communities of a Hemādrīya śilpaśāstra tradition, for which we will find partial confirmation later on in the present chapter. He has also drawn upon a number of Mahānubhāvika sources, published and unpublished, both contemporary to the Seuṇa Yādavas and from subsequent centuries, that offer representations, of varying reliability, of the Seuṇa court and Hemādri’s role within it. 
Sadly, the remainder of our literature discussing Hemādri simply treats our author as an embodied instantiation of a perennial Brāhmaṇical worldview, often in a manner that directly conflicts with the theology in the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, without consulting his Sanskrit works. Emblematic of this trend is the usually exemplary G. Sontheimer, author of what was until recently the most substantial essay on Hemādri, who relies exclusively on the old Marathi sources of the Mahānubhavikas in representing his subject. Günther-Dietz Sontheimer, “God, Dharma and Society in the Yadava Kingdom of Devagiri According to the Lilacharitra of Chakradhara.” In Günther-Dietz Sontheimer: Essays on Religion, Literature, and Law, ed. Heidrum Brückner, et. al., (New Delhi: Manohar, 2004 [1982]), 305–326. Sontheimer’s model has been much expanded upon and refined to good effect in regard to the old Marathi sources in Christian Novetzke’s The Quotidian Revolution as well as in an additional essay composed for the Oxford History of Hinduism’s volume on Hindu law. Both of these works offer us vivid portraits of Hemādri as perceived by the Mahānubhāvika communities he persecuted. Novetzke, however, not being a Sanskritist, relies on Sontheimer’s characterization of Hemādri’s intellectual project, which alas is entirely uninformed by a study of his texts. Christian Lee Novetzke, The Quotidian Revolution: Vernacularization, Religion, and the Premodern Public Sphere in India (New York: Columbia University Press, 2016); Christian Lee Novetzke, “Vernacularization,” in The Oxford History of Hinduism: Hindu Law: A New History of Dharmaśāstra, ed. Donald R. Davis (New York: Oxford University Press, 2017), 480–96. 
A similar issue is in evidence in Mary McGee’s monumental dissertation comparing the representation of vrata practice in the nibandha literature, especially vis-à-vis the role of women, with the author’s extensive fieldwork among Maharashtrian women performing vratas. McGee is the only author to date who has studied and translated extensive selections from the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, treating whole vrata cycles. However, her representation of the “nibandhakāra” theology of vrata, against which she contrasts the lived tradition, rests upon a synthetic composite “nibandha theology” that is produced out of an aggregate of her sources without attending to the specific theological positions and procedures of the individual works. In the case of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, in the absence of reading the opening portions of the Vratakhaṇḍa or its Paribhāṣā, she ascribes a theology of vrata to Hemādri that is in many regards antithetical to the one propounded in his text, which we will explore in the next chapter. Mary McGee, Feasting and Fasting: The Vrata Tradition and Its Significance for Hindu Women: A Thesis (PhD diss., Harvard Divinity School, 1987). 
Recent careful textual work, though restricted to the Dānakhaṇḍa of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, has been carried out by David Brick in the context of producing his edition of the Dānakāṇḍa of Lakṣmīdhara. Building upon earlier efforts, such as those of Trautmann, Florinda De Simini has added to our understanding by mapping out the subsequent reception of the text. David Brick, ed. and trans., Brahmanical Theories of the Gift: A Critical Edition and Annotated Translation of the Dānakāṇḍa of the Kṛtyakalpataru (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Oriental Series, 2015); Thomas R. Trautmann, “The gift in India,” HAU: Journal of Ethnographic Theory 7, no. 2 (2017): 485–496; Florinda De Simini, Of Gods and Books: Ritual and Knowledge Transmission in the Manuscript Cultures of Premodern India (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2016). Brick’s work builds upon the pioneering efforts of Aiyangar Rangaswami, the Kṛtyakalpataru’s original editor, each volume of whose work meticulously documents the textual parallels between Lakṣmīdhara’s and Hemādri’s writings. Though its treatment of Hemādri in its first volume is disappointingly terse, P. V. Kane’s History of Dharmaśāstra incorporates references throughout, cross referencing Hemādri’s Caturvargacintāmaṇi within nearly every topic. P. V. Kane, History of Dharmaśāstra, 8 vols. (Pune: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1930–1962). Though it does not focus on the 
1294 
As this chapter will make plain, the Caturvargacintāmaṇi reinvented fundamentally 
and irrevocably the discipline of Dharmaśāstra and the role of the Dharmaśāstrin. Under his 
direction, this knowledge, and as well as its practitioners, who had typically held the religion 
of ordinary people at best in thinly veiled contempt, is refashioned such that they become 
conceptually central to the lived practice of Indian religions. Through his intervention in the 
domain of śāstra, Hemādri takes up arcane hermeneutical strategies from the domain of Pūrva 
Mīmāṃsā and the emergent tradition of the new logic, and for first time in the history of Indic 
thought deploys them in the service of offering a robust intellectual defense of the 
commonsense conclusions of every day Indian religions and its transactional economies of 
spirit-based favors. In doing so, the Wish- Fulfilling Gem of the Four Classes effectively made 
possible much of what is most familiar to us in early modern and modern Smārta Brāhmaṇical 
Hinduism. 
As we will explore in the final chapter, working in a very different register, with the 
Muktāphala and the Kaivalyadīpikā, Hemādri articulates for the first time, seemingly ex nihilo, 
the affective aestheticized devotional theology of the Vaiṣṇava rasika. As a wealth of scholarly 
literature,1167 largely oblivious to the source of this discourse, has demonstrated, these values 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi, touching upon it only briefly, De Simini has also offered our first substantive study on the technique of the dharmanibandhakāras. Florinda De Simini, “Observations on the Use of Quotations in Sanskrit Dharmanibandhas,” Journal of Indian Philosophy 43, no. 4–5 (2015): 601–624. 
In terms of the use of Hemādri’s work as a repository for Purāṇic citations, apart from the collected works of P. K. Gode, as examples of the practice one might fruitfully consults: Albert Henry Allen, “The Vaṭa-Sāvitrī-Vrata, According to Hemādri and the Vratārka,” Journal of the American Oriental Society 21 (1900): 53–66. Rajendra Chandra Hazra, Studies in the Purāṇic Records on Hindu Rites and Customs (Dehli: Motilal Banarsidass, 1987). Discussions of the secondary literature on Hemādri’s in relation to Muktāphala will be reserved for the next chapter. 1167As the literature is quite extensive and well discussed elsewhere, what follows is a selective introduction to representative works in the discourses on bhakti rasa concerning largely Sanskritic Gauḍīya traditions on the one hand and the vernacular deployments of bhakti rasa in Braj Bhasa and various registers of Rajasthani. Among this vast and varied corpus, only a handful of works reflect explicitly on the indebtedness of the largely north Indian Vaiṣṇava rasa traditions to Hemādri and Bopadeva’s intellectual project. Among traditional authorities, it is only Jīvagosvāmin in his Ṣaṭsandarbha who acknowledges his debt to his predecessors, especially in the 
1295 
and conceptual frameworks come to define a plurality of early modern Vaiṣṇava devotional 
traditions, especially those found in north and central India and Bengal. Concurrent to his 
Ālaṃkārika-inspired interpretive project, which will set the program for much of the 
theological writings of the Gauḍīya Gosvāmīs, though this influence remains even less 
recognized, Hemādri’s bhakti writings also present us with the earliest instance of scholastic 
reflection in the tradition of theistic Advaita Vedānta philosophy, prefiguring much of what 
has been assumed to be revolutionary within the writings of figures like Madhusūdana 
Sarasvatī. The grand irony, of course, is that in their early modern reception, what were 
originally two facets of a single interpretive project—affective devotionalism and theistic 
nondual Vedānta—would come to be seen as distinct and opposing schools of thought. 
Despite the undeniable significance of these learned contributions, comprising a 
neglected legacy that will receive ample attention by the final chapter’s closure, the present 
chapter anchors its inquiry not in reflection upon how Hemādri the brilliant scholar sets the 
agenda for the coming centuries, but rather on how Hemādri the strategist and effective 
Tattvasandarbha, where he cites the Muktāphala by name several times. Even here, his dependence on Hemādri’s arguments and rhetoric, which is far more extensive than he acknowledges, is heavily occluded. Secondary literature that reflects on this dynamic includes: Stuart Mark Elkman, Jīva Gosvāmin's Tattvasandarbha: A Study on the Philosophical and Sectarian Development of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Movement (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1986); Ravi M. Gupta, The Caitanya Vaiṣṇava Vedānta of Jīva Gosvāmī: When Knowledge Meets Devotion (London: Taylor & Francis, 2007).

1296 
administrator brings closure to the ethos of the past. Despite his lofty position and self- 
identification with a Brāhmaṇical ethos, Hemādri does not envision spearheading a 
conservative restoration of the storied ideals of some imagined Brāhmaṇical golden age that 
has run afoul of the degeneracies of the kali yuga. Instead, rather candidly, he offers to his 
readers what amounts to a genuinely revolutionary program for social and religious change. 
With a degree of self-awareness—effectively otherwise unknown to the world of śāstra—that 
what he has to offer is radical and unprecedented, through his writings, Hemādri aims to 
establish new norms appropriate for a brave new world. Through the state and its bureaucracy, 
he makes those norms actionable. It is in this spirit that he writes in the introduction to the final 
book of the Caturvargacintamāṇi, the definitive deliberation concerning ritual timing 
(kālanirṇaya): 
Of him [king Mahādeva], the Lord of all the śrīkaraṇas (sarvaśrīkaraṇaprabhuḥ) has the name Hemādri. Because of his munificence above all others, he [Hemādri] was capable of producing all forms of auspiciousness/wealth for everyone (sarvaśrīkaraṇaprabhuḥ). . . . 
On the part of that lord of śrīkaraṇas, there was a certain cleverness when it came to writing. By him, the walls of the directions were quickly imprinted with the praises (praśasti) of [his] glory. 
With his power, having wiped clean the flawed script has been written by the creator on the foreheads of the people, he [Hemādri] now pens this auspicious [script], and the creator/fate wondrously makes it authoritative (pramāṇīkurute). . . . 
I imagine the ocean/treasury is becoming as if it is full of waves—with the water that is the charity he has given. Even at the end of the eon, he does not put things out of balance due to [the bends of the serpent Śeṣa/ the flaws that are the remainder (śeṣa) in the balance book]. And so, having discerned the security/surety of the state of the ocean, may [Nārāyaṇa], the enemy of the Daityas, sleep peacefully on the bed that is the body of the bull among serpents [Śeṣa]. 
What can we say of that marvel that is the substance of the deluge of rainwater that is his charity? In contrast to [such charity], the fame of the munificence of others takes on the value of a clod of grass. 
1297Fallen on the ground, that [rain of charity] erases the mud [on the feet] of the people who absorb it. When it is set down in the hands of the petitioners, it erases the evil script [fate] inscribed on the plank that is the forehead. . . . 
Though he bears the guise of a twice-born, Hemādri alone is recognized as the “mountain of gold” (Hemādri). [As he is] possessed of a continuum of nobility, they say that his right arm is the wish-fulfilling tree. 
Having seen that the three worlds were impoverished in stories of dharma due to the power of the kali yuga, to offer assistance to them out of compassion, he gracefully manifested the Cintāmaṇi. 
Having uttered its four divisions, known by name as Vrata, Dāna, Tīrtha and Mokṣa, for the purpose of describing matters that supplement that, he composes the remainder (Pariśeṣa) division.1168 
Beneath its wit and mythological allusions, this is poetry about bureaucratic 
administration, about providing social services, about banking, and most of all, about centrally 
directed social reforms. Hemādri—a name that quite literally means “the mountain of gold,” 
provides the people—especially ascetics and Brāhmaṇas—with an unceasing flow of 
philanthropy. At the same time, so that god and king alike can sleep easefully knowing their 
kingdom’s safety and success is secured, he ensures the financial security and social stability 
of the realm. In the effective absence of the slumbering king, his minister inscribes throughout 
the realm formalized proclamations (praśasti) praising his own glory. It is not the inactive and

distant king, but the engaged minister, who can and has accomplished what more distant 
powers did not dare. 
Hemādri rejects the fatalistic pan-Indo-European notion that each individual person’s 
destiny, long before they were born, was secretly inscribed upon their forehead by the creator 
deity at the moment of their conception. Breaking from the inherited weight of tradition and 
the claims it lays upon the individual, which he sees as fallible and constricting, our author 
asserts that he has drafted for humankind a new and better future. He has changed the rules of 
the game that everyone thought immutable, and so Brahmā must resign himself to making 
authoritative (pramāṇīkurute) —quite literally, to establishing new pramāṇas, whole new sets 
of world-ordering ordinances. In the manner of charismatic leaders everywhere, Hemādri 
claims that he has ushered in an era of unparalleled fortune and riches. But whereas, especially 
in early medieval or even early modern South Asia, we would expect such promises to be 
founded upon appeal to a higher authority, be it special messages from the gods, an esoteric 
transmission from a lineage, or declarations of one’s own divinity, instead, in an almost 
relentlessly “secular” manner, Hemādri grounds his righteous vision in the power of his office. 
As we have already begun to see, our polymath was effectively the acting ruler under 
several Yādava kings in succession. In this capacity he was awarded a myriad of titles and a 
wide range of responsibilities. And yet, time and again in his writings, his rhetoric exalts above 
everything else what is at first glance a rather unassuming position, the office of 
sarvaśrīkaraṇaprabhuḥ or śrīkaraṇeśvara. The title quite literally means, “lord of all the 
scribal bureaucrats.” On the surface, this seems to speak to a rather restricted scope of 
influence. On this basis, the very little that has been written about Hemādri in the past has 
assumed that whatever his gifts as an intellectual, he was minor functionary. What such 
1299 
analysis misses is that, as we shall see, while the comprehensive and felicitous use Hemādri 
would make of this office seems to be sui generis, though it was unknown to the Kalyāṇi 
Cāḷukyas and their allies, elevation of the śrīkaraṇeśvara to the center of government is not 
without precedent. Thus, for example in the Lekhapaddhati, a promissory note from 1267 CE 
bearing the seal of the kings of Valabhi, travelling as a sample document alongside a scribal 
template, provides us with confirmation that by the middle of the thirteenth century, the 
previously distinct roles of chief minister of the king (mahāmātya) and lord of scribes 
(śrīkaraṇeśvara) had, as a matter of course, become conflated. 
Vyavahārapatra from the reign of Śrī Saraṅgadeva:

As a range of epigraphical evidence beginning in the late twelfth century from southern 
Gujarat and southern Maharashtra attests, this new office of śrīkaraṇeśvara (lord of the 
śrīkaraṇas) married the administrative, sacerdotal and apotropaic functions of the king’s chief 
councilor and master of mantras with command over a bureaucratic apparatus possessing the 
type of intimate local knowledge necessary for ensuring the extraction of revenue and the 
management of debts. Succinctly, were he to choose to make use of it, a śrīkaraṇeśvara had

both the influence and means for concretely reshaping South Asia’s cultural and religious 
landscape. As we saw in chapter two, śrīkaraṇas, called senobova in old Kannada, are a class, not 
a caste, of professional scribes, responsible for the composition and production of the 
ephemeral paperwork required of every institution if it wished to be legally legible. If the 
world, as Skandasvāmin had said, “runs on a never-ending transactionality,” the role with 
which the śrīkaraṇa was entrusted was at once to document those transactions and to formalize 
them into a standardized shape. Whether we are talking about personal correspondence, 
testimony in court, proclamations, contracts, minutes for a meeting, financial records, ledgers 
of debt and expenditure, or the text of an inscription, the task of the śrīkaraṇa is to rationalize 
the error-ridden messiness of lived human experience. If we treat the discussions in 
Dharmaśāstra as documentary as opposed to aspirational, regardless of its values and 
normativities, any political power or social body that wanted to ensure that, in case of conflict 
between communities or within the community, its rights could be adjudicated, would 
necessarily have had such people on staff producing meticulous records. In a world order 
defined by juridical and epistemic diversity, the office and praxis of the śrīkaraṇa represented 
a rare instance of a universal institution operating within a shared framework. 
Up until the end of the twelfth century, neither our literary nor our documentary 
sources offer any suggestions of the scribe as anything other than an independent agent 
beholden to his specific community or teacher. In the middle of the thirteenth century, most 
pointedly under the Seuṇa Yādavas, however, what seems to happen is something with no prior 
precedent—the emergence of a brotherhood of scribes distributed throughout the pluralistically 
ordered world, but all answering to a centralized state. In other words, a bureaucratic apparatus 
1301 
possessing intimate local knowledge, transcripts of every meeting, everyone’s genealogies, if 
they were invested in a hall of records, all the police records, all the contracts, as well as the 
ledgers that enabled the extraction of revenue and the management of debts were suddenly no 
longer beholden to the institutions of which they were a part. Instead, it seems their records, in 
theory, fell under the jurisdiction of the state, or more properly, under its śrīkaraṇeśvara and 
his acting officers. Beyond any ambiguity, we can situate Hemādri in this position by 1260 
CE, when King Mahādeva effectively assumes the throne, but there is also some rather 
suggestive indications in the inscriptional record that Hemādri had already risen rather high 
within the ranks of the institution of managing the śrīkaraṇas as early as 1254 CE, when he 
first appears in our inscriptional record, already composing inscriptions. 
If one had to identify a year and say “this is when the Śaiva age ended,” a particularly 
strong case could be made for 1246 CE, for this is when the great warrior, statesman, and Śākta 
initiate Siṅghaṇa II dies after reigning for nearly half a century. He is replaced on the throne 
by his son Kānharadeva, who would rule for a bit more than a decade (c. 1245/1247– 
1258/1260, depending on your sources). In our documentary records—all at once—everything 
changes.1170 With the singular exception of Siṅghaṇa II’s own guru, Sarveśvara, whose estate 
at Munavalli is supported into his dotage, the Seuṇa Yādavas cease to patronize the 
Kālamukhas. 
1170A major shortcoming of the present study, unavoidable under the current world circumstances, is that it does not contain an excavation of the specific lineage of Kālamukhas, distantly related to the Balligave Śaktipariṣad, that, at least from the time of Bhillama V, had a special relationship with the Seuṇa royal family. Prior to the lineage’s relocation of their ritual center to the Seuṇa constructed city of Munavalli in the greater Dharwad region, the center of this particular community of Kālamukhas from the time of the Rāṣṭrakūṭas was in the greater Bijapur region. Key sites I have yet to document include Sāloṭagi, Tamba, Goṭṭagaḍi, and Kuppaṭūr. We also know of branch maṭhas at Nēsarige, Gōkāge (modern Gokak), Koṭṭumbage, and Goḷiyahaḷḷi. Many of these places seem to preserve relevant material culture. There is also a large corpus of multilingual inscriptions (many unpublished) that need careful study.

Except for a few sites with close ties to the court—most notably Ellora and 
Pandharpur— the Seuṇa Yādavas largely give up on issuing traditional undying land grants. 
In fact, there is also an almost total disappearances of instances in which the king or his 
representatives formally renew or acknowledge the existence of such institutions. Instead, as 
early as 1249, the formalized washing of the feet of a sacerdotal authority and 
acknowledgement of his and his community’s autonomy is replaced by new approach, which 
we see illustrated in an edict issued by an officer named Kanaya of behalf of the emperor 
Kānharadeva, in which “the worshipper of the sovereign’s feet, entrusted with the collection 
of taxes in the districts of Kolhapur and the whole of the king’s domain,” grants to some 
Brāhmaṇas in a village limited rights of use over land to be accompanied by regular taxation. 
From 1248 onward, often by force, the sovereignty of differentiated spaces, even those of great 
1305 
antiquity, is revoked. Their territory and revenue production capacity is integrated into the 
apparatus of the state. The management of these now circumscribed land grants is almost 
invariably placed into new hands. 
In the majority of cases, the new custodians, whether we are talking about temples or 
villages, are Brāhmaṇas who are represented through a rhetoric that extols quite specifically 
not just their lineage but their knowledge and active practice of Vedic ritual as well as their 
mastery of Vedānta. While Brāhmaṇas who seem to identify as Śaiva continue to form a 
substantial demographic, we also suddenly see the emergence of a range of types of Vaiṣṇava 
communities, now entirely independent from a central focus on the worship of Narasiṃha. In 
particular, there is sudden proliferation of temples dedicated to Gopāla or Kṛṣṇa as well as the 
installation of images of Kṛṣṇa into previously Śaiva ritual center centers. Beginning from 
1248, where a gāvuṇḍa named Kaluvar Singa in Hebbali, Karnataka makes a donation in 
support of the “vārī” on behalf of Viṭṭhal of Pandharpur,1171 we also see our first indications 
of popular Marathi devotional religion emerging on the local level. 
1171Unmentioned by any of our secondary literature, Y. Raikar (1964) directs our attention to the following inscription, which was apparently published in the Marathi periodical Sadhana in 1956, no. 270: “Sadhana.25-8- 1956 Kannada.” A.D.1243. A Kannada stone, inscription found at Hebbali near Dharwar of Krishnadeva’s reign. Refers to one Kaluvar Simgagavunda who donated towards the ‘vāri’ of Vitthal. It proves the antiquity of Varakari cult.” I have yet to have been able to access this periodical which is absent from WorldCat. 
1306 
The case of the Purasiddhēśvara temple at Haveri, a famous Śaiva ritual center south 
of Dharwad, though in some ways slightly eccentric, offers us a rather elegant illustration of 
many of these dynamics presented in rapid succession.1172 With our earliest, though decidedly 
unhelpful, inscription dating back to the time of the Rāṣṭrakūṭas, in something like its present 
form the temple seems to have been established under Vikramāditya VI’s father Āvahamalla 
(1042–68 CE), though the agrahāra itself is plausibly of much greater antiquity, and we have 
records relating to the Cāḷukyas, Kalachuri, Hoysalas, and Seuṇa Yādavas. More specifically, 
we have a number of inscriptions issued during the reign of the Seuṇa Yādava King 
Siṅghaṇadeva II by a range of different types of social actors, one from 1227, two from 1228, 
and one from 1230 CE. Sadly, and this seems to be true for the whole corpus, each of these has 
1172 The Haveri inscriptions are scattered across a range of volumes, especially in Epigraphia Carnatica and South Indian Inscriptions. Here we draw especially on South Indian Inscriptions, Volume XVIII, which includes the long Seuṇa inscription 242, essential portions of which will be translated below. N. Laksminarayan Rao, ed., South Indian Inscriptions, Volume XVIII: Bombay-Karnatak Inscriptions Vol. III (With Introductory Notes in English (New Delhi: Archaeological Survey of India, 1975). 
1307sustained damage in various places such that in one instance the donor’s name is illegible. That 
being said, in the time of Siṅghanadeva, in the cases where the donor is known—in one 
instance this is Jāyidevanāyaka, in one is it is the Mahāmaṃḍaḷēsvara Lakṣmīpāḷadēva, and in 
another it is some merchants, Decceseṭṭi and Māyiseṭṭi, acting with the permission of 
Lakṣmīpāḷadēva—when the relevant portion of the inscription is preserved, the figures in

the recipient—again in three cases—the chief benefactory acting on behalf of the god 
Siddhēśvara is a Śaiva ācārya. Depending on the nature of his relationship with the donors, 
this figure is referred to in slightly different terms. Thus, while he is called by the merchants,

but clearly less intimately connected patron he is simply “the recipient of the donation being 
the main figure Jñānarāśidēvara (jñānarāsidēvaru mukhyavāgi pātra),” and from the 
perspective of the powerful Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Lakṣmīpāḷadēva, he is simply to be addressed 
by name along with the council of ruling authorities whose social origin is here unmarked 
(jñānarāsidēvaruṃ mahājanaṃgaḷu). For our purposes what is most important is that this 
demonstrates that during the reign of Siṅghaṇadeva II, independent of personal affiliation, 
donors and most likely visitors to Haveri, whether they were making offerings to the main 
deity Siddhanātha or to secondary figure like Gaṇeśa, would have addressed themselves to the 
resident Śaiva authority and only secondarily to a village council of indeterminate social 
composition. 
The contrast between this corpus of documents and the two inscriptions at Haveri 
issued in the reign of Kānharadeva are stark indeed. In what seems to be the earlier of the texts 
(though how early is uncertain as the date is illegible), the Yādava king sends his Daṇḍanāyaka, 
described as the “worshipper at the feet of the venerable Kandhara Deva, twice-borns, and 
gurus, and the subduer of enemy armies,” Cauṇḍa/Camuṇḍarāya, not to make a donation but 
to ensure the proper administration of the grant. Cauṇḍa we learn, had been ruling (rājyaṃ 
geyyuttamirě) on behalf of the king from “his palace at Puligere,” which is to say, he had taken 
over as his own property the decidedly Śākta-Śaiva undying land-grant at Lakṣmēśvara, with 
its open links to Somanātha and the Kāpālikas. As the inscription all but concludes, for we are 
dealing afterwards with a very damaged text, after honoring the controlling authority with the 
customary water offering—noticeably, nobody washes anybody’s feet—Cauṇḍa discusses the 
nature of the community that will manage the grant: 
The greatness of the Four Hundred (nānūrvvara), for whom the customary water libation was performed (dhārāpūrvvakam māḍida), is as follows: 
1309 
[S.] The dwelling place of Brahmā/Brāhmaṇas is the abode of the Vedas without remainder. It is encircled by the bearers of wisdom. It is the great oranament to the circle of the earth belonging to the twice-borns who are kings of Nalapurī. The circle of the uplifting assembly (sabhā) is worthy of praise every day and every moment by those asking questions and the learned epistemologists intent upon its renowned inspiration. 
The Four Hundred are devoted to the yamas and niyamas, recitation of sacred texts, mantra repetition, oblations, meditation, conduct, and virtues (svasti yamaniyamasvādhyāyajapahomasamādhiśīlaguṇanirataruṃ); their actions are always benevolent for everyone; their minds are restrained by knowledge of the self through reflection (manana) and meditation (nididhyāsana) on the Vedas, Upaniṣads, Smṛtis, and Purāṇas; . . . . their pastime is the consideration of the composition of Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā śāstra, and they amuse themselves with their mistress, the Goddess of Speech. 
It was based on these conditions that, in accordance with prior custom (pūrvvamāryyāděyiṃd(a)), while the Hoysala king Ballāḷa managed (naḍasu/naḍayisu) the agrahāra, it was handed down within the lineage (paraṃparāgatam) on the basis of the Four Hundred’s (nānūrvvara) fitness (yogyatābaladiṃ) and their capacity to curse and bless (śāpa-anugraha-samārtthateyiṃ). 
Now, [Camuṇḍarāya] became intent (udyatan ādan) upon making (māḍal) dharma strong again (punar ūrjjitam), for it had disappeared [since the time of the Hoysala king Ballāḷa) because of the deeds of evil men (duṣṭakaṣṭara děsěyiṃda).1174 
The most obvious difference between this inscription’s depiction of Haveri as it was 
administered in the time of Kandharāya and the previous corpus we have just explored is the 
complete absence of Jñānarāśi and the forces he represents. Apart from the usual frozen poetic

tropes tying mythological allusions to the power and magnanimity of the class of officer 
warlords, our inscription has also become denuded of any specifically Śaiva references or 
theology. Somewhat less obviously but of equal significance, all of the technical language 
affirming Haveri’s status as a tax-exempt land grant that is the perpetual property of a specific 
managerial class has also vanished. As we can see, just as has happened to Jñānarāśi and his 
cronies, markedly Śaiva social actors and their systems of value have been entirely elided. 
They have been replaced with a sociality and semiotics that is resolutely, and self-consciously, 
not merely Brāhmaṇical, but hypertropically evocative of what we would think of as Sanskritic 
“orthodoxy.” While the so-called “Four Hundred” have incorporated into their 
accomplishments a modified canon of the usual Śaiva/Kālamukha occupations, these are 
completely overshadowed by emphatic claims that their conduct does nothing that hurts other 
people (sarvvajanaparōpakāracaritaruṃ), that they practice Vedāntic modes of inquiry and 
“meditation” that takes as its focus the Smṛtis and Purāṇas as well as the Vedic sources 
themselves (vēdavedāntasmṛtipurāṇamanananididhyāsanātmajñāna-niyatacittaruṃ), and that 
they preside over what is at once a renowned juridical and scholastic council (sabhā), 
answering petitions nearly in the very same breath that they compose works on Nyāya and 
Mīmāṃsā. In short, what we are seeing at play here is a discursive dynamic that explicitly 
fuses together disciplinary power and the monitoring of decorum with the production and 
discussion of śāstric knowledge. As we shall soon discover, despite its marginality in the 
classical world of śāstra as a model for what it means to be Brāhmaṇa, it is precisely this 
imaginary linking of śāstra, especially Vedānta as theology, with Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā serving 
as its disciplinary handmaidens, so different from that of the prior generations, that comes to 
1311 
dominate the vision of knowledge production in and around the Seuṇa Yādava court from the 
reign of Kandharāya to the demise of the dynasty. 
Kandharāya’s officer Cauṇḍa treats his intervention as a simple restoration of the 
property to its original owners, the upstanding and properly Brāhmaṇical “Four Hundred.” 
Quite pointedly, Cauṇḍa juxtaposes the proper administration of the land-grant according to 
prior convention as occurring in an unbroken fashion: “while the Hoysala king Ballāḷa 
managed the agrahāra, it was handed down within the lineage,” and that the dharma had only 
disappeared in the short interim between the end Ballāḷa’s time and the present “because of the 
deeds of evil men (duṣṭakaṣṭara děsěyiṃda).” The subtext here is quite fascinating and 
unexpected. The good custodian, the Hoysala king Vīra Ballāḷa II (c. 1173–1220 CE) was the 
chief rival and enemy of the Seuṇa Yādava kings in their ongoing struggles to maintain and 
expand influence in the Kuntaladēśa. In contrast, the period during which dharma is said to 
have declined— in other words, when Jñānarāśi was active at Haveri—exclusively falls during 
the decades when Kandharāya’s father Siṅghaṇa II and his officers largely controlled this 
region of the Kuntaladēśa and patronized Haveri. 
It is here that our story starts to get complicated in a manner that makes very apparent 
the plasticity of identities over a couple of centuries, even among a group of people who bear 
some of the same names and signifiers. On the surface, Cauṇḍa’s representation of Jñānarāśi 
as a temporary interloper who displaced the long-standing claim of the Brāhmaṇical “Four 
Hundred,” whose property was originally bestowed upon them by the mythical hero Nala, 
looks plausible. Now it is true that the technical term for the Brāhmaṇical Four Hundred, 
“nānūrvvaru,” does not appear in the short inscriptions from the time of Kandharāya’s father, 
though one of them, the most official, does refer briefly but respectively to the mahājanaṃgaḷu, 
1312 
and these could potentially be the same people. As we shall soon see, it is also the case that as 
befitting Nalapuri’s reputation as a center for scholasticism and learning, the nānūrvvaru have 
a long history of being represented through a certain kind of hyper-Brāhmaṇical rhetoric. 
Alongside such core continuities, however, as one goes back, what it meant for the Four 
Hundred to be “Brāhmaṇical” undergoes substantive shifts. 
In the only record1175 to survive from the time of the “good” Hoysala king Vīra Ballāḷa 
II, we learn that his main minister went to Nalapuri to help oversee a major renovation and 
refurbishment of the temple of Siddhanātha. Assisting him in these efforts were some sěṭṭis, 
very much like the ones who appear in Siṅghaṇadeva’s inscriptions, as well as the Brāhmaṇical 
Four Hundred “nānūrvvaru,” all of whom are now described as bhaktas (samasta bhaktaruvaṃ 
nānūrvvaruvaṃ) as well as the leader of the village Śri Śrī Śrī Hěggaḍě Vaijayyanu, a figure 
whose exact identity is uncertain, but who seems to occupying the same space later assumed 
by Jñānarāśi, right down to his intimate relationship with the merchants. The grant, needless 
to say, is to be protected forever (ācandrārkkatāraṃbaraṃ rakṣisuvaru). 
After the single Hoysala grant, we have a single inscription1176 issued under the 
Kalachuris. In this document, an officer named Keśirāja and his Daṇḍanāyaka Basava

kēśirājananvayam ěntěṃdaḍě) both of them acting in the service of King Bijjala, make 
offerings to the deities Siddhēśvara and Indrēśvara (siddhēśvaradēvarggě 
iṃdrēśvaradēvarggě). Given that, as we shall soon see, despite all its hyper-Brāhmaṇical 
rhetorical trappings, the material culture at Haveri offer us some of the earliest demonstrable 
instances of iṣṭaliṅga worship in the visual record, it is worth noting in passing that these two 
officers bear the same titles and names of famous Vīraśaiva śaraṇas and are acting on behalf 
of the very same King Bijjala who features in the Vīraśaiva hagiographical tradition. In any 
case, these two officers of the Kalachuri king are received by the Brāhmaṇical Four Hundred, 
but also by a village leader from the line of Rudradēva (hěggaḍě rudradēvananvayamaṃ), 
possibly a fellow referred to as the Brahmabhaṭṭāraka of Māṇikamaṭha, who rather surprisingly 
greets them by subordinating himself to their authority (pādapadmōjīviyěnisida). Nalapuri, 
according to this record, was founded by the mythical king Naḷa who in ancient times assigned 
Rudradēva as the village’s leading authority (astu naḷacakravartti māḍida hiriya hĕṟiḍĕ 
hěggaḍě rudradēvapramukha). Though the record is here broken in a manner that does not 
permit us to figure out which attributes are just being assigned to Rudradēva and successors 
and which belong to the Brāhmaṇical Four Hundred, one or both of them are seen as singularly 
intent upon Śiva’s state (śivapadaika) at the same time they are “devoted to the yamas and 
niyamas, recitation of sacred texts, teaching of sacred texts, focused visualizations, vows of

silence, mantra repetition, samādhi, and conduct (svasti 
yamaniyamasvādhyāyadhyānadhāraṇamōnānuṣṭhānajapasamādhiśīlasaṃpannaruṃ) as well 
as Vedic ritual and sacrifice, recitation and instruction in Vedic texts 
(yujanayājanādhyayanādhyāpana). 
Curiously, in a display of both ascetic virtues and śāstric knowledge, we are told they 
are attached to being recipients of a panoply of very specific forms of philanthropy, mostly 
stemming from the canonical list found in the Matsya Purāṇa, namely, gifts of cloth, gifts of 
girls, gifts of female water buffalo, gifts of black antelope skin, the hiraṇyagarbha offering, 
and the tulāpuruṣa offering (kanyādāna-vastradānatsyatradāna-mahiśīdāna- 
kṛṣṇājinahiraṇyagarbha-tulāpuraśādyanēkadānapratigrahanirataru). Here again, the stone is 
damaged, but as many of these titles will resurface, it is worth noting that the text now 
celebrates their performances of a range of Vedic sacrifices, (the vājapēya, agniṣṭoma, 
aśvamēdha) as well as their virtuous worship of guru and Brāhmaṇas (dvijagurupūjātatpara), 
their purified bodies (pavitrīkṛtaśarīraru), and their mastery of two bodies of knowledge, 
namely, śāstra (Buddhist philosophy, Mīmāṃsā, Vaiśeṣika, logic, grammar, Vedānta, the 
meaning of the Veda and its aṅgas, metrics, poetics, poetry and drama) as well as an 
underspecified but decidedly Tantric esoterica (yogamaṃtrataṃtrayaṃtra). In other words, we 
are at one of the most Brāhmaṇical places in the Kuntaladēśa that is not purely a Brāhmaṇa 
agrahāra solely dedicated Vedic ritual, and yet what “Brāhmaṇical knowledge” looks like, 
even in the hands of practicing Vaidika ritualists, is a thoroughgoing fusion of śāstra with the 
Mantramārga. If a person were to trace this story back even further into the properly Kalyāṇi 
Cāḷukyan records, a task that will not detain us here, as we approach the time when the temple 
of Purasiddhēśvara was built, not all that much changes. The nānūrvvaru, those best of 
1316 
Brāhmaṇas (dvijottama) are assigned ever longer and more elaborate canons of Brāhmaṇical 
accolades1177 at the very same moment they are characterized as one’s whose inner subjectivity 
is devoted to recollecting the feet of Śiva (haracaraṇasmaraṇāṃtaḥkaraṇa). 
Even if we decide that Jñānarāśi really was an interloper, we still confront the enormous 
problem posed by the temple itself, for which Jñānarāśi is most certainly not responsible. Faced 
with the obvious issue that its iconography was inappropriate to mid-thirteenth century 
standards, someone seems to have taken a chisel and chipped out most of the panels. 
Thankfully for us, they missed some rather pertinent details that will assist in filling in the 
gaps.

1317First of all, because the image was too high up on the śikhara and can only really been seen 
with a zoom-in lens, the pious vandals retained a dancing Naṭeśa suggestively carrying a skull 
staff. 
A more important indication of the actual nature of the religious tradition observed by our 
hyper-Brāhmaṇical but not so orthoprax Brāhmaṇical “Four Hundred” is suggested by the 
interior ceiling of the temple of Purasiddhēśvara itself. Here, again, the arrangement and 
iconography are so subtle that it would be likely to be overlooked by an outsider. Even if it 
was noticed, its significance would not have been readily apparent, at least if you do not spend 
much of your time either studying or practicing Śākta Kaula ritual systems. For person so 
committed or preoccupied, however, the significance of Purasiddhēśvara’s representation of a 
1318 
fierce dancing Śiva, having just slain the elephant demon and holding the creature’s skin aloft 
in the air while encircled by vividly rendered images of—not seven—but eight mother 
goddesses is an unmistakable tip of the hat at the Kaula commitments of this temple and its 
esteemed caretakers. 
Confusing the picture even more, as was earlier alluded to, Purasiddhēśvara also hosts a series 
of images evocative of the visual register of later Vīraśaiva traditions, where Śaiva yogins and 
deities offer worship to what will later be called iṣṭaliṅgas. In article from 1969 published in 
1319 
Artibus Asiae, the great art historian M. S. Nagaraja Rao1178 analyzes and documents a number 
of images, some of them found scattered throughout Haveri that seem to have once belonged 
to the temple, and some preserved in situ. The figures in question include a Umāmaheśvara, a 
strange life-size figured holding an iṣṭaliṅga which he identifies as Viṣṇu worshipping Śiva, a 
standing figure of the goddess Mahālakṣmī of Kolhapur, an image of Sūrya, and some Nāgas. 
Once again, we have a pantheon that self-evidently speaks to the commitments of the 
Kaulicized tradition of the worship of Mahālaksṃī, one of the dominant forms of Śākta religion 
in the Early Medieval Deccan.

1320 
The denouement of our story is rather amusing. After investing all that time and effort 
in restoring Haveri to its rightful Brāhmaṇa owners, Kandharāya and its commanders seem to 
have eventually realized that despite their hyper-Brāhmaṇical affect, something about the 
Nānvvara and their actual mode of worship was not quite kosher. Granted, this is only a 
hypothesis, but this would certainly explain why, in the next grant at Haveri issued in 1255 CE 
during Kandharāya’s reign, not only are the nānūrvvaru nowhere to be found—indeed they 
seem never to resurface—but the focus of the grant is a temple formerly belonging to the god 
of blacksmiths (Kalmeśvara) and its purpose is to record the installation of a Śrī Gopīnātha.1179 
Most likely, the god in question is a form of Kṛṣṇa Vāsudeva, for in place of the nānūrvvaru 
and the descendants of Rudradēva, we find the descendants of a certain Bommarsa, the most 
important one (boṃmarsaruṃ avara putrapautrādigaḷuṃ mukhyavāgi) at the head of 
community of honored Bhāgavatas (bhāgavatajanaṃgaḷuṃ), Vaiṣṇavas following the 
Bhāgavata Purāṇa. As for what happens to Purasiddhēśvara itself, when it next surfaces under 
the reign of Mahādeva, the place has been given to the followers of the proto-Vīraśaiva saint 
Siddharāmeśvara of Sonnalige, who perhaps were responsible for the commission of the life- 
size image that now sits in the temple’s garbhagṛha, of someone —possibly a six-armed 
Viṣṇu— worshipping the śivaliṅga now addressed as Siddhēśvara.

Setting aside such interesting digressions, it is striking how systematically the story of 
the re-institutionalization of Haveri at the direction of the Seuṇa state, in its disavowal of the 
realities of the immediate Seuṇa past, its tearing down and delegitimization of older Śākta- 
tinged social forms, its recentering of Brāhmaṇas judged by their sattvic conduct, in its 
elevation of Mīmāṃsā and Nyāya as newly indispensable defenders of an institutionalized 
Vedāntic theism, and its embrace of inquiry into the Purāṇic corpus as an authoritative source 
for religious guidance, is emblematic of the driving forces that animate the emerging Seuṇa 
episteme. It is this worldview that find its most influential and eloquent expression in the 
writings of the chief administrator, minister, and de facto ruler of the Seuṇa kingdom, the 
polymath Hemādri Sūri, whose vast Caturvargacintāmaṇi—the Wish-Fulfilling Gem of the 
1322 
Four Classes—sets out transpose such a seemingly eccentric perspective into the dominant 
lived reality throughout the western Deccan. 
Prelude, The Caturvargacintāmaṇi: Encountering the Text through Its “Lost” Division on Tīrtha 
The great Dharmaśāstrin K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar begins his edition of the first volume of 
Lakṣmīdhara’s Kṛtyakalpataru,1180 our oldest surviving dharmanibandha, by lamenting the 
disinterest of nineteenth century Indologists in the study of the later dharma literature. 
Essentially, once it was discovered that these vast works of jurisprudence did not contain the 
type of textual record of positive Hindu law that could be readily made use of by colonial 
administrators, and that in fact the texts were lousy with the type of “purely religious’” 
materials that the colonial powers had a deemed to fall outside of the purview of European 
regulation, the discipline was largely confined to the ash heap of history. So too, for that matter, 
were the practitioners of the knowledge system, for they represented the type of autonomous 
disciplinary mode of power, trespassing on the self-evidently “secular” domain of the law and 
often closely linked with the princely states, that posed an obvious challenge to the emerging 
values of the colonial project. The twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have seen 
enormous advances in our understanding of both the history of classical Dharmaśāstra as 
discipline and of its complicated reception history in the context of the colonial encounter. In 
this regard, we stand particularly indebted to Ludo and Rosane Rocher and their students, a 
legacy continued in the writings of Donald Davis, and of Patrick Olivelle, and his disciples. 
Throughout the current work, I have turned to these resources again and again in his analysis 
and it would be remiss not acknowledge once again how these writings have made his own

arguments possible. That being said, when it comes to the domain of the dharmanibandha 
(with the notable exception of the important contribution of a critical edition of the 
Kṛtyakalpataru’s Dānakāṇḍa by David Brick, a work that confines its engagement to its 
specific topic, as well as an insightful essay on textual reuse by Florinda De Simini), the study 
of dharmanibandha, either in terms of its history or as an intellectual practice, has seen scarcely 
any advances since the establishment of India as an independent nation. Where the texts are 
consulted at all—this in and of itself is none too frequently compared to their considerable 
influence—they are mined for citations with scant attention paid to textual methods and modes 
of argumentation as they are exercised by individual authors. It is simply assumed that 
nibandha authors, adhering to an ahistorical “Brāhmaṇical orthodoxy,” share a worldview and 
a common ideology that the texts presuppose but do not themselves explicate any further. The 
nibandhas, from this perspective, operate as mere encyclopedias compiling in a single place 
already well-known principles and practices. As we will soon see, in the case of the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi in particular, such assumptions represent egregious misrepresentations 
of the actual contents of work that is in almost every domain self-consciously innovative, self- 
evidently constructivist in its approach, and abounding in extended—sometimes hundred page 
long—theoretical discourses on a whole range of topics, self-reflexively engaging with the 
very sort of methodological and theological questions that have been presumed to be absent 
from the discourse. 
Apart from the general neglect to which the discipline of dharmanibandha has been 
undeservedly subjected, part of the reason that the Caturvargacintāmaṇi itself has not received 
the attention that its outsized influence on the history of Indian religions warrants is the 
abominable state of the published text. In comparison with the Kṛtyakalpataru, whose every 
1324 
division Aiyangar prefaces with a learned English introduction that not only carefully surveys 
the contents and structure of the text but presents numerous topical essays on history and 
method, Bharatacandra Siromani’s (1873–1911) Caturvargacintāmaṇi not only provides its 
readers with almost no meaningful paratexts in any language, but as we will soon see, prints a 
highly incomplete version of the root text that nowhere acknowledges its tentative and partial 
nature. As Hemādri himself tells us repeatedly, the Caturvargacintāmaṇi is envisioned as 
consisting of four topical divisions (khaṇḍas)—presented in sequence—on vrata, dāna, tīrtha, 
and mokṣa. This main portion of the text is then supplemented by a voluminous “Remainder 
Division,” or Pariśeṣakhaṇḍa. The Pariśeṣakhaṇḍa incorporates “extra materials” such as 
astrological calculations for determining festival dates, the procedures for temple construction 
and consecration, as well as a multivolume discussion of the different forms of śrāddha rites. 
These later books, contained within the Pariśeṣa, are explicitly envisioned as kalpa texts, 
supplementing the main focus of the work as found in the first four khaṇḍas. While the majority 
of each portion of the text consists of a curated array of textual citations on a given subtopic 
drawn from across a vast array of source, supplemented by commentary, prayogas, as well as 
vidhānas supplied by the author, Hemādri also tells us every division is to include a section on 
methodological concerns as they apply to the Dharmaśāstrin practitioner eager to translate 
textual study into real-world practice. Furthermore, each section also proffers theoretical and 
apologetic reflections addressing how the topics at hand relate to problematics drawn from the 
wider world of śāstra. 
In this way, quite unlike his immediate predecessors, our author consciously sets out to 
justify the inclusion within the field of Dharmaśāstra of a set of “religious” concerns—namely, 
occasional religious vows (vrata), pilgrimage (tīrtha), as well as festival planning and temple 
1325 
consecration—that had until recently fallen entirely outside the purview of the discipline of 
Dharmaśāstra. In the same spirit, in an unprecedented fashion, Hemādri has interwoven into 
his work what are essentially a series of mini-intellectual essays, addressing such matters as 
the relationship between Purāṇic worship and questions of caste as well as the real nature of 
Brāhmaṇa-hood. In essence, what the text sets out to offer its reader is an entirely new 
paradigm, at least within the realm of śāstra, for what it means to be a Brāhmaṇa who wields 
religious authority. 
Unfortunately, the published edition of the text hardly does justice to this interpretive 
program. The Caturvargacintāmaṇi has only been published in a single four-volume (with 
seven parts in total) edition produced by the Asiatic Society of Bengal beginning in 1873.1181 
The edition in question prints an incomplete version of the Vratakhaṇḍa (missing a portion of 
its introduction), a competent version of the Dānakhaṇḍa, entirely overlooks the Tīrthakhaṇḍa 
(still extent in several manuscripts), and omits the lost Mokṣakhaṇḍa. Even more 
problematically, it prints only portions of the Pariśeṣakhaṇḍa—omitting the two parts of the 
pratiṣṭhā kalpa—and it does so in the incorrect order, effectively occluding the internal 
structure of these divisions of the text. By treating Hemādri’s division on śrāddha as an 
additional khaṇḍa, and not as a kalpa work as its author intended, the edition misrepresents the 
place of Śrāddha in his overall system. And then, as if to add insult to injury, with the exclusion 
of the original printing, so far as I can determine, every reprint of the text as constituted by 
1181Bharatacandra Siromani, ed., Chaturvarga Chintamani, 4 vols. (Calcutta: Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1873– 1911). The first portion of the Śrāddhakalpa has also been edited, using better manuscript material, by Visvanatha Sastri of Kashi in the 1970s. Unfortunately, the portion of the text on which he had worked has little overlap with the materials we will be discussing in this chapter, and his intentions to re-edit the CVC in its entirety never came to fruition. 
1326 
Bharatacandra Siromani have themselves omitted an entire volume’s worth of material 
contained within the śrāddhakalpa. 
In other words, to be charitable, the text with which the edition presents us is both 
tentative and incomplete. Even more problematically, given the relatively early date of its 
production, when a more critical philology had yet to have been integrated into pandit culture, 
much as you might expect, the edition tells us nothing about the source materials. Though 
occasionally spare variant readings are given in the lower margin, in the absence of any 
reflection by the editor Bharatacandra Siromani, we do not even how many manuscripts were 
used in constituting the printed edition. Every indication suggests, however, that the quality 
of this source material was relatively poor and incomplete.1182 
Indeed, the overall impression one has of both the reprints of the text (which reproduce 
all of the errors uniformly, including blurred text) as well as the original is that a decided lack 
of care went into their constitution. Facing such an admittedly monumental task, the editor 
Bharatacandra Siromani, who was responsible for several other Dharmaśāstra editions of much 
higher quality, may simply have delegated much of the work to retrained traditional scribes 
with minimal command of the language. It seems that in some cases they may just have 
transcribed what they found on the page with little if any reflection on the coherence of what 
they were printing. This would provide us with a charitable explanation for the sorry state of 
large swathes of the work, where whole pages are missing case endings and abound in 
ametrical verses. It would also account for the fact that the edition, which once again contains 
1182This early colonial context also accounts for the rather unfortunate choice of fonts. As I have spent many a night lamenting, all six thousand pages of the work are transmitted in a Bengali-inflected variant on Devanagari. Intrinsically already more difficult to read, as the font does not clearly differentiate between many of the vowel markers, such that long ī and o are often hard to distinguish, over the course of numerous reprintings, the visual quality of the font has further degraded, resulting in a frequent and annoying blurring of characters and loss of anusvāras. 
1327no substantive introduction or apparatuses, offers us a number of obviously incomplete 
khaṇḍas presented in the wrong order. Indeed, despite the fact that Hemādri explains the 
structure of his project explicitly dozens of times across the divisions, the editor has mistaken 
the middle of the work, on dāna, for the beginning, which is about vrata. Bharatacandra 
Siromami also has incorporated an obviously spurious section on prāyaścitta, which does not 
confirm in form, function, or patterns of citation to anything that came before in the work.1183 
Bharatacandra Siromani’s treatment of the two thousand, two hundred- and ninety- 
page Vratakhaṇḍa, which he misidentifies as the second division of the work, is particularly 
egregious. As printed, the text simply abruptly begins: “First division: Now, a praise of the 
author of the text” (prathamo ’adhyāyaḥ / atha granthakarttuḥ praśastiḥ). In contrast, the 
manuscript tradition in Devanāgarī (for example, Item 1620 from the Indic Manuscripts 
Collection at the University of Pennsylvania) consistently prefaces the quite extensive self- 
praise by our author with a verse honoring Kṛṣṇa, followed by a fifty-two verse “rājapraśasti” 
celebrating the line of the Seuṇa Yādavas. The text here is largely identical with the extract 
first identified and edited by Bhandarkar as clearly belonging to the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, but 
whose precise provenance that great scholar was unable to determine.1184 Reading the CVC’s 
Vratakhaṇḍa in some approximation of the form that its author intended—such that does not 
simply begin with Hemādri praising himself for most of the first twenty verses—a very 
different rhetorical structure is in evidence, and we suddenly have a substantive answer to the 
1183Siromani’s edition presents the Dānakhaṇḍa, Vratakhaṇḍa, Śraddhākhaṇḍa, and multipart and rather incomplete Pariśeṣakhaṇḍa, and Prāyaścittakhaṇḍa in sequence, seemingly oblivious to the fact that the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s author habitually explains the actual intended order of his magnum opus (Vratakhaṇḍa, Dānakhaṇḍa, Tīrthakhaṇḍa, Śraddhākhaṇḍa, Mokṣakhaṇḍa, Pariśeṣakhaṇḍa) several dozen times over the course of the printed text and provides numerous remarks that would call into question the authenticity of the Prāyaścittakhaṇḍa. 1184Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, Collected Works of Sir R. G. Bhandarkar: Early History of the Deccan and Miscellaneous Historical Essays (Pune: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1927). 
1328 
pressing question of how a work such as this produced in a royal court under Seuṇa patronage, 
as printed barely mentions the dynasty at all in its first two-thousand pages. 
In a similar spirit, it is quite certain that meticulous philological work making use of 
the available manuscript evidence would help us clear up many such mysteries. In an ideal 
world, an examination of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi would be preceded, at the very least, by 
the compilation and collating of a representative sampling of the manuscript evidence. Done 
properly, the sheer scale of the work that would be involved, to say nothing of the financial 
burden a researcher would incur in consulting and procuring in many cases hundreds of five 
hundred plus folio manuscripts, in and off itself is virtually prohibitive. It would take a team 
of people decades to simply to go through each exemplum, transcribe it, and collate them all 
together. In order to critically examine Hemādri’s use of his sources, and to choose among the 
variants, many of the Purāṇas he references would themselves have to be critically edited. In 
short, it is a project that could occupy a community of gifted scholars for entire lifetimes. Given 
the fact that nearly one hundred and fifty years have elapsed without even the slightest 
indication that any such critical effort might be forthcoming, during which one of the most 
innovative and influential works in the history of Sanskrit thought has simply been left to 
languish, it seems better to try our hands at working to make sense what are admittedly quite 
inadequate texts instead of waiting expectantly for perfect conditions that may never arrive. 
Partially inspired by the disjointed condition of Bharatacandra Siromani’s edition, we 
will be approaching the vast Caturvargacintāmaṇi in very different fashion than its author 
would have intended. To this effect, we will commence our investigation not primarily by 
facilitating an encounter with Hemādri’s own wildly innovative and theologically rich 
representation of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s interpretive project (that will be the focus of the 
1329 
next chapter), but by attending to the manner in which Hemādri sets out to reshape, redact, and 
transform the textual, cultural, and religious resources he inherits from the world of the early 
medieval Deccan. 
In the sections that follow, our primary conceptual focus will be on reading Hemādri 
as a redactor and reimaginer of pre-existing textual and religious cultures. In these efforts, 
initially our primary archive will be selections from the unpublished Tīrthakhaṇḍa itself, which 
I read here from manuscript for the first time. After introducing the reader to the evidence 
recovered so far regarding the status of the unpublished Tīrthakhaṇḍa of the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi, we will begin by exploring portions of the theoretical framework for 
thinking about and performing pilgrimage that the text proposes in its first chapter. Our primary 
intention here is to clarify how Hemādri’s treatment of pilgrimage at once builds upon and 
repudiates earlier discussions of the topic in dharma literature as well as in relation to extra- 
Dharmaśāstra conversations about the nature and function of pilgrimage in broader circulation 
throughout the early medieval Deccan. Once we have reconstructed Hemādri’s overall theory 
of pilgrimage, we will then attend to what his śāstric prose might tell us about the specific 
intellectual resources that inform his mode of argumentation. Laying the foundations for 
arguments that will be more fully developed in the next chapter, which tackle head on how 
Hemādri justifies the use of Smṛti and Purāṇa as sources for religious guidance independent of 
the Vedas, we will see that Hemādri’s theory of dharmanibandha is at once subtly and heavily 
indebted to cutting edge thinking drawn from the realm of both Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā and the 
emerging tradition of the “new” and more emphatically theistic Nyāya.1185 
1185Readers will note that throughout we will speak of a “new” Nyāya, but not however, of Navya Nyāya. This is because Hemādri draws upon an emerging Nyāya discourse, beginning with Jayanta Bhaṭṭa that, though it breaks subsequently from the stances and methods of the Nyāyabhāṣya, has not yet developed the mode of reasoning 
1330 
Setting theoretical themes aside, in the next section, we will turn to an examination of 
how Hemādri reworks his sources in the service of denaturalizing the ethos underwriting the 
Tantric imaginaries of the Deccan. Here, our efforts will be focused on a close reading of a 
small portion of the Tīrthakhaṇḍa text that draws heavily upon the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya, 
found in the vulgate edition of the Skanda Purāṇa.1186 As we have already begun to see, within 
the Seuṇa Yādava imperium during the latter half of the thirteenth century, such efforts were 
no mere theoretical enterprise, but formed a plan of action for reshaping the actual religious 
landscape. The religious landscape we will be exploring in particular is the sacred fields 
surrounding the Śaiva tīrtha in Saurashtra called Somanātha, which at the time remained one 
of the most important ritual centers on the subcontinent. Retaining throughout this focus on 
specific “lived spaces” and the theological and juridical frameworks that make them possible, 
we next turn to selected portions of the Dānakhaṇḍa, where we find Hemādri hard at work 
reinventing the theoretical parameters of philanthropy (dāna) and offering a new standardizing 
formalization of philanthropic ritual. Through a clever manipulation of his sources, most of 
them inherited directly from Lakṣmīdhara, Hemādri excludes the types of social agents that 
populate the Śaiva Age while at the same time dismantling the legal framework that 
underwrites the institution of the undying land grant upon which Tantric knowledge systems 
depended for material support. 
and technical language of Navya Nyāya proper. Navya Nyāya proper commences with Gaṅgeśa, whose Tattvacintāmaṇi Hemādri does not seem to know. 1186The text in question, printed in the early twentieth century, is almost entirely distinct in its contents from the Nepalese Skanda Purāṇa. The materials it contains seem to be entirely unknown to Lakṣmīdhara’s Kṛtyakalpataru. The relation of the vulgate to the wider manuscript tradition remains a matter for future research, though the extensive reference Hemādri makes to most of the divisions of the text suggests that while individual chapters likely contain many interpolations, its main structural and topical elements have already assumed some semblance of its modern form by the middle of the thirteenth century. Khemraj Krishnadas ed., Prabhāsa-khaṇḍa 1. Prabhāsa-kṣetra-māh., 2. Vastrāpatha-kṣetra-māh., 3. Arbuda-kh., 4. Dvārakā-māh (Bombay: 1910). 
1331 
Having arrived at some degree of understanding of how Hemādri manages the cultural 
memory about sacred spaces as well as the harnessing of resources that makes possible their 
establishment and institutional persistence, we will then turn to understanding the changing 
relationship within the tradition of Dharmaśāstra towards the construction and 
institutionalization of temples complexes by non-Brāhmaṇa agents using non-Brāhmaṇa 
knowledge systems. First, we will look Hemādri’s immediate predecessors in the world of 
Dharmaśāstra to see what they have to say about the relation of traditions of temple building 
to the social norms they seek to enforce. As will become apparent, though they share a century 
and make use of many of the same sources, the twelfth-century writer Aparāditya I of the 
Northern Koṅkaṇa and Lakṣmīdhara of Varanasi approach the topic from diametrically 
opposed points of view. From there, stepping back from the prescriptive realm of śāstra and 
back into the “real world,” we will see how the Seuṇa Yādavas in practice marshal the 
conceptual resources outlined in the Caturvargacintāmaṇi in the service of destroying the 
Trika-aligned Siddhakṣetra at Kukkunur, evicting its Kālamukha preceptors and esoteric Śākta 
deities and replacing them with pious Brāhmaṇas who conduct worship directed to “all the 
gods.” In reconstructing Hemādri’s own position, our analysis will draw heavily on the 
unpublished Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati of Hemādri’s Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s, one of the many 
components of the Pariśeṣakhaṇḍa that have not been included in the printed edition. Here, 
we will see how Hemādri confronts head-on the epistemic values of the classical pratiṣṭhā 
tradition, exemplified by the Piṅgalāmata, wherein space is conceptually differentiated, 
multivocal ritual addressing disparate imagined audiences are conducted concurrently, and 
sacrality is defined by sovereignty. At his direction, this episteme is methodically replaced 
with a new theology for imagining and instantiating the Hindu temple that emphasizes the 
1332 
singular and shared nature of the ritual, utter transparency in its performance that leaves no 
space for secrets, and the continued dependence of the institution on the state. This will prepare 
us for the final chapter, where first we will engage with Hemādri’s intellectual project on its 
own terms as an emancipatory intervention in the world of śāstra as well as lived religion, and 
then with our author’s elevation of a theistic form of Advaita Vedānta aligned with the values 
of early modernity as the new and lasting core of Brāhmaṇical knowledge. 
Placing and Displacing the Dharmas of Place: Pilgrimage in the Tīrthakhaṇḍa 
In his groundbreaking Marathi language monograph Śrīviṭṭhal: Ek Mahāsamanvay, which 
Anne Feldhaus has felicitously rendered into English as The Rise of a Folk God: Vitthal of 
Pandharpur, the great autodidact Ramachandra Chintamani Dhere sets out to demonstrate the 
authenticity and antiquity of the Pāṇḍuraṅgamāhātmya, a major Sanskrit resource for the 
worship of Viṭṭhal.1187 Towards this end, Dhere assembles a considerable body of evidence to 
convince his reader that Hemādri’s Caturvargacintāmaṇi did in fact once contain a 
Tīrthakhaṇḍa and that the text had incorporated a reflection on the god at Pandharpur. Perhaps 
most convincingly, Dhere directs our attention to the Viṭṭhalabhūṣaṇa, a work by a famously 
meticulous nineteenth-century pandit by the name of Gopalacarya. As Dhere demonstrates, 
this text contains numerous citations that the author himself identifies as extracted from the 
Tīrthakhaṇḍa of Hemādri. Dhere proceeds to identify numerous shared citations from this 
work, preserved in the seventeenth-century Vīramitrodaya of Mitramiśra, also identified in situ 
as derived from Hemādri, as well as in the Tīrthasāra, an early fifteenth-century work of 
Dharmaśāstra composed by Dalapatirāja a mere hundred years after Hemādri would have died. 
In short, he proves conclusively that text was not merely composed but that it remained in 
1187Ramchandra Chintamani Dhere, The Rise of a Folk God: Vitthal of Pandharpur, trans. Anne Feldhaus (New York: Oxford University Press, 2011), 19–35. 
1333 
circulation, at least among royal libraries, into the colonial period. As Dhere quite helpfully 
explains: Mahāmahopādhyāya Gopāḷācārya Aṇṇā Ghaḷsāsī Karhāḍkar. . . quotes ten verses, beginning with the words “bhaimyāś caiva taṭe devi. . . .,” that he states are found “in Hemādri’s Tīrthakhaṇḍa[khaṇḍa] (tīrthahemādrau), folio 122.” Gopāḷācārya also states clearly exactly where he saw the Tīrthakhaṇḍa: “This Tīrthakhaṇḍa of Hemādri’s is in the Raṅgamandir in Vṛndāraṇya. There are 600 pages of it there. The rest of it can be seen elsewhere, in the royal capitals of Aḷavara, Jambū, and so on.”1188 
Gopalacarya seems to have been implying that even the six hundred folio version of 
the text then preserved at the Raṅgamandir in Vrindavan, which thus far remains untraceable, 
was itself hardly complete. This gives us some hint of the vast nature of the original version of 
the work as well as the inadequacy of the evidence with which we are working. Inadequate 
evidence, however, is infinitely better than no evidence at all. While neither the text nor even 
the location of the version preserved at “Jambū” can be determined, I have managed to retrieve 
images of the work Gopalacarya identifies was preserved at Alwar (Aḷavara), for even now the 
Royal Collection at Alwar does indeed contain an incomplete 349 folio version of Hemādri’s 
Tīrthakhaṇḍa, which in fact transmits the very verses Gopāḷācārya has cited.1189 
1188Dhere, The Rise of a Folk God, 19. 1189The Puṇḍarīkakṣetramāhātmya within Hemādri’s Tīrthakhaṇḍa, which celebrates the god commonly called Viṭṭhal at Pandharpur, cites from two sources. One of these is a much-truncated version of what is now called the Pāṇḍuraṅgamāhātmya, though only the first three chapters of the text are drawn upon. The other is an otherwise unattested māhātmya contained within the Kūrma Purāṇa, a sample citation from which is reproduced here verbatim as found in the manuscript: atha puṇḍarīkakṣetramāhātmyam / tatra praśaṃsā kurmapurāṇe puṃḍarīkaṃ mahātīrthaṃ brāhmaṇair upasevitam / tatrābhigamya yuktātmā pumḍarīkaṃ phalam labhet / 
More importantly for our purposes, the manuscript contains virtually verbatim the exact passage cited by the Viṭṭhalabhūṣaṇa, which contains slight variants from the published Pāṇḍuraṅgamāhātmya. Viṭṭhalabhūṣaṇa: “tīrthahemādrau— bhaimyāś caiva taṭe devi dakṣiṇe tīrtham uttamam. . . .” Hemādri, Tīrthakhaṇḍa: bhaimyāś caiva taṭe devi dakṣiṇe tīrtham uttamam / asti kṣetre daivataṃ ca sarvotkṛṣṭaṃ sudurlabham. . . . pauṇḍarīkam iti khyātaṃ tat tīrthaṃ kṣetrapūjitaḥ / pāṇḍurāṅkaś ca tatrāste mūrtimān devatottamaḥ / tathā / puṣkarāt triguṇaṃ proktaṃ kedārāt ṣaḍguṇaṃ bhavet / vārāṇasyāṃ daśaguṇam anantam śrīgirer iti /. . . . ṣaṣṭivarṣasahasrāṇi divyadevatādarśanāt / yat phalaṃ labhate martyaḥ sakṛd eva hi tat phalaṃ / durlabhaṃ mānuṣajanma tatrāpy acyutasevanaṃ / Note in particular the retention of the archaic form of the name of the deity as “pāṇḍurāṅka,” attested in the inscriptional record, in place of the early modern “pāṇḍuraṅga.” 
1334 
The opening folio of Hemādri’s Tīrthakhaṇḍa as preserved at Alwar bearing the seal of the king. 
The image you see above offers a part of the Tīrthakhaṇḍa’s praśasti of the Seuṇa 
kings.1190 Not only has the first folio, along with much else besides, been lost, but the text from 
which this was copied itself seems to have been compromised so that the scribe has 
indiscriminately copied onto single folios what would have formed entirely distinct sections 
within the original work. This would account for why the fourth folio in our manuscript 
abruptly transitions from Hemādri praising himself to a discussion, in media res, of 
Mahākāleśvara at Ujjain.1191 Quite apart from the fact that in its present form the semantic 
content of the text is no longer contiguously transmitted and often has to be pieced back 
together, it would appear we are also missing a good portion of some early chapters as well as 
the entire end of the treatise.1192 Even so, we must be grateful that at nearly 350 double sided 
1190As the manuscript folio above proclaims, the text we are reading from is listed as L. 3891 in the Alwar handlist. 1191The opening portion of this exploration of Mahākāḷeśvara in the Alwar manuscript is actually located on folio 227. 1192The end as we have it is full of pages where most of the akṣaras have been marked as lost and deals with māhātmyas associated with Gayā in Bihar. In Hemādri’s introduction to the beginning of the division of the text that is supposed to treat Gayā, our author quite clearly identifies this subject as one of the earlier topics to be 
1335 
folios containing eleven lines of roughly fifty-two akṣaras each, the text as transmitted offers 
us a substantive encounter with Hemādri’s chosen textual archives, certainly enough to 
familiarize ourself with his core methodology and editorial choices. 
The sacred geography the Tīrthakhaṇḍa attempts to cover is vast and pan-Indic. It 
extends as far south as the Setubandha, Rāmeśvara in Tamil Nadu, as far west as Multan in 
present day Pakistan, at least as far north as Kashmir, and as far east as Puri in Orissa.1193 The 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi treats each of the different regions of the subcontinent in considerable 
detail, drawing upon a range of sources, mostly Purāṇic māhātmyas, many of which do not 
survive or are yet unpublished. Unexpectedly, in curating his canon of sacred sites, Hemādri’s 
selections do not in any way privilege either the Brāhmaṇical heartland of Āryavārta or the 
particular sacred geographies of the western Deccan contiguous with the Seuṇa imperium. 
Such comprehensiveness and impartiality in the realm of sacred geography diverges quite 
sharply from the only preceding work on tīrtha to emerge from the discourse of Brāhmaṇical 
Dharmaśāstra: the comparatively terse Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa of Lakṣmīdhara’s 
Kṛtyakalpataru.1194 At least among the surviving sources, the Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa marks the 
initial moment in the history of śāstra where pilgrimage (tīrthayātrā) is incorporated into a 
self-described common canon of “Brāhmaṇical” praxis deemed fit for scholastic reflection. 
This is quite fitting, for as we shall see, the surprisingly short Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa forms but 
a single division of the gargantuan dharmanibandha, the Kṛtyakalpataru, a work of 
covered in a chapter that in fact may have been intended to conclude with the extensive discussion of Prabhāsakṣetra that now makes up much of the first forty folios of the work as transmitted. 1193This last place for Hemādri must have been of considerable personal importance. Among all of the places where he takes his reader, it is only his sadly rather damaged discussion of Puri that travels together with an elaborate ritual paddhati. Unlike in other places in the text, this Pañcarātravidhāna cites no explicit sources and thus was either composed by Hemādri himself or plausibly formed part of a ritual tradition with which he was familiar. 1194K.

Dharmaśāstra that for the first time joins the discrete domains of Hindu law and Purāṇic 
religious practices. We will explore this text and its author, the Gāhaḍavāla chief minister and 
master of war, Lakṣmīdhara—who stands in many ways as the most significant antecedent and 
counterpart to Hemādri and his interpretive project—in considerable detail in the next chapter, 
where we will painstakingly contextualize Hemādri’s contributions within the history of 
Dharmaśāstra. For the moment, however, it is simply worth observing that while Hemādri is 
transparently indebted to Lakṣmīdhara—indeed the raw textual materials that structure the 
opening division of each of the major chapters of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi are transposed 
directly from the Kṛtyakalpataru—in nearly every case, Hemādri makes use of Lakṣmīdhara’s 
sources as a jumping off point for arriving at theoretically distinctive—even oppositional— 
conceptual ends. Both literally and figuratively, the Caturvargacintāmaṇi sets out to tackle a 
different terrain. 
As a simple but compelling illustration of this dynamic, let us compare Hemādri’s 
transregional inclusivism with what we find in the Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa itself. In contrast with 
our text, after nine pages on tīrthayātrā in the abstract, Lakṣmīdhara dedicates one hundred 
and twenty-six pages to discussing a single place, Varanasi.1195 None too coincidentally, this 
is the most important sacred center within the Gāhaḍavāla realm. The text then proceeds in the 
following manner: Prayāga next receives sixteen pages worth of coverage, the Gaṅgā receives 
nine, Gayā gets twelve, Kurukṣetra gets eight, Puṣkāra four, and Mathura nine.1196 In other 
words, the vast majority of Tīrthavivecana takes as its focus a specifically north Indian sacred 
geography that centers the Indo-Gangetic Plain as the locus mundi in general and the

1337Gāhaḍavāla realm in particular. With the exception of the Narmadā river, though not strictly 
north Indian, also adjacent to Gāhaḍavāla territory, and the eleven other sacred centers that 
warrant their own chapter, places like Dvāraka and Kedāra all must make do with two or three 
pages. In fact, excluding the extensive section on Varanasi, at twenty-six pages in length, the 
longest division of the Tīrthavivecana is the chapter on the greatness of “various tīrthas” 
(nānatīrthamāhātmya).1197 While this portion of the text nominally acknowledges a long 
catalog of sacred centers found on other parts of the subcontinent, each place is allotted at best 
a few ślokas, and the whole discussion reads as an afterthought. 
In contrast to the Tīrthavivecana of the Kṛtyakalpataru, whose sacred geographies, as 
we have just seen are largely restricted to the Indo-Gangetic Plain and are organized according 
to geographical proximity to the political territory of its patron, on the basis of surviving 
colophons, we can be certain that Hemādri originally organized the Tīrthakhaṇḍa’s 
presentation of sacred sites not on account of their location, but rather by type. While much of 
the theoretical apparatus of the text is not transmitted in our partial and disorderly manuscript, 
on the basis of the surviving internal colophons we know for certain that, following some initial 
chapters theorizing pilgrimage, at the very least the text offered in sequence a division on 
sacred fields (kṣetraprakaraṇa), on sacred rivers (nadīprakaraṇa), on sacred cities 
(purīprakaraṇa), and on sacred forests (vanaprakaraṇa). Though the precise definition of 
some of these categories remains a bit obscure, we also have strong internal textual indications 
that in its original form, each of the divisions would have been prefaced with sections where 
our author clearly delineated the exact meaning of the category under discussion and attempted 
to place them within the wider context of śāstric knowledge. In more abstract terms, Hemādri 
1197Lakṣmīdhara, Kṛtyakalpataru: Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa, 234–257. 
1338 
breaks from his predecessor in that instead of deriving an organizational program for his śāstric 
treatments from the parameters provided to him by the world itself—such as the principles of 
geographical proximity and the exigencies supplied by the political sovereignty of his patron 
at a specific moment in historical time—he sets out to order the world itself so as to bring it 
under the domain of synthetic śāstric taxonomies. 
On the basis of the Alwar manuscript and some of its more important surviving 
intertexts, especially the Kṛtyakalpataru, I have been able to reconstruct one substantial portion 
of the introductory prescriptive and theoretical framework that once prefaced the complete 
Tīrthakhaṇḍa. As we will see momentarily, though it is currently preserved on non-consecutive 
pages between folios 230–240 of our manuscript, this portion of the discourse—almost 
certainly the beginning of our text—ostensibly offers further elucidation on the opening 
chapter of Lakṣmīdhara’s Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa.1198 On the surface, what the text appears to be 
doing is incorporating—often verbatim and in sequence—not only five pages worth of 
Lakṣmīdhara’s curation of citations on the fruits of tīrthayātrā drawn from the Mahābhārata 
as well as a range of Purāṇas, but even a substantial portion of his admittedly sparse 
commentary—mostly consisting of glosses on some key terms contained in his proof texts. 
But whereas, beyond the bare fact that he for the first time incorporates “Purāṇic” religion into 
the realm Hindu law, Lakṣmīdhara in the Tīrthakāṇḍa has no discernable theological agenda 
guiding his selection and presentation of materials, nor does he display a hermeneutical 
commitment to making his grab bag of citations cohere intellectually, Hemādri’s intentions are 
vastly different. Succinctly, our author seeks to deploy the canon of sources he has acquired 
1198Specifically, Hemādri treats most of the contents presented on pages 3 through the top of 10 of the Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa, incorporating in toto about five pages worth of material, both citation and commentary. 
1339 
from his predecessor with the radically distinctive aim of imposing order upon what he sees as 
a heterogenous original. 
In preparation for our encounter with Hemādri’s project of building a new theological 
model out of what at first might seem to be isolated moments of textual exegesis—many of 
which build directly upon verbatim passages drawn from Lakṣmīdhara—before turning to the 
text, it is important we highlight the major contours of the argument interspersed throughout 
the Tīrthakhaṇḍa’s opening chapter. First, Hemādri domesticizes and reimagines the type of 
agent who performs pilgrimage, disassociating the act of pilgrimage from the performance of 
intense austerities. In blatant opposition to virtually all of his sources, Hemādri erases the 
understanding that the success or failure of a pilgrimage is largely predicated on how well the 
virtuoso practitioner has internalized a strident degree of ascetic self-discipline. This 
interpretive choice refashions the experience of pilgrimage into one that comforts the 
comfortably well to do. Second, again breaking from everything that precedes him, our author 
sets out to prove that all pilgrimages, independent of destination, are fundamentally the same 
sort of activity. On this basis, for the first time in the literature, he presents a standardized 
paradigm for how and why we do tīrthayātrā. Invoking the scholastic maxim of ekatra 
nirṇīta,1199 Hemādri asserts that just like different places (sthāna) within a text can be 
“harmonized” using reading strategies derived from Mīmāṃsā exegesis, so too can the 
ostensibly different modes of practice related to different places (sthāna) in the world. 
Though particularly conceptually significant, this is just one of many instances where 
Hemādri implicitly as well as explicitly makes a broader case—namely, that the fundamental 
ritual vocabulary that needs to be deployed during pilgrimage is founded not on local 
1199We will discuss the ekatranirṇīta nyāya and the role it plays within the Tīrthakhaṇḍa at some length below. 
1340 
knowledge and practice but on a set of meta-textual scholastic practices, many of which are 
derived from Bhāṭṭa and Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā exegesis as well as the later tradition of Nyāya. 
When we reach the end of this section, we will thus look both at some of the philosophical and 
theological conversations that stand behind his discourse and inspire Hemādri as well as the 
impact of Hemādri’s own intellectual work in the Tīrthakhaṇḍa on his early modern Smārta 
successors. 
On account of the close textual dependence of the opening portion of Hemādri’s 
Tīrthakhaṇḍa on the first chapter of Lakṣmīdhara’s Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa, it is vital that we 
read the texts in tandem. Much as we had done earlier in chapters two and four when working 
with documentary texts produced in accordance with inherited scribal templates, attending 
carefully to the places where Hemādri has inserted extensive material or has actively sought to 
rethink or subvert the objectives of his predecessor provides us with a powerful analytical tool 
for accessing just what facets of our author’s interpretive project were most important to him 
and would have been perceived as such by an intended audience familiar with both works. 
Especially when complemented (where possible) with a careful reading of both authors’ source 
texts, such an approach also brings into immediate and stark relief the many moments in which 
our nibandha plays fast and loose with or actively seeks to override the intended meaning of 
his proof texts so as to advance his own extratextual agenda. By seeking out textual echoes 
further afield from the expected realm of Purāṇa and Dharmaśāstra, we are also able to 
familiarize ourselves with the specific śāstric discourses that Hemādri has been attentively 
reading and that he seeks to establish as key parts of the interpretive context for his reinvention 
of a newly theistic and devotional non-sectarian Dharmaśāstra, a discipline now viewed as the 
primary site for governing and adjudicating a cornucopia of modes of religious practice. 
1341 
In the Kṛytakalpataru, book eight, Lakṣmīdhara introduces the topic of tīrthayātrā by 
citing an extended passage from the Tīrthayātrāparvan found in book three of the 
Mahābhārata, where the sage Pulastya teaches Bhīṣma about the virtues of pilgrimage.1200 
This is a quite appropriate choice, as the text in question appears to be the archaic locus 
classicus legitimizing the practice of pilgrimage within Sanskrit discourse. While the vast 
majority of the Mahābhārata’s chapter offers a detailed itinerary for a network of sacred sites, 
mostly in north India, with the pilgrimage commencing from Pushkar in Rajasthan, 
Lakṣmīdhara’s opening selection incorporates only seven of the verses that preface this 
discussion. These offer a rationale for pilgrimage. Lakṣmīdhara’s interpretive choice here, 
which Hemādri continues, is itself quite interesting, as it, for the moment, removes from our 
consideration the actual opening of Pulastya’s discourse, which treats the specific type of 
person who is eligible to perform the practice. This is quite pointedly someone who has 
thoroughly disciplined his senses through austerities, a topic that Lakṣmīdhara will somewhat 
soften and Hemādri will actively seek to expunge from his discourse. Pulastya then continues 
by indicating that while Vedic ritual is effective in accomplishing the aims associated with the 
ancestors as well as reaching heaven, it is not possible (na śakyāḥ) for poor people (daridraṃ) 
to “obtain” the sacrifice, as yajñas entail a considerable expenditure of wealth and ritual 
materials (bahūpakaraṇāḥ, nānāsaṃbhāravistarāḥ). While kings and successful men can 
acquire such resources, they remain out of reach for poorer folks “who have only a single 
1200Note that Lakṣmīdhara offers several readings that diverge, mostly inconsequentially, from the critical edition of the Mahābhārata. Mahābhārata 3.80.34–3.80.40: ṛṣibhiḥ kratavaḥ proktā vedeṣv iha yathākramam / phalaṃ caiva tathā tattvaṃ pretya ceha ca sarvaśaḥ // na te śakyā daridreṇa yajñāḥ prāptuṃ mahīpate / bahūpakaraṇā yajñā nānāsaṃbhāravistarāḥ // prāpyante pārthivair etaiḥ samṛddhair vā naraiḥ kvacit / nārthanyūnair avagaṇair ekātmabhir asaṃhataiḥ // yo daridrair api vidhiḥ śakyaḥ prāptuṃ sureśvara / tulyo yajñaphalaiḥ puṇyais taṃ nibodha yudhiṣṭhira // ṛṣīṇāṃ paramaṃ guhyam idaṃ bharatasattama / tīrthābhigamanaṃ puṇyaṃ yajñair api viśiṣyate // anupoṣya trirātrāṇi tīrthāny anabhigamya ca / adattvā kāñcanaṃ gāś ca daridro nāma jāyate // agniṣṭomādibhir yajñair iṣṭvā vipuladakṣiṇaiḥ / na tat phalam avāpnoti tīrthābhigamanena yat // 
1342 
body”—in other words, do not have servants at their beck and call. In this spirit of charity, the 
Mahābhārata thus teaches a vidhi, whose fruit is equal to that of yajña, that can be utilized 
even by poor folks. It calls this practice the supreme secret, proclaiming that it is at least as 
good if not better than doing Vedic ritual, and the section, as well as Lakṣmīdhara’s selection, 
then closes by suggesting that “real poverty” is not going on tīrthayātrā in accordance with the 
procedure enjoined by Pulastya. What is missing from this reusage, however, is any indication 
that in the original source, Pulastya’s vidhi is not some generic celebration of the concept of 
pilgrimage, but that the text offers instruction in a very specific linked set of practices, the 
observance of which is determined by travel to a fixed set of locations, evocative of a largely 
extinct proto-Śaiva sacred landscape. As the Mahābhārata makes clear, though bathing, 
honoring the ancestors, and feeding Brāhmaṇas are usually part of the package, at each of the 
different places the pilgrim will have to visit to fulfill the terms of the injunction, the practice 
engaged in and the rules that govern it are substantively different. 
Lakṣmīdhara, to be sure, discards Pulastya’s precise itinerary. One can hardly begrudge 
him this choice, as with the passage of perhaps a thousand years many of the places the text 
incorporates had disappeared or been thoroughly reimagined. And yet, in many ways he stays 
true to the spirit of Pulastya’s discourse to Bhīṣma, for in the chapters that follow, the 
Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa will represent pilgrimage to each of the different locations it covers as 
entailing divergent practices. Thus, while Lakṣmīdhara dedicates his first chapter—entitled the 
tīrthayātrāvidhi—to asserting the in many ways rather banal and delimited proposition that 
going to tīrthas releases one from sin, and then proceeds in the chapters that follow to offer the 
specific and often quite different practices associated with making pilgrimage to Kāśī, Prayāga, 
Gayā and so forth, as his Tīrthakhaṇḍa commences, Hemādri marshals the exact same 
1343 
materials as his predecessor (only incorporating a few additional verses from Pulastya’s 
teaching), in the service of making a very different sort of argument. 
Reading his source against the grain, Hemādri turns the inclusivism of the original text 
on its head. While not denying that people of little of means and who are intent on purging 
themselves of sin should undertake pilgrimage, the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s real focus is 
advocating for the substantial incorporation of well-heeled men of property and paragons of 
moral and ritual purity in the pilgrimage process, and for the participation onsite of specialist 
Brāhmaṇa ritualists as the overseers of the sacred fields. The flipside of this framework is that 
exemplars of ascetic virtues, who in the source texts are singled out as the pilgrim par- 
excellence, are denigrated or sidelined, and their values are treated as basically irrelevant to 
the ethos of pilgrimage. As much of this work is happening at the level of subversive 
commentarial glosses, it is worthwhile to begin by citing a bit of Pulastya’s discourse as found 
in Hemādri’s text. 
MBh: Making sacrifices with agniṣṭoma sacrifice and so forth, which involves a whole lot of money, a person does not obtain that same result as he does from going to the tīrthas. . . . Even having not burned the fires [through performing the Agnihotra], even by those who have just their own body [lit., with a single body] (ekātmabhiḥ) and are separated from their companions and who are devoid of assistance (asamhataiḥ), the ancestors are made to cross over and the grandfathers [are extracted] from the hells.1201 
Hemādri: Where the texts says “who have just their own body” (ekātmabhiḥ), [what is meant is] who is without a wife (patnīrahitaiḥ). Where the text says, “who are not well 
1201Throughout the present edition in progress of select passages from the theoretical portions of the Tīrthakhaṇḍa, references in the apparatus to “GV” refer to the Gaṅgāvākyāvalī of Viśvāsadevī, a work by a female scholar of Dharmaśāstra of the fifteenth century who was also a part of the royal family of Mithila. Much to my surprise, in searching for textual parallels to help in reconstructing the often damaged and disordered opening portion of Tīrthakhaṇḍa, it quickly became evident that though the ultimate subject of her treatise is rather different, in the opening chapter of her work, Viśvāsadevī has heavily relied on adapting the theoretical framework of the Tīrthakhaṇḍa as well as its citation patterns, occasionally altering the prose or excising more complicated śāstric arguments. Where Viśvāsadevī clearly understands the text far more cogently than the often incoherent transmission preserved in our manuscript, I adopt her readings. Mahābhārata as cited in the Tīrthakhaṇḍa: agniṣṭomādibhir yajñair iṣṭvā vipuladakṣiṇaiḥ / na tat phalam avāpnoti tīrthābhigamanena yat // . . . . anupoṣya trirātrāṇi tīrthāny anabhigamya ca / nārthanyūnopakaraṇair ekātmabhir asaṃhataiḥ // tāritāḥ pitaras tena narakāt prapitāmahāḥ / 
1344 
equipped,” [what is meant is those] who lack a Ṛgvedic and Sāmavedic priest and so forth. For this reason, the text says, “having not ignited the Agnihotra and forth.” Therefore, the fruit of each one of the four [rewards mentioned in the verses], namely, [from] the lighting of the fire for three nights, the going to the tīrthas, the giving of gold and cows is the absence of poverty. This is the sense.1202 
Through a series of sly recastings of key terms, Hemādri has already begun to adjust 
our expectations for what constitutes an ideal pilgrim. Displacing the root text’s conception of 
pilgrimage as a boon for the genuinely impoverished, who have neither servants nor access to 
the materials needed in performing ritual worship, he inscribes in their place a very different 
sort of person, namely, someone who is traveling without his wife and who does not have 
access to the complete retinue of Vedic ritualists that might assist him in his performances of 
Soma sacrifices. 
Having shifted the terms of the discussion so that this new context will alter the 
meaning of the materials he is about to import, Hemādri then briefly brings in a few verses 
from Pulastya’s original delineation of the characteristics of a pilgrim, once again at every step 
undercutting the simple denotative meaning of his sources where they do not suit his agenda. 
Likewise, MBh: The one of whom the two hands, the two feet and likewise the mind are restrained (susaṃyatam), and who has knowledge, austerity, and fame, enjoys the fruit of pilgrimage.1203 
Hemādri: Fame is in regard to good deeds. “Restraint of the hand” comes from leaving off of taking other people’s property (hastasamyamaḥ parasvagrahaṇanivṛtyā). “Restraint of the feet” means leaving off from going to countries/places that should not be gone to. Restraint of the mind means leaving off from contemptible desires. Vidyā

means knowledge of the qualities of the tīrthas and so forth. Tapas is characterized by dwelling and fasting at the tīrthas and so forth. . . .1204 
MBh: One who has left off from holding property, who is satisfied with whatever he has, is devoid of ego, and he enjoys the fruit of the tīrthas. He has no preferences, he is without support (nirālambha), he has not obtained food, he has conquered the senses. Freed from all social contact, he enjoys the fruit of the tīrthas. O king, one who is free from anger, who always speaks truth, is firm in vows, and who is similar to the self in all beings [who sees the same self in all beings], he enjoys the fruits of all tīrthas.1205 
Hemādri: Being devoid of holding property means immediately after one pilgrimage, then he proceeds directly to another pilgrimage. . . . Akalpaka means without fraud. “Without support” means being devoid of the conduct of acquiring money and so forth. “Freed from all social contact” (niḥsaṅga) means one who is not governed by attachment to people of his own gotra. . . . “Similar to the self means” he is passionate about the welfare of all downtrodden people. This is the meaning.1206 
In the Mahābhārata, Pulastya begins his discourse to Bhīṣma by calling upon the great 
warrior ascetic to listen with a one-pointed mind (ekāgramanasā), a rhetorical choice that 
prepares us for his definition of the sort of agent who will find success on pilgrimage. That this 
person— whether a householder or a professional renunciate—is a yogin in all but name is 
self-evident in the root text, for he has restrained his body and his mind, has performed 
austerities, does not own property, has cultivated neither attraction nor aversion to any 
particular thing, sees the self in all, has mastered his emotions and has no ego, dwells alone, 
consumes limited food, and observes vratas. For Pulastya, then, the pilgrim must embody a set 
of ascetic virtues to a very high degree precisely because the elaborate vidhi he prescribes will

1346 
demand that he performs harrowing austerities at some of the key stopping points in its very 
involved itinerary. 
In the service of advocating for a very different vision of the spirit of pilgrimage and 
what makes it efficacious, Hemādri systematically sets out to at once domesticate and 
ethicalize the defining features of a pilgrim. The figure that emerges out of his pen no longer 
has to have achieved mastery over the workings of the body and mind. He simply must meet a 
much lower set of prerequisites, being someone who does not steal, who does not stray into 
forbidden areas, and is not a prisoner of destructive obsessions. Instead of having acquired 
great learning and already performed intense austerities before attempting pilgrimage, he 
simply needs to observe such practices in situ as part of his performance of Purāṇic rituals, and 
to listen to and follow the right authorities. In place of abjuring the acquisition of property, 
having equanimity of vision, and withdrawing from the transactionalities of the social world— 
standard requirements for an ascetic—Hemādri simply requires the pilgrim to not hang around 
the pilgrimage site on holiday after he completes his observances and that he not commit fraud, 
engage in business dealings, or seek to advance the social position of his kin network while he 
is executing his religious duty. Finally, undercutting the famed teachings of the Bhagavad Gītā 
in a manner eerily akin to modern rereadings of scripture that substitute social justice concerns 
in place of spiritual attainment, Hemādri sets out to “secularize” the act of seeing the self in all 
beings, transmuting this into the pilgrim simply being “passionate about the welfare of all 
downtrodden people.” In essence, though from a position of privilege and wielding an almost 
unimaginable degree of institutional power what Hemādri is instigating is his very own sort of 
“quotidian revolution.” 
1347As we will see throughout this chapter, a highly selective curation of sources materials 
is a ubiquitous feature of the discourse in the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, which through exegetical 
sleight of hand imagines into being an ideological consensus not evident in the sources. 
Through such efforts, our author systematically reinvents the nature, context, and function of 
religious practice and the place which it occupies in the social world. At once one of the most 
tellingly egregious and relatively straightforward examples of Hemādri’s preferred sort of 
scholastic alchemy that transmutes the simple denotative sense of texts into something 
diametrically opposed to the obvious meaning makes it appearance just a few passages onward 
from where we have just left off in our readings. Hemādri has already delineated the traits of 
the pilgrim and he has begun to explain the universal procedure (sāmānyavidhi) for performing 
a pilgrimage—a subject to which we will return momentarily—when he is temporarily 
detained from fleshing out his major argument by a related tangent, the obviously pertinent 
question of “how should you travel when on going on pilgrimage?” On this matter, all of the 
sources he invokes are quite clear. For example, the Matsya Purāṇa says: 
But, for that man who goes by a vehicle (yāna), out of lordliness, greed, or delusion, all of [his efforts] will be fruitless. Therefore, one should avoid a vehicle.1207 
This is about as transparent a statement as one is likely to find in the Purāṇas. To any 
reasonable person, its message is self-evident. Traveling to pilgrimage sites by means of a 
vehicle is strictly prohibited— no exceptions. Or, so it would seem. Much in the manner of a 
Vedāntin reading their specific theology out from the Upaniṣads by singling out specific 
statements in the body of the text as the opening (upakrama) and closing (upasaṃhāra) of 
connected piece of discourse, the significance of which is elevated above the surrounding 
1207Matsya Purāṇa 106.7: aiśvaryalobhamohād vā gacched yānena yo naraḥ / niṣphalaṃ tasya tat sarvaṃ tasmād yānaṃ vivarjayet // 
1348 
materials, Hemādri resolves this apparent clash between the vision of pilgrimage he wishes to 
promote and the message conveyed by his sources by directing his reader’s attention to the 
larger rhetorical framework in Matsya Purāṇa within which this apparent prohibition is 
embedded. Several verses beforehand, the Matsya Purāṇa introduces this wider topic by 
offering us as a cautionary tale a certain man (naraḥ kvacit) who is intent on making pilgrimage 
to Prayāga (prayāgatīrthayātrārthī) while mounted on a bull (balīvardasamārūḍhaḥ). This 
unfortunate soul, we soon learn, after his own demise for his misdeeds will reap the fruit of 
having to dwell in the terrible hells (narake vasate ghore). Such a scoundrel is then contrasted 
with the right sort of person, who feeds the ancestors and gives philanthropy, especially to 
Brāhmaṇas. Through his actions, in the next life he will dwell in the celestial realms. It is only 
at this point, when the grammatical subject being referred to has already changed and the seeker 
after Prayāga is no longer relevant to the discussion, that the Matsya Purāṇa presents the verse 
offering a general prohibition on vehicle travel that we have just encountered. For Hemādri, 
however, this brief mention of Prayāga provides him with an expedient means for extracting 
himself out of a hermeneutical dead end. 
Hemādri: But this prohibition of the vehicle is only relevant to [the pilgrimage] to Prayāga, because such was stated in the Matsya Purāṇa. . . . Thus, the Kalpataru relates: 
“Travelling by cow, he is said to be a cow killer. If one goes on a horse, it is fruitless. Going by means of a man, then there is half the fruit, and it is four-fold if one does it on foot.” 
Hemādri: In this quote, “by feet and so forth,” on account of the non-concomitance of the ablative case [padbhyām] and so forth, there is [for the person going by foot] the fruit of the tīrthas along with extra merit; there is no fault in the usage [of these means of conveyance.] 
Thus, when [we recognize that] the prohibition on the vehicle is blocked (bādhita), [one realizes that] in the case of rain and heat, an umbrella bearer [is to be used] and in the 
1349 
case of the forest at night, a staff bearer would be the protector of the body. [Therefore], one should always go about with a vehicle.1208 
Through hermeneutical feats that run roughshod over the transparent denotative meaning 
of simple declarative statements, our author’s logic runs as follows. Having first demonstrated 
that simple prohibitions on the use of vehicles apply only to pilgrimage to Prayāga, our author 
repurposes the narrow possibility of permitting “a vehicle” under some circumstances, found 
only in one source, as providing sanction for a whole host of pilgrimage related perks. 
Umbrella bearers we are told, should accompany the pilgrim in the rainy season, armed guards 
should escort him when travelling through forest. Since all of these things entail the protection 
of the body—and what protects the body best is a vehicle—Hemādri arrives at the entirely 
counter intuitive conclusion that one must always go by vehicle when going on pilgrimage. 
Even better, as he will observe later on, instead of going through all this bother of travelling to 
sacred sites in the first place, the savvy entrepreneurial pilgrim might just as well pay someone 
else to go on his pilgrimage for him—for all of the merit apart from what your employee gains 
from washing himself will be transferred to the patron. 
“The one who goes for the sake of another obtains the sixteenth [part] of the merit.” 
H: The meaning is—this is the fruit of the tīrtha that belongs to him who goes by proxy. “On behalf of another” means by a proxy taking wages [to do his pilgrimage] and so forth.1209 
The hidden iconoclasm of Hemādri’s interpretive project—that under the guise of 
theorizing Hindu pilgrimage he is surreptitiously reinventing Hindu pilgrimage—comes into

sharp relief when we briefly juxtapose his mid-thirteenth century prescriptions with 
representations of Hindu pilgrimage from the early twelfth century composed within a similar 
geographical and social milieu. Indeed, the counterpoint provided here emerged within the 
court of the Kalyāṇa Cāḷukyas, whose sponsoring of the previously marginal Seuṇa Yādavas 
formed the necessary preconditions that made possible the emergence of the very institutional 
space in which Hemādri is operating. The text in question, you may have already realized, is 
the Vikramāṅkābhyudaya of Someśvara III, already explored at some length back in chapter 4. 
We have covered a lot of ground—conceptually as well quite literally—in the interim, so its 
perhaps worthwhile to highlight of few of the salient points from the earlier discussion. The 
Kalyāṇa Cāḷukya king Someśvara I is desperate to conceive a child. So, under the direction of 
a panel of learned Brāhmaṇas, he is directed to sponsor a series of ritual performances of the 
sixteen acts of mahādāna prescribed by the tradition of Dharmaśāstra, following the 
procedures outlined in the Matsya Purāṇa. The king does not perform these rituals himself, 
but has other people do the ritual acts for him by proxy. In part, it is precisely this decision, the 
text tells us, that causes the king to sire not a proper heir, but a sociopathic monster whose 
consciousness is dominated by rajas and tāmas. As you may remember, Someśvara I redeems 
himself and ensures the flourishing of his dynasty by going on pilgrimage. This is an activity 
that the kāvya seems to understand as falling outside the realm of Brāhmaṇical Dharmaśāstra 
and animated by a fundamentally antithetical ethos. Both rhetorically and conceptually, the 
text repeatedly orients its intended readers to this fundamental difference between the two 
domains of religious praxis by framing key moments in Someśvara I’s pilgrimage as 
repudiations of types of choices and values that were reflected in the king’s behavior during 
1351 
the mahādāna rites.1210 It emphatically insists on two dichotomies in particular. First, that 
while during the disastrous philanthropic rite ostensibly honoring Śiva, the king “worshipped” 
through proxy amidst a great retinue, he had to perform the far more effective pilgrimage with 
his very own two bare feet, bereft of retinue as well resources, in simple solitude. Secondly, 
while the first rituals were not merely elaborate but genuinely enjoyable affairs where the king 
was repeatedly indulged and his senses satisfied, in contrast, both enroute to Srisailam and 
while keeping the company of the god, Someśvara I observed intense physical austerities to an 
extent virtually unknown in the life of a householder.1211 Through deliberately inflicting 
suffering and pain on his own body, the Cāḷukya king purified his body and his mind, 
completely one-pointed, and as the text quite plainly states, it was precisely this sort of practice 
1210Under the direction of Brāhmaṇas, Someśvara I oversees the worship (Someśvara, Vikramāṅkābhyudaya, pg. 33): tatas tanayalābhakāmo ’nukūlavartinyā mahādevyā saha sarvakāmadasya mahādevasya caraṇārādhanavidhim ārabdhavān / pratidivasaṃ ca pañcāmṛtaparipūrṇasauvarṇakalaśasahasrair ajasram abhiṣekaṃ bhavasya kārayāmāsa / apārakarpūrasugandhicandanasāndrakuṅkumadravair vilepanam akārayat / vividhaparimalabahalakusumair vicitrakanakakamalair vihitadhūpadīpanaivedyagītavādyaiś ca pūjām akarot / “Then, desiring to obtain a son, accompanied by his queen who was in favorable mood, he began the procedure for the worshipping of the feet of Mahādeva, which bestows all desires. And every day, with a thousand golden kalaśas filled with the five nectars, he had performed (kārayāmāsa) the ceaseless abhiṣeka of Śiva. He caused to be done (akāryata) the anointing with streams of kuṃkuṃ, moist kuṃkuṃ, the fragrant sandal paste, camphors that are unparalleled. He “did” the pūja with lots of flowers that have various sorts of fragrances, with many kinds of golden lotuses, with the required instrumental music, with singing, with lamps, with naivedya, and with dhūpa.” 
At Śrīśaila, Someśvara I worships the Lord himself (Someśvara, Vikramāṅkābhyudaya, pg. 43–44): tataḥ prabhṛti pratidinaṃ pātālagaṅgāsalilaparipūritaiś cāmīkaracārukalaśair bhagavantaṃ trilocanaṃ snapayāmbabhūva / tadanu haricandanacandanaghanasāramārga-dravair anulilimpa / tato vividhavihitasugandhikusumaviracitavicitra-mālyapañcopacārasubhagāṃ pūjāṃ cakāra / tathā pratibhaṭanarapatiśiraḥkirīṭakoṭitāḍananiratābhyām api svabhāvakomalābhyāṃ caraṇābhyām eva santataṃ virūpākṣaṃ pradakṣinīcakre / “From that moment on, every day, he bathed the three eyed lord with beautiful gold kalaśas, which were filled with water from the subterranean Gaṅgā. After that, he smeared the Lord with the essences of deer musk, camphor, sandal paste, and yellow sandal paste. And then, he performed a pūjā that was very auspicious with the five facilitating practices, with many types of flowers garlands that were fashioned with fragrant flowers of many sorts, as was enjoined. Likewise, he performed ceaseless circumambulation of Virūpākṣa with his own two feet which, even though they had been engaged in the striking of crores of the crowns on the heads of adversarial kings, were tender by their very nature.” 1211Someśvara, Vikramāṅkābhyudaya, pg. 43–44: “Although he was always made for endless pleasures, because of his being extremely sattvic, he subsisted solely on bulbs, roots, and water. Having taken up the rule of celibacy, he passed the nights/rid himself of women on a marriage bed made of stone. What more is there to say? Practicing that kind of tapas, exceedingly extreme; that which causes adversity to the senses, which drives away the sense objects; that which is the obstructer of momentary pleasures; that which is the impeder of obstacles; that which binds the modifications of the mind, that which leads astray the royal play. . . . austerity of a sort never seen before or heard of previously, he passed the time for an exceedingly long while.” 
1352 
that caused the Lord, speaking directly to his devotee, to grant him a boon in the form of the 
child that would become Vikramāditya VI. This is of course the very regent whose fifty-year 
reign did so much to define the discursive and institutional worlds into which Hemādri was 
born and that he would do so much to deconstruct. 
Reconsidering the narrative illustrations of pilgrimage practice in the twelfth-century 
Vikramāṅkābhyudaya in light of prescriptions in the thirteenth-century Caturvargacintāmaṇi, 
we are met with a curious irony. In spite of the fact that Someśvara III was skeptical if not 
downright hostile, at least as it related to the realm of religious ritual, towards the tradition of 
Dharmaśāstra as well as its Purāṇic imitators of the sort we find in the Matsya Purāṇa, and 
while Hemādri is the discourse’s most strident champion, it is actually the Cāḷukya king and 
not our Dharmaśāstrin polymath whose vision of pilgrimage proves to be most faithful to the 
ethos we find outlined in the very Purāṇic proof texts on top of which the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s Tīrthakhaṇḍa assembles its own arguments. Amusingly, this 
consonance is particularly striking when it comes to the passages that Hemādri has extracted 
from the Matsya Purāṇa. In any case, a plurality of the exact passages that Hemādri invokes, 
to say nothing of the wider context from which those passages were extracted, perceive 
pilgrimage as a domain animated by precisely the sort of ascetic ethos and sensibility, 
emphasizing clarity of intention, one-pointed focus, and above all else, and sustained 
individual effort, that Hemādri sets out to elide through his commentarial practice. Hemādri’s 
explicit project of consolidating and synthesizing a preexisting body of knowledge provides 
him with cover for what in actuality seems to be a radical—and at the time quite eccentric— 
wholesale reinvention of tradition. 
1353 
Indeed, the more thoroughly and carefully one reads the methodological portions of 
the Tīrthakhaṇḍa in particular, the more evident it becomes that the virtual absence of textual 
precedents for the type of interpretive work on display in Hemādri’s text within our surviving 
sources is not in fact a reflection of ignorance on the part of modern scholars of Dharmaśāstra. 
Nor can it simply be accounted for by assuming that, apart from Lakṣmīdhara, we simply lack 
access to an earlier lost tradition of dharmanibandha writers—well known to Hemādri—who 
come down to us only in form of a list names embedded in Lakṣmīdhara’s praśastis honoring 
his predecessors.1212 Such assumptions simply do not stand in light of how Hemādri handles 
his sources. With great consistency, when Hemādri asserts a doctrinal stance and then invokes 
the authority of “all the nibandhakāras” (sometimes specifically mentioning the Mitākṣara 
author and Lakṣmīdhara), or when he engages polemically with the “position” of a specific 
Dharmaśāstra author, the sources he invokes are only tangentially related to the specific topic 
at hand. Moreover, we have strong indications that the older discussions in question were not 
actually found in texts that were invested in exploring the topic of tīrthayātrā. 
Making sense of Hemādri’s argument requires us to proceed slowly and methodically. 
Let us see how he starts to develop his case: 
1212As presented in the grantha praśasti contained within the Brahmacārikāṇḍa of Kṛtyakalpataru, the works listed run as follows: The oldest work is the Kalpavṛkṣa. Lakṣmīdhara then speaks in sequence of the Mahārṇava, the Kāmadhenu, and the Ratnamālā, all of whose authors he does not mention. See the Brahmacārikāṇḍa, page 3. The Japanese scholar Ryoshu Kouda has located two fragmentary but substantial manuscripts containing portions of the Kṛtyakāmadhenu of Gopāla. These are related to the Dāna and Śrāddha divisions, with the former topic being handled quite tersely. On the basis of the text preserved therein, which he has been able to determine that this work was also composed in Varanasi for Lakṣmīdhara’s patron Govindacandra. The two scholars, whose works both reflect the casual Vaiṣṇavism of the court in which they served, thus seem to have been contemporaries. This dynamic suggests that the Ratnamālā, which Lakṣmīdhara understands as a response to the Kāmadhenu, was also composed around the same time in a similar milieu. This leaves us with potentially two dharmanibandha texts, the Mahārṇava and Kalpavṛkṣa, which could possibly have been produced before the twelfth century and outside of the eastern portion of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Though Kouda’s work is published in Japanese, a language I do not read, his articles reproduce useful facsimiles of the folios while also transcribing colophons and key portions. See, for example: Ryoshu Kouda, (2015) “Gopāla cho Kṛtyakāmadhenu no baiyō shahon (kami),” Hasegawa bukkyō bunka kenkyujo nenpō 39 (2015): 1–61 (230–170). 
1354 
[Identified by Viśvāsadevī as Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa]: “Whoever should go to the tīrtha pilgrimage, his fasts completed, being previously restrained (susamyata) to his own house, being zealous for a long time, he should worship Gaṇeśa, genuflecting with bhakti. The intelligent one should worship the gods, the ancestors, the Brāhmaṇas and also the sādhus. He should propitiate the fierce ancestors/the Brāhmaṇas, with effort, and with wealth, according to his ability. Having returned again and again, then again he should worship the gods, ancestors, and Brāhmaṇas. One who is acting in this way obtains that fruit stated to be from the tirtha. Of that there is no doubt.”1213 
Hemādri: On the part beginning susaṃyata—On the previous day, the one who has performed the niyama that is exclusive devotion and so forth, who fasted on the day after that, then, having worshipped Gaṇeśa, the grahas, and one’s own chosen deity, having done a pārvaṇa offering, one should worship the Brāhmaṇas. 
And this pārvaṇa has ghee as its principal substance (ghṛtamukhyadravyaka) based on this authoritative statement from the Bhaviṣya Purāṇa.1214 
Up until this point in the chapter, though his interpretations have often been quite 
different, Hemādri has been dutifully reproducing Lakṣmīdhara’s main citations, for the most 
part in the exact same order. This passage from the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, which replaces some 
citations from the Devī Purāṇa in Lakṣmīdhara’s original, offers us his first extended choice 
of a new proof text. Taken in isolation, all that the passage seems to offer on its own is an 
extremely generic invocation of the practice of tīrthayātrā. It suggests that when you go on 
pilgrimage, especially if you have not been on one for a long time, you should make a point of 
honoring Gaṇeśa when you first get there and then eventually get around to feeding the 
ancestors, the sadhus, and the Brāhmaṇas. What Hemādri does with this rather banal material, 
for what seems to be the first time in the scholastic discourse, is he derives from it a formalized 
1213All of our sources transmit these verses in metrically damaged forms. Emendations have been given that begin to restore meter and sense. Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Tīrthakhaṇḍa: tathā— yo yaḥ kaści[t] tīrthayātrā[ṃ] tu gacchet susaṃyataḥ / [sa] ca pūrvaṃ gṛheṣu [KK. svagṛheṣu GV: gṛhe sve] // kṛtopavāsaḥ śucirapramattaḥ sampūjayed bhaktinam[r]o gaṇeśaṃ / devān pit[ṝ]n brāhmaṇ[ā]ṃś caiva sādhūn dhīmān pit[ṝ]n vittaśaktyā prayatnāt // pratyāgataś cāpi punas tathaiva [KK. tathā punas tu] devān pit[ṝ]n brāhmaṇān pūjayec ca / [t]aṃ kurvatas tasya tīrthād ya[d]uktaṃ phalaṃ [tu] syān nātra samdeham[sic] asti // 1214Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Tīrthakhaṇḍa: susaṃyata iti pūrvadine kṛtaikabhaktyādiniyamaḥ taduttaradinopavāsaḥ gaṇeśaṃ grahāṇi niṣṭadevatāṃ ca sampūjya pārvaṇaṃ ca kṛtvā brāhmaṇān pūjayet / idaṃ ca p[ā]rv[a]ṇaṃ ghṛtamukhyadravyakaṃ, bhaviṣyatpurāṇavacanāt / gacchen deśāntaraṃ rājan śrāddhaṃ kṛtvā tu sarpiṣā // yātrārtham iti ta[t] proktaṃ praveśe ca na saṃsayaḥ // iti / 
1355 
ritual injunction and procedure. This is to say, he treats the Purāṇic passage as if it contains not 
merely a ritual injunction, but a nested series of dependent procedures. As we will see, as he 
continues to elaborate, this begins with the observation of the niyama that is bhakti, and ends 
on the last day with a veneration in sequence of Gaṇeśa, the grahas, and one’s own chosen 
deity, the making of a pārvaṇa offering (a type of śrāddha sacrifice) and the feeding of 
Brāhmaṇas. We should note that of these activities, only the initial display of bhakti, the 
veneration of Gaṇeśa, and the feeding Brāhmaṇas has actually been mentioned by the root text. 
Not only has Hemādri’s list interpolated in these other elements, but it is noticeably silent about 
elements actually present in his sources, such as the separate veneration of sādhus. What’s 
more, it has imposed from without a logical, sequential and hierarchical relationship between 
these elements nowhere in evidence in the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa itself, even supplying in from 
an entirely unrelated source the specification—entirely absent from his proof text—that the 
performance of the pārvaṇa ritual “has ghee as its principal substance 
(ghṛtamukhyadravyaka).” 
It is our author’s use of this technical language, “the main ingredient” 
(mukhyadravyaka) embedded within an awkward unnatural collocation, that provides us with 
our first indication what exactly Hemādri is really up to, for this term of art and style of 
discourse is unmistakably derived from the tradition of the Mīmāṃsā exegetes. As will soon 
become apparent, Hemādri is going to “derive” a universal procedure for performing 
pilgrimage from an intertextual reading of a range of previously logically discrete Purāṇic 
sources, a task he will accomplish by reading the text of these Purāṇas as if they were emerging 
from different śākhās of the Veda, whose procedures have to be reconciled. Succinctly, within 
1356 
totally new textual environs, Hemādri is acting as if he were a Prābhākara Mīmāṃsaka 
interpreting the Veda. 
What exactly does this entail? In the next chapter, we will explore in some detail 
Hemādri’s own articulation of this model as presented in the Śrāddhakalpa, which will prove 
integral to his defense of the authoritativeness of Smṛti and Purāṇa. For the moment, however, 
since it is basically impossible to understand what Hemādri is up to as an internally coherent 
intellectual project without some background, a bit of orientation is needed.1215 To offer a 
simple introduction to this very complex issue, following Jaimini’s second sūtra on codanā, 
all Mīmāṃsakas read through the Veda in search of injunctive statements—commands that 
there is something that has to be done. They identify these statements on the basis of the 
presence or absence of certain verbal forms (optative liṅ, imperative loṭ, Vedic subjunctive leṭ, 
and gerundive tavya as well as the present indicative under some special cases) that have an 
injunctive force. The iconic example, first mentioned by Śabara in his commentary on Jaimini 
but invoked throughout the literature is “svargakāmo yajetā,” which literally means the “one 
desiring heaven should sacrifice.” In his linguistic analysis of this statement, Śabara 
summarizes this injunctive phrase as yāgena svargo bhavati, literally “heaven comes into being 
by means of the sacrifice.” This reframing—which becomes standard practice for thinking with 
an injunction—enables the exegete to query every ritual injunction by means of a grammatical 
analysis so that it provides answers to three questions—1) what do you have to do, 2) what is 
the instrument you use to do your task, and 3) how, specifically, can the task be accomplished. 
1215In this regard, depending on the degree of interest, the reader is directed to consult: Lawrence McCrea, “The Hierarchical Organization of Language in Mīmāṃsā Interpretive Theory,” Journal of Indian philosophy 28, no. 5–6 (2000): 429–459; Elisa Freschi, Duty, Language and Exegesis in Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā: Including an Edition and Translation of Rāmānujācārya’s Tantrarahasya, Śāstraprameyapariccheda (Leiden: Brill, 2012); Kei Kataoka, Kumārila on Truth, Omniscience, and Killing: An Annotated Translation of Mimamsa-Slokavarttika ad 1.1.2 (Codanasutra) (Vienna: Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 2011). 
1357In this case, from a Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā perspective, “what you are doing” is bringing heaven into 
being, the ritual you are performing is the instrument, and the instructions for doing the task 
are the procedures that make up that ritual. This mode of analysis requires introducing a new 
term—the verb of being, bhavati—and with it a new concept, the idea of bhāvanā—bringing 
into being. For the Bhāṭṭa school of Mīmāṃsā, the idea is then that the injunctive verbal root 
in the verb conveys that the sacrifice somehow brings into being—by means of bhāvanā—a 
unprecedented (apūrva) state of affairs, which in this case is heaven. Succinctly, the one who 
desired heaven would not have attained heaven before he performed the ritual. By performing 
the ritual, at some point in the future, heaven will be attained. Kumārila, the founding figure 
of the Bhāṭṭa school, refines this model, proposing that bhāvanā actually works to bring two 
things into being, on the one hand causing “bringing into being” itself to happen (linguistic 
bhāvanā) and on the other hand bringing into being specific objects or elements in the ritual 
(arthabhāvanā), in this case heaven. 
What is important for our purposes is that the Prābhākara Mīmāṃsakas, figures like 
Śālikanātha Miśra, object to this whole “bhāvanā” model. Asserting an even more staunchly 
empiricist stance than their Bhāṭṭa rivals, they reject linguistic bhāvanā as a fantasy with no 
empirical referent that needlessly complicates our understanding. Instead, they argue, just as 
Hemādri is about to do, that normative verbal suffixes just provide us with information about 
the grammatical number (singular, plural, etc.) and temporal status of the agent and objects in 
a textual passage. Effectively their position is that, unlike with the Bhāṭṭas, Mīmāṃsā does not 
need to consider the intentionality or subjectivity at all of the ritual agent, especially not to the 
extent of rethinking our philosophy of language (in this regard they are very much not like 
Hemādri, who will take his inspiration in this domain from the emergent tradition of the new 
1358 
logic). They suggest we should shift our focus from trying to understand how the injunction 
impels the sacrificer to act and instead center our investigation on the bare fact that the agent 
is compelled to act and then investigate the nature of the action that is to be done. In short, 
what the Prābhākara tradition does is re-extend what Francis Clooney has called the 
decentering of the human.1216 When this is done, Mīmāṃsā becomes once again primarily 
about thinking through the local relationships between the discrete material elements in a ritual, 
especially theorizing the transference of ritual details from the archetype (prakṛti) for a ritual 
to its ectype (vikṛti), as well as context-specific attempts at deploying those rules in particular 
ritual settings. And as it turns out, these are precisely the two intellectual practices that 
dominate the Caturvargacintāmaṇi. 
The Prābhākaras propose that what is apūrva in any given moment, in the sense of 
expected and not yet manifest, is not some transcendent result but the specific ritual detail that 
is needed in that given moment. This is why when the Prābhākara tradition glosses 
“svargakāmo yajetā,” it does so as “darśapūrṇamāsyayāgena svargam bhāvayet.” Whereas a 
Bhāṭṭa would understand this as bringing into being heaven by means of the specified sacrifice 
and fixating on thinking about how that bringing into being works, the Prābhākara instead 
provides us with an analytical matrix that, through proper reading, enables one to eventually 
locate that for performing this particular sacrifice, rice is the ingredient of the moment 
(mukhyadravya). In the metalanguage of the Prābhākaras, because rice will “accomplish the 
role of what is desired” it is the śeṣa, and thus we need to produce a new sentence, through 
viniyoga, that preliminarily reframes the above as “one should bring the X sacrifice into being 
by means of rice,” and ultimately as “he should bring about the result through six rites that 
1216Francis Clooney, Thinking Ritually: Rediscovering the Pūrva Mīmāṃsā of Jaimini (Vienna: De Nobili Research Library, 1990). 
1359 
make up the full and new moon sacrifices using specific ingredients in particular relationship 
with various mantras, and so forth.” Dharma, in this formulation, entails the grasping 
(grahāka) of the śeṣa, constituting a heap of ritual items and steps situated in the proper 
context. It is this bundle of purely empirical elements that the tradition defines as “what you 
have to do,” the itikartavyatā. 
Now, as we have just started to see, this sort of exegetical work is precisely one of the 
main projects that Hemādri keeps returning to throughout the Caturvargacintāmaṇi. As 
Hemādri will ultimately argue, because they find no explicit mention in the Vedic texts, all of 
the rituals discussed in the Caturvargacintāmaṇi fall under the category of ectypal (vikṛti) 
rituals. Like all such rituals in the Vedas, this means that we cannot simply consult a single 
source that discusses them in full—or even a single ritual canon—because such resources do 
not exist. Instead, just as Hemādri does throughout the CVC, the “standard” or universal form 
of a ritual, nowhere in evidence in the source texts, must be arrived at analytically through the 
application of metarules, reconciling apparent contradictions within and among texts, ordering 
the relative priority of different statements within a corpus, and then documenting some of the 
transformations applied to the common ritual procedure in different contexts and 
circumstances. 
In this regard at least, much of Hemādri’s project would seem to be iconically 
Mīmāṃsaka. Where our author diverges enormously from his predecessors is in his choice of 
materials, for nearly all of Mīmāṃsā had proposed that their mode of reading, beyond a theory 
of the sentence, explicitly does not apply to non-Vedic texts—Vedānta even suggests it is 
inadmissible when it comes to the Upaniṣads—and that it was particularly inappropriate in 
treating the Purāṇas. There are many reasons why this would have been the case, starting from 
1360 
the fact that most of the Purāṇas offer what Mīmāṃsā would label arthavāda, things such as 
stories that neither offer an injunction nor clarify ritual details. Certainly, one significant factor 
is that there was considerable doubt among intellectuals and theologians, even among those 
who valued Purāṇas, about whether or not they were all equally authoritative as well as if they 
formed a unitary textual corpus with a singular intention, essential preconditions for reading 
them intertextually. The dissonance between Vedic and Purāṇic textuality and thus between 
the proper hermeneutics for treating the texts for most readers seemed self-evident. After all, 
Mīmāṃsā had famously grounded the authority of the Veda on its apauruṣeyatva—its being a 
text without an author—whereas Purāṇas are explicitly compiled works, different portions of 
which are “authored” or spoken by distinctive gods. 
For Hemādri, however, for reasons that he will make plain in the next chapter of this 
thesis, these discrepancies seem not to have been problematic. Thus, he habitually reads the 
Purāṇic corpus as a whole as if the details not found in passages in one work—such as the 
Brahmāṇḍa—can be readily supplied from another that seemingly addresses similar subjects. 
Much to the modern reader’s annoyance, he even does this when the connections between the 
two sources are hardly self-evident. Take for example, the following passage, which resumes 
immediately from the place where we left off in his discourse: 
Hemādri: And this pārvaṇa has ghee as its principal substance (ghṛtamukhyadravyaka) based on this authoritative statement from the Bhaviṣya Purāṇa: 
Bhaviṣya Purāṇa: The king, having done the śrāddha [rite] with ghee (sarpiṣā), should go to another country; this is stated to be for the sake of yātrā in regard to “entry,” there is no doubt. 
Hemādri: Some people say this [passage] is related to bestowing military victory, but, that is wrong. Because, there is a greater hermeneutical probability [lit. interpretive 
1361 
lightness] of construing [the word] upavāsa [in the verse] in the sense of a fast (upavāsa), because of this usage being relevant to the present context.1217 
Since the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa’s bland and basically detail poor summary of tīrthayātrā 
does not supply us with enough information to actually perform the key acts involved in 
tīrthayātrā, Hemādri next goes searching elsewhere in the Purāṇas. Ultimately, he locates a 
statement in the Bhaviṣya Purāṇa that also contains a brief reference to yātrā, which specifies 
that in śrāddha rites, ghee should be used as the main element. This statement, however, is of 
dubious relevance, for the agent it specifies is not a pilgrim but a king, and the yātrā of which 
it speaks offers no indication that it is fact a pilgrimage. Sanskrit is of course a polysemantic 
language in general, and yātrā can refer to many types of journeys. The fact that the king is the 
probable agent and that the śrāddha rite precedes “going to another country,” however, suggest 
that the Bhaviṣya Purāṇa has in mind a very specific and conceptually unrelated context—that 
in fact the yātrā under discussion is the war processional. The division on yātrābheda, for 
example, in the Mānasollāsa of Someśvara III offers us a taxonomy of different types of yātrās, 
all of them in fact preparations for invading enemy kingdoms, organized according to 
astrological and prognosticatory factors and prefaced by a range of rituals, some of which do 
in fact involve the king offering ghee. 
Hemādri is quick to try to rebut such suggestions, a task he carries out by invoking 
Mīmāṃsā-derived reading strategies pertaining to the relative authoritativeness and priority of 
different approaches for determining the precise meaning of key terms of art in the text and 
their logical relationship to each other. His effort here however reads as particularly forced. 
His invocation of the term “upavāsa” in the sense of fast as clarifying the intended context for 
1217Hemādri, Tīrthakhaṇḍa: idaṃ ca p[ā]rv[a]ṇaṃ ghṛtamukhyadravyakaṃ, bhaviṣyatpurāṇavacanāt / gacchen deśāntaraṃ rājan śrāddhaṃ kṛtvā tu sarpiṣā // yātrārtham iti ta[t] proktaṃ praveśe ca na saṃsayaḥ // iti idam ābhyudāyakam iti tu kecit / tan na, prakṛtitvenopāsveti lāghavā[t] / 
1362 
the text of the Bhaviṣya Purāṇa’s use of yātrā, runs aground of the simple fact that the word 
upavāsa does not actually appear anywhere in the portion of the Bhaviṣya which he has cited. 
It is in fact being supplied from the earlier quotation in the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, which had 
characterized the prospective pilgrim as one whose fast has been completed (kṛtopavāsaḥ). In 
essence, Hemādri’s reading is only meaningful at all if we come to the table having already 
presupposed the intertextual dependence of all of the Purāṇas, that they are a unified corpus 
with a singular focus that can be read as if they are all providing us with different 
complementary parts to the same puzzle. 
That Hemādri’s strained readings and usage of his sources are a sui generis phenomenon, 
predicated on the fact that he lacks any substantive antecedents in the tradition who are trying 
to make his same arguments, is perhaps most compellingly exemplified in a series of connected 
portions of his discourse embedded within the same delineation of the universal procedure for 
pilgrimage and its theoretical foundations that we have just exploring. As we will see 
momentarily, Hemādri frames much of this section of his text as a reply to a series of stances 
ascribed to a certain Dharmaśāstrin named Gaṇeśvaramiśra. This is a figure of considerable 
obscurity, but considering that determining the actual the nature of his contributions is quite 
pertinent to evaluating Hemādri’s own use of his materials, it is worth pausing for a moment 
to survey what little we can know about him. 
In a magisterial survey of the early history of eastern Dharmaśāstra traditions 
completed in 1915, Rai Monmohan Chakravarti Bahadur dedicates four sentences to 
Gaṇeśvaramiśra, suggesting his contributions are known to us only on the basis of citations 
found in four later works of eastern Dharmaśāstra.1218 On the basis of the earliest of these— 
1218M. Chakravarti, “Contributions to the History of Smṛti in Bengal and Mithila,” Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, New Series 11 (1915): 311–75, 377–406. 
1363 
the Smṛtisāra—Bahadur proposes that Gaṇeśvaramiśra probably lived in Mithila prior to the 
fourteenth century and that he wrote a work on ācāra. In his History of Dharmaśāstra, without 
acknowledging the extent of his debt to his Bengali predecessor, Panduranga Kane helpfully 
informs us while summarizing the Smṛtisāra of Harinātha—in which Gaṇeśvaramiśra is cited 
several times—that the work in question dealt with the sixteen saṃskāras, death rites, śrāddha 
and purification.1219 Kane (1962, pg. 372) also mentions another possibly related manuscript 
that covered many of the titles of law. A number of decades later, Ludo Rocher1220 also ascribes 
to Gaṇeśvaramiśra a text on jurisprudence—entitled the Vyavahārataraṅga—quite possibly 
the same source noticed in passing by Kane, briefly reconstructing Gaṇeśvara’s position on the 
subject of vākpāruṣya—abusive speech—as it is remembered by later commentators. While 
Rocher’s parenthetical note has seemingly been ignored, it is Kane’s position that has been 
taken as canonical by later historians of the discipline. This is unfortunate, as Kane in his 
analysis rather unhelpfully proceeds to assert, seemingly based on the shared name Gaṇeśvara, 
that “it appears extremely probable” that the Gaṇeśvaramiśra under discussion is the same 
figure as Gaṇeśvara Ṭhakkura, the uncle of the famous Caṇḍeśvara Ṭhakkura, author of the 
Smṛtiratnākara, and that he must have been writing between 1275–1310 CE. Kane’s 
supposition is of course unambiguously refuted by the presence of numerous references to 
Miśra within the circa 1260 CE Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s Tīrthakhaṇḍa. 
Debunking this association has enormous relevance for our own investigation, 
precisely because the fourteenth-century Gaṇeśvara Ṭhakkura is remembered primarily for his 
1219Pandurang Vaman Kane, History of Dharmasastra (Ancient and Mediæval Religious and Civil Law in India), Vol. 1 (Pune: Bhandakar Oriental Research Institute, 1962). 1220Ludo Rocher, “The Definitions of Vākpāruṣya,” Studies in Hindu Law and Dharmaśāstra, ed. Donald Davis (New York: Anthem Press, 2012), 513–25. Gaṇeśvaramiśra is discussed on pg. 516–17. Rocher, one might note, unlike Kane, correctly assigns Miśra to a period prior to the fourteenth century of the Common Era. 
1364 
now fragmentary Sugatisopāna, a work that combs through the Purāṇas in the service of 
crafting a soteriologically-oriented Dharmaśāstra. The work is unpublished, but on the basis of 
what has been cited from it in manuscript, Gaṇeśvara Ṭhakkura’s work may well represent one 
of the earliest surviving scholastic responses to the intellectual project of the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi. Had the two Gaṇeśvaras been identical, as Kane had assumed, this may 
well have been indicative that Hemādri’s treatment of Tīrtha (and much else besides) was 
indeed dependent on an earlier lost tradition of Dharmaśāstra commentary. As we are about to 
see though, based on the internal evidence from within Hemādri’s own text, in contrast, far 
from combing through the Purāṇas in search of “a bridge to heaven,” within his own writings, 
the elder Gaṇeśvaramiśra’s incidental engagement with the theology of place was confined to 
some stray passages that discuss the relevance of Prayāga and Gayā to the performance of 
śrāddha rituals. Thus, there is every indication that it is Hemādri himself, appropriating 
Gaṇeśvara’s materials, and not some lost predecessor, who for the first time in the scholastic 
tradition is systematically theorizing tīrthayātrā in universal terms. Making sense of Hemādri’s 
argument requires us to proceed slowly and methodically. Let us see how he starts to develop 
his case: Hemādri: Gaṇeśvaramiśra and the other say thus: on the day of the fast, also there is the [making] of a bald head. In Prayāga, during the tīrthayātrā, due to the separation from the mother and the father, one should perform the shaving such that he becomes bald.1221 
According to the statements of the Smṛtisamuccaya, Śaṅkhalikhita and Viṣṇu, when one is intent on going to the tīrtha (tīrthagamane cikīrṣite)—wearing the garb of a renunciate—in the beginning there is shaving, this is the meaning. And immediately after the śrāddha, there is the resolution to go. Then, there is the bearing of the garb [of the renunciate]. 
That is stated in the Vāyu Purāṇa: 
1221Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Tīrthakhaṇḍa: gaṇeśvaramiśrādayo ’py evaṃ upavāsadine mu[ṇḍ]am api prayāge tīrthayātrāyāṃ pitṛmāt[ṛ]viyogataḥ [vapa]n[a]ṃ] kuryād [ya]thā [s]a vika[co] bhaved iti / 
1365 
Vāyu Purāṇa: If one is prepared to go to Gayā, having done the śrāddha according to injunction, having donned the garb of an ascetic, having performed the circumambulation of the village, having then gone to another village, then, there is the eating of the remains from the śrāddha. Then, every day that he should go, without receiving alms, at each step along the way there would be the fruit of the Aśvamedha on the part of the one going to Gayā.1222 
Essentially, what Hemādri has accomplished here is a conflation of a whole range of 
previously discrete, context-specific practices that have their origins in distinctive sources. By 
presuming that these materials have a shared conceptual context—prakaraṇa, in the language 
of Mīmāṃsā, which is indicated, as we will see in the next chapter, by the presence of shared 
terms of art—having knit them altogether, our author then applies himself to the herculean task 
of trying to iron out all of the apparent contradictions so that this becomes a single, 
noncontradictory, and connected discourse. What such an approach elides is that the referents 
in situ in each of these discussions were originally quite different. 
Gaṇeśvaramiśra it seems was not really talking about pilgrimage at all, at least as we 
understand it. Instead, the actual subject of his inquiry is into the precise procedure to be 
followed by the eldest son in a family immediately following the cremation of his parents. This 
is a process that famously begins, just as it does today, with the mourner having his head 
shaved, and generally entails the making of a śrāddha offering at either Prayāga or Gayā. These 
features of the discourse explain why, even in Hemādri’s summary, Gaṇeśvara speaks of 
becoming bald as being motivated by “separation from the mother and father” 
(pitṛmātraviyogataḥ). And while we do not know precisely what was in the recension of 
1222Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Tīrthakhaṇḍa: smṛtisamuccayalikhitaviṣṇuvacanāt kārpatīveṣeṇa tīrthagamane cikīrṣit[e] ādau [vapanam] ity arthaḥ / śrāddhāntaram ca gamanasamkalpas, tato veṣadhāraṇaṃ / taduktaṃ vāyupurāṇe— uddyataś c[e]d gayāṃ gaṃtu[ṃ] śrāddhaṃ kṛtvā vidhānataḥ vidhāya kārpatīveṣaṃ [GV: kārpataṃ veṣaṃ] kṛtvā grāmaṃ pradakṣiṇaṃ tato grāmāntaraṃ gatvā śrāddhaśeṣasya bhojanaṃ / tataḥ pratidinaṃ [GV: pradakṣiṇaṃ] gacchet pratigrahavivarjitaḥ / pade pade ‘śvamedhasya syāt phalaṃ gacchato gayā[m] / 
1366 
Śaṅkha available to our author, elsewhere in the Caturvargacintāmaṇi Hemādri draws upon a 
version of Likhitasmṛti whose readings are very close to that of the published edition.1223 At 
least as printed, Likhita contains zero references to tīrthayātrā, or any other euphemism to that 
effect. Its only references to the shaving of the head appear in verses fifteen to twenty, where 
the subject under discussion once again is the specific śrāddha one is to perform following the 
death of one’s mother or father, a procedure that here as well entails the complete shaving of 
the head even before one offers the three-fold piṇḍa. For our purposes, what is important is 
that in each of these cases, what is under discussion is a highly particularized naimittika ritual. 
In this exact form it is to be observed only one or two times in a single lifetime. In other words, 
this is hardly the sort of activity that would be likely to form the template for “the general ritual 
procedure” governing any sort of pilgrim venturing towards any sacred place. In fact, even 
within the archive available to us roughly corresponding to Hemādri’s chosen sources, most of 
the highly specific details invoked by our author are uniquely associated with this kind of 
śrāddha rite. In Likhita, for instance, the other forms of śrāddha do not entail any act of head 
shaving at all. 
The source that Hemādri invokes to complement this evidence—a passage from the 
Vāyu Purāṇa, adds even further complications. Hemādri is invested in this proof text because 
unlike the other parts of his archive, which were either maddeningly vague or, while outlining 
a highly specific practice inconveniently were not explicitly related to tīrthayātrā, the Vāyu 
Purāṇa explicitly mentions an injunction and then actually offers us some of the concrete steps 
that make up the procedure. Even this text, however, requires some tweaking if one is to make 
it appear to be perfectly on topic. Instead of taking Prayāga as its focus, it is concerned with 
1223Ambalal Dalsukharam Thakar, Reconstruction of Śaṅkha-Likhita Smṛti = Śaṅkhalikhita Smr̥tiḥ (Delhi: Bharatiya Kala Prakashan, 2003). 
1367Gayā. Just as significantly, while it mentions the donning of the guise of an ascetic 
(kārpatīveṣa), nowhere does it allude to the shaving of the head. Again, these are not mere 
oversights, but instead reflect the fact that the ritual deployment of each of these elements prior 
to their reimagining in our nibandha was highly context, place, and time specific. In order to 
overcome this host of apparent shortcomings in his sources, which stubbornly seem to keep 
resisting perfect alignment with his intentions, rather than locating additional proof texts more 
favorable to his approach, Hemādri resorts instead to the strategic application of a series of 
further exegetical strategies that find their points of origin in the discursive worlds of Mīmāṃsā 
and late classical Nyāya. 
Hemādri: 
Even if it is the case that this bearing of the garb of ascetic, having [first] worshipped Gaṇeśa, the grahas, and iṣṭadevatā,and the [specific] fruit derived from going [on pilgrimage] are known in scripture to refer only [to pilgrimage to] Gayā—even so—it [this vidhāna] is also to be understood with regard to going to another Tīrtha. 
[This follows:] According to the maxim that what applies to one place also applies to another place [if the meaning of the śāstra is ascertained in regard to one place in the same text, it would also apply to another location], when there is the semantic expectancy (ākaṅkṣā) of a statement of the “fruit”/result, because it is revealed as “having the fruit of going on pilgrimage,” it is reasonable that in another location as well, it would “have the fruit of going on pilgrimage,” because it is included as a proximate component [within the same system]. But it is not, however, that the fruit is to be conceptualized according to the viśvajit maxim.1224 
This is a dense passage, full of elliptical invocations of a meta-śāstric background in 
which Hemādri assumes his reader would have fluency, but which is utterly foreign even to 
most scholars of Indian religions for whom the mechanics of Smārta paddhatis remains an 
undiscovered country. Making it accessible will take some effort. Essentially, as we alluded to 
1224Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Tīrthakhaṇḍa: idaṃ ca kārpatīveṣadhāraṇaṃ gaṇeśaṃ grahān iṣṭadevatāṃ ca sampūjya gamanaphalaṃ ca yady [a]pi gayāyām eva śrūyate, tathāpi tīrthā[n]tarayātrāyām [api] d[ra]ṣṭavyam / ekatranirṇīta iti nyāyāt phalākā[ṅ]kṣāyā[ṃ] ca gamanaphalatvena śrutasyāsyaivānyatrāpi gamanaphalatvam ucitam antaraṅgatvāt, na tu viśvaj[i]nnyāyād atra phalakalpanaṃ // 
1368 
earlier, Hemādri has been preceding as if the sāmānyatīrthayātrā vidhi—in the language of 
Mīmāṃsā—is a vikṛti or ectypal ritual. This means that unlike the archetype ritual—say the 
darśapūrṇamāsa iṣṭi, discussed in detail systematically in a range of Vedic sources—this is a 
rite for which scripture does not provide us with direct instruction (upadeśa) regarding what is 
to be done (itikartavyatā), the materials used in ritual (dravya), or even the deity (devatā) 
governing the ritual. Indeed, all that scripture might give us directly is a cursory statement— 
“x ritual is to be done.” It is up to the ritualist to reconstruct the whole rite in a systematic 
fashion out of stray statements scattered throughout his sources. This is done primarily through 
the judicious application of the principle of substitution (atideśa). To simplify matters 
significantly, one of the many ways of determining whether or not two practices or elements 
can serve as appropriate substitutes is whether or not they serve the same purpose and are said 
to yield the same result. Another complementary principle in Mīmāṃsā exegesis is that if the 
passages delineating a particular ritual never specify the result of that ritual, rather than 
assuming the ritual bears no fruit, we can simply assume that its intended result is the obtaining 
of heaven at some point in the future. In fact, this principle is the very viśvajit-nyāya that 
Hemādri, intent on making it clear that the maxim does not apply in the case under discussion, 
explicitly invokes at the end of our passage. 
In short, part of what Hemādri is arguing is that even though in the sources he has cited, 
the specified ritual details of bearing the kārpatīveṣa and following this particular procedure 
of worshipping in sequence Gaṇeśa, the grahas, and one’s own chosen deity have been 
discussed solely in the context of pilgrimage to Gayā, in fact they apply to all sacred sites that 
have same designated fruit of “tīrthagamanaphala”—“the result you yield from going on 
pilgrimage.” In practice, what this means is that every time a Purāṇic text describes something 
1369 
as, “a fruit you get from going on pilgrimage,” Hemādri is saying the statements in that passage 
falls under this category and can be used to supply additional details for ritual. With any luck, 
this part of our author’s argument has been rendered a bit more lucidly, setting aside the fact 
that, unlike good health, a spotted cow, or even heaven, “the fruit you get from pilgrimage” is 
not a specific result, but originally simply a place holder for whatever results the text will go 
on to supply in detail. In other words, this systemization is based on nominalizing and reifying 
a mere tautology. 
Rather unexpectedly, however, Hemādri then supplements what—apart from the non- 
Vedic nature of the texts he is analyzing—is pretty standard Mīmāṃsā-style reasoning with 
something genuinely arcane, an obscure exegetical rule—the ekatra nirṇīta nyāya, drawn from 
an even more gnomic discourse. This principle is not found within the standard Mīmāṃsā tool 
kit, but first seems to surface in the writings of the eleventh-century Kashmiri Naiyāyika 
Udayana, a radically innovator thinker in his own right responsible for the consolidation of the 
previously separate schools of Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika into a single discipline and often perceived 
as the fore-father of the new logic.1225 Rather remarkably, Hemādri seems to have derived this 
principle from Udayana’s famous treatises that sets out to prove the existence of god, “The 
Bouquet of Reasons” (Nyāyakusumañjali), where the principle is invoked and explained at 
1225On Udayana in general, whose key texts have yet to be translated, the reader is directed to George Chemparathy, An Indian Rational Theology: Introduction to Udayana's Nyāyakusumāñjali (Leiden: Brill, 1972); M. Tachikawa, The Structure of the World in Udayana’s Realism: A Study of the Lakṣaṇāvalī and The Kiraṇāvalī (Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1981); John Vattanky, Development of Nyāya Theism (New Delhi: Intercultural Publications, 1993). In regard to the difficulties of the later portion of the fifth book of the Nyāyakusumañjali, which are largely passed over by other authors, special mention should be made of Bhaswati Sinha’s contributions, which I have found invaluable in making sense of the text: Bhaswati Sinha, Nyāyakusumāñjali: Hindu Rational Enquiry into the Existence of God: Interpretative Exposition of Udayanācārya’s Auto- Commentary with Translation of Kārikās (New Delhi: Aryan Books International, 1999). 
1370 
some length in chapter five.1226 Chapter five of the Nyāyakusumañjali is mostly dedicated to 
offering a series of what at the time were thoroughly novel but to us are still nonetheless 
relatively straightforward proofs of the existence of God arrived at by means of inferential 
reasoning (anumāna). Sadly for us, what Hemādri actually decides to take up as an integral 
part of his intellectual apparatus is not this comparatively accessible material, but rather the 
argument with which the Nyāyakusumañjali closes, one of the most difficult parts of the text, 
the analysis of which has been scrupulously avoided to this date by Western scholars.1227 
Though this is very difficult material, it is worth taking some time and wrestling with the sort 
of intellectual resources that are inspiring Hemādri, for as we will see they deeply inform his 
rethinking of the very nature of ritual and religion. 
This last part of “The Bouquet of Reasons” has as its focus nothing less than the 
refutation of Mīmāṃsaka ritual mechanism and atheism, and Udayana sets out to accomplish 
this objective by deploying the very same tools and reading strategies that Mīmāṃsā had made 
use of in theorizing the injunctive force of Vedic statements. The position Udayana will 
ultimately arrive at—this is incidentally the very stance that Romila Thapar has retrojected 
back into the origins of Hindu thought1228 but is in fact first in evidence in the eleventh 
century—is that just as all injunctive statements in the optative that tell you what you should 
do presume the intentionality of an authoritative person (āpta), when it comes to scripture, the 
authority that enjoins specific ritual actions is in fact God. In Udayana’s language, injunctions 
(vidhi) signify the intention (abhiprāya) of the speaker (vāktṛ). An injunction enjoins a specific 
1226 Though consulting several editions and commentaries, the present analysis depends on the unspecified version of the Nyāyakusumañjali archived at GRETIL: http://gretil.sub.uni- goettingen.de/gretil/corpustei/transformations/html/sa_udayana-nyAyakusumAJjali.htm 1227George Chemparathy in his introduction to the Nyāyakusumañjali, for example, even in giving his synoptic summary of the structure and content of the text, simply omits covering the last third of the fifth chapter, the content of which plays no role in his analysis. 1228For more details see the discussion in Chapter 1. 
1371 
activity (pravṛtti) or cessation from activity (nivṛtti) conveyed to the listener, and it does this 
by means of the bare presence of the optative verbal formation (liṅ and so forth). When the 
sound of the optative is heard by the listener—even before the exact content of that command 
is cognized—it instantly tells you that there is something that needs to be done or not done. In 
order to actually accomplish this task, however, the agent will have to first properly cognize 
its contents—this is his or her responsibility—and then they will have to make use of a 
procedure for accomplishing the specified task that actually works—which is the responsibility 
of the one giving the directions. In other words, in contrast to Mīmāṃsā, Udayana proposes 
that ritual injunctions (vidhi), and by extension ritual systems, are not a value neutral 
technology that is made effective by the proper execution of an inherited or derived ritual 
procedure. Instead, as we are about to see, he argues injunctions are always value-laden—this 
is what he calls vidhipratyaya—and expressions of a particular worldview, often one that is 
provided by the supreme creator. 
Against the Mīmāṃsakas, who viewed all action as motivated and made possible by 
desire (kāma), Udayana argues that what structures activity (pravṛtti) is not primarily the 
desires of the ritual actor himself—these do not cause anything to happen directly—but rather 
the degree of effort (prayatna) that this actor consciously invests in executing what, if anything 
meaningful is to result, must be an efficacious procedure, the efficaciousness of which is 
judged by the agent responsible for its creation. A simple example will help us see what 
Udayana is really saying. Imagine a child whose parents yell from the other room—“Go Clean 
your room!” The child first hears their parents say the word “Go!” Their body, mostly 
unconsciously, responds with nervous physical energy, causing them for example to shift 
posture (Udayana calls this the kāyaparispandamātra). Only if and when child actually gets 
1372 
up does any actual “going” take place. In other words, the child has to apply conscious 
deliberate effort if any action whatsoever is going to occur. If all the child hears is that initial 
“Go!”—this is of course a vidhi of sorts—all sorts of “actions” might well take place—out of 
fear, for example, the kid may take off and run out the front door—but it is very unlikely that 
the intended relationship between a command—Go!— and a specific outcome, the cleaning of 
the room, will emerge of its own accord. In order for that to happen, the child will have to 
experience the command acting upon his body as well as engage in a deliberate effort, but he 
or she will also have to realize that the statement is applicable to them specifically and then to 
listen to and understand the semantic content of the rest of the statement “Go clean your room!” 
So far this is pretty straightforward. Udayana, however, then adds in one more very 
interesting observation. It is still not enough to recognize that the agent recognizes a command 
is given, that it applies to him, and then to cognize it in general terms. In order for the activity 
to be a success, action does not just have to be undertaken, but it has to be done in accordance 
with the standards assumed by the speaker doing the enjoining. In other words, if a child wants 
the act of “cleaning the room” to result in a positive response from their parent, they have to 
figure out what this particular authority figure really means when they say “clean.” While, for 
some parents, “clean” might mean simply that nothing should be on the floor in the room, or 
even just that specific items—just as dirty clothing—be removed, others might anticipate that 
everything will be put away in its proper place, the whole room has been vacuumed, or even 
that the base boards have been scrubbed by hand. What determines which of these requirements 
is applicable and will result in “cleaning the room” actually being a means towards the 
accomplishing of the desired goal (iṣṭasādhānatā) is not some abstracted logical relationship 
or mechanistic activation of an arrangement of principles intrinsic to the architectonics that 
1373 
order our reality. It is nothing more or less than the inferred intentionality of the original 
speaker. For this reason, we must speak of any discourse—including the Veda—as comprised 
not simply of injunctions (vidhi)—but of a specific mental content that travels paired with that 
injunction (vidhipratyaya), the proper understanding of which determines the success or failure 
of the act or ritual. In other words, knowledge of an injunction does not really arise separate 
from knowledge about the object or focus of that injunction. 
In the fifth chapter, Udayana arrives at the positions we have just been outlining 
through a very intricate, systematic, and sophisticated engagement with the philosophy of the 
Sanskrit grammarians as well Mīmāṃsā analyses of the working of linguistic philosophy.1229 
In doing so he explores a whole host of possibilities, using the technical idiom of analyzing 
logical relationships in terms of their kāraka relationships, with the aim of examining whether 
or not injunctions are 1) attributes of the agent (kartṛdharmaḥ); (2) the attribute of the action 
(karmadharmaḥ); (3) attributes of the instrument (kāraṇadharmaḥ), before finally arriving at 
his preferred conclusion that the injunction is an attribute of the person that enjoins 
(niyoktṛdharmaḥ). We will take up very briefly just a few of these possibilities, namely, the 
stance that the injunction is an attribute of the action or the ritual sacrifice itself, which lies at 
the heart of Mīmāṃsā. 
First, we need to have in hand a bit of his philosophy of grammar. Responding to 
Kumārila Bhaṭṭa’s theorization of injunctive statements as having two dimensions of bhāvanā, 
the bare capacity for bringing something into being and the targeted capacity of bringing into 
being a specific thing or state of affairs (arthabhāvanā), Udayana proposes as an alternative 
that every verbal action can be parsed into at least two components, so that, for example, when 
1229The passages that contain the arguments we are considering runs from verses 5.11–17 in the autocommentary. 
1374 
we say “he cooks (pacati),” what we are really saying is “he does the cooking (pākaṃ karoti). 
In other words, all verbs can be analyzed so as to be made to take what in English we would 
call a direct object and what in Sanskrit grammatical thinking at the very least is an implied 
object. Udayana insists it is this hidden verbal “doing”—whether mentioned explicitly the way 
you would with a compound verb in Hindi or hidden in the suffix applied to the verbal root— 
that in the case of injunctive forms of the Verb communicate to the listener the inseparability 
of effort (prayatna) to the successful completion of ritual action. In essence, injunctive 
statements all communicate both a specific action (for example, cooking) that has to be done 
and that effort needs to be applied in order for the action to take places (x does whatever action). 
In other words, he proposes that the entire Vedic theory about the nature of the impelling force 
(codanā) of injunctions as lying at the very center of understanding dharma is completely 
wrong. 
A key part of the reason why he goes to all this trouble is that having established all of 
this within a framework legible to the grammarians as well as to Bhāṭṭa and Prābhākara 
Mīmāṃsā enables our author to offer from within the conventions of these disciplines a 
devastating critique of the standard Mīmāṃsā accounts, both Bhāṭṭa and Prābhākara, of the 
iconic injunction “svargakāmo yajetā”—the one desirous of heaven should sacrifice. This, we 
must remember, is grounded in the conception that the real focus of “Vedic” religion is the 
identification and proper analysis of injunctive statements found in the Veda where the verb 
possesses certain formal properties. What Udayana demonstrates is that once you revise your 
thinking about how injunctions work, the whole picture offered by traditional Mīmāṃsā 
collapses upon itself into a heap of contradictions that violate other presuppositions central to 
the system’s theory of reading or generally accepted by Indian logic. Thus, for example, if 
1375 
what injunctions conveyed to us were the desire for a specific result, rather than being the 
archetype for Mīmāṃsā style injunctive sentences, “svargakāmo yajetā” would bear the fault 
of inherent redundancy as svargakāmo and the verbal suffix would serve the exact same 
function, a major no-no in śāstra. 
The real problem arrives, however, when we take this new theory of how injunctions 
work and then need to account for the role assigned to “apūrva”—the unprecedented—which 
for the Bhāṭṭas is what makes ritual work causally and for the Prābhākaras is what makes 
recovering specific ritual procedures possible. Unlike other human activities, emically 
speaking, from Mīmāṃsā’s perspective, ritual tells us to do something “unprecedented” that 
serves no human purpose. What Udayana asserts is that for some very good reasons, we cannot 
accept that the injunctive suffix in the verb communicates to us something about or is even 
logically related to the “unprecedented.” When we read sentences, regardless of whether we 
accept the Bhāṭṭa model that the sentence meaning is comprehended word by word or the 
Prābhākara notion that we mentally grasp whole sentences as syntactic units together, we are 
engaged in a cognitive process that takes words and their meanings as conceptual objects. In 
other words, our mind relates to the sentence in much the same way that it would when we see 
a table or a tiger. But the whole point of something being apūrva is that it brings into being 
some state of affairs in the future that does not and cannot exist in the present. As Udayana 
says, it is the absence of all possibility of previous perceptions. So here is the problem: if we 
cannot by definition know what a thing is or have any access to that thing, there is no way 
within the rules of Indian philosophy that we logically demonstrate that it has any relation to 
any of the things we do know. 
1376 
For example, how we know what words mean is that either we, or someone else, 
already knew what those words meant beforehand. Recall, if you will, the child who heard the 
statement “go clean your room.” In order for any action to take place that is logically connected 
to the meaning of either those words or the sentence that contains them, both the speaker and 
the observer needed to know what all the words mean. This is why if you were to yell “go 
clean your room,” and the sentence is overheard by a salamander, an infant, or a person from 
Equatorial Guinea who has never heard English before, the room is probably not going to get 
cleaned. What Udayana points out, is that even if by some miracle said statement was made 
and then the amphibian or person who was being spoken to proceeded to crawl or walk away 
and go and clean the room, there is no logical grounds for establishing that a causal relationship 
existed between the two activities—in other words, that one thing followed necessarily from 
the other and will do so again in the future given certain circumstances. This is especially true 
as in several of the above cases, a key component in the sentence—the very idea of “your 
room”—especially as applied to a salamander or a culturally remote stranger, is about as 
unthinkable as the notion of apūrva. Were the cleaning of a room to happen, we would simply 
assume it was pure chance, or there is another actual causal relationship unrelated to the one 
we have been exploring that we have missed. 
Expanding on this observation and addressing much more pointedly the objections of 
Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā, Udayana next goes on to demonstrate a further parallel problem. A 
statement like “svargakāmo yajeta” as interpreted by followers of Prabhākara implies a 
statement about what is to be done (niyoga), a specific sacrifice, and well as a specified result 
(niyojya), in this case, heaven. Since at the end of a yajna people do not rise up into the sky, 
however, we know that the sacrificial act does not produce its desired result at the moment of 
1377its completion, but, we are assured, sometime in the future. But if ritual is the cause of heaven, 
we have a problem, because the ritual has completely ceased to exist by the time its apparent 
effect manifests. It is for this reason then the apūrva is posited as a subtle and lasting bridge 
linking cause and effect. The idea is that its existence must be implied by the injunction if we 
are to assume any causal relationship between sacrifice and heaven. Udayana’s response is 
once again that, if you accept standard Mīmāṃsā accounts about how we acquire authoritative 
knowledge, there is no logical reason to associate being unprecedented (apūrvatva) with being 
a cause at all. The reason this is the case is because there are only two ways we could connect 
them: an act of recollection or an act of inferential reasoning. The problem is that you can only 
recollect something you have already seen or known before, and apūrva, by definition, is a 
thing that has never been seen or known before. In a similar spirit, inference demands that we 
already know the relationship and nature of two things being connected, and that is precisely 
what we are trying to find out. Finally, since we do not know what apūrva is nor any of its 
properties, logically speaking, we cannot even determine if it is the same sort of thing or a 
different sort of thing than being a cause, any more than one could compare and contrast a 
camel and a “jsiozjgieha.” This is because, in any case, either the grasping of the differences 
between things (bhedagraha) or the non-grasping of a difference (bhedāgraha) always 
involves act of comparison, and you cannot compare and contrast two things when you know 
absolutely nothing at all about one of them. Udayana’s point is that apūrva is not just a 
philosophically questionable premise, but it really does not even amount to a form of nonsense, 
since we cannot even determine whether it does or does not possess any specific properties or 
has or does not have any particular meaning. As we discussed earlier, Udayana’s solution to 
all these scholastic entanglements is to propose that the coherency of ritual—both what it 
1378 
means and how it works—is a property of the one who enjoins it (niyoktṛ), which in many 
cases is in fact the creator deity himself. 
For Udayana, all the arguments we have just been exploring are leading up to a proof 
of the dependence of Indic ritual as a coherent system on God’s existence, one which in its 
particulars overlap in many places with Hemādri’s own positions as put forth in the 
Kaivalayadīpikā. And yet from the perspective of a social historian, utterly unqualified to stake 
lofty claims on such matters, this very same line of argumentation can also be read as arriving 
at a parallel observation, namely, that ritual becomes meaningful and actionable only when it 
is mediated by particular social relationships, whether between specific humans or between 
humans and nonhumans. As advocated by Udayana, this socialization of ritual knowledge— 
quite specifically of the types of ritual knowledge that Mīmāṃsā had claimed as its own 
exclusive purview—represents a shift in orientation, not only in degree but of kind. It offers 
an intellectual change in perspective akin to the trading off of logical positivism for 
phenomenology, with Udayana and those, like Hemādri, who are influenced by him, playing 
the role of a Wittgenstein, who takes methods from the first system and deploys them in the 
service of an entirely different sort of worldview. Once you make this transition, as Hemādri 
has clearly done, even when you are reading the exact same texts and applying shared 
exegetical techniques, you will end up doing different things with your sources because now 
and forever, ritual is inseparable from its social implications and the intentionalities of those 
authorities (human and otherwise) who enjoin its practice. In other words, everything you have 
to do is now inseparable from a certain given worldview. 
As our exploration of the exegetical method that underlies the unpublished 
Tīrthakhaṇḍa comes to a close—a method that we have now seen in our author’s own 
1379 
understanding is inseparable from a whole host of theological as well as methodological 
presuppositions—the last task on our agenda is demonstrating concretely that Hemādri’s 
theoretical work and choice of materials in the lost Tīrthakhaṇḍa, though sui generis in their 
own time, had a lasting impact on the subsequent history of Hindu religion, especially in terms 
of the Smārta discourses of Early modernity. This is a vast and mostly uncharted field, where 
most of the key texts remain either unpublished or unstudied. Rather than attempting to 
historicize Hemādri’s impact, we will have to make do with a single example of overwhelming 
direct textual influence. The text we will turn to as emblematic of a much larger story is Richard 
Salomon’s edition and translation of the opening division of the sixteenth-century Bridge of 
the Three Holy Cities (Tristhalīsetu) of the Deśastha Brāhmaṇa Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa.1230 Though 
the influential polymath and public intellectual Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa was himself active in 
Varanasi, as Sheldon Pollock, Rosland O’Hanlon, and Christopher Minkowski have all 
discussed at some length, the Bhaṭṭa line from which he and his descendants among early 
modernity’s new intellectuals sprang had its origins in central Maharashtra, with the progenitor 
of the line, Rāmeśvara Bhaṭṭa, being active primarily within the Seuṇadeśa in the generation 
after Hemādri.1231 
1230Richard Salomon, ed. and trans., The Bridge to the Three Holy Cities: The Sāmānya-praghaṭṭaka of Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa’s Tristhalīsetu (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1985). 1231Though a polymath intellectual who produced an ocean of śāstric and ritual works, Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa is remembered primarily as the person responsible for petitioning the Mughal court to permit the reestablishing of the Kāśī Viśveśvara Temple, an effort ultimately made moot by its subsequent destruction by Aurangzeb in the next generation. On the Bhaṭṭas, who have been the subject of a number of works of intellectual and social history, many of them among the best the discipline has to offer, see for example: Rosalind O’Hanlon and Christopher Minkowski, “What Makes People Who They Are? Pandit Networks and the Problem of Livelihoods in Early Modern Western India,” The Indian Economic & Social History Review 45, no. 3 (2008): 381–416.” Rosalind O’Hanlon, “Speaking from Siva’s Temple: Banaras Scholar Households and the Brahman ‘Ecumene’ of Mughal India,” South Asian History and Culture 2, no. 2 (2011): 253–277; Rosalind O’Hanlon, “Contested Conjunctures: Brahman Communities and “Early Modernity” in India,” The American Historical Review 118, no. 3 (2013): 765–787; Rosalind O’Hanlon, “Letters Home: Banaras Pandits and the Maratha Regions in Early Modern India,” Modern Asian Studies 44, no. 2 (2010): 201–40; Rosalind O’Hanlon, “In the Presence of Witnesses: Petitioning and Judicial ‘Publics’ in Western India, c. 1600–1820,” Modern Asian Studies 53, no. 1 (2019): 52– 88; Sheldon Pollock, “New Intellectuals in Seventeenth-century India,” The Indian Economic & Social History

It is interesting in this regard to note that though Salomon seems ignorant of the 
existence of Hemādri’s Tīrthakhaṇḍa, the introduction to his edition repeatedly seems to be 
inferring not only the existence of an unknown intermediary between this work and the 
Kṛtyakalpataru but assigning to this lost source an array of seemingly discrete topical concerns 
and allusions, nearly all of which are found in our Tīrthakhaṇḍa. As Salomon writes: 
The general section of the TSS is by no means an entirely original work. This general arrangement of the text, and in many cases the specific wording, are derived from a tradition developed in the earlier texts on the subject of tīrtha. In a number of cases, NB borrows passages virtually verbatim from earlier tīrtha and dharmaśāstra texts such as the Tīrthacintāmaṇi, Smṛtyarthasāra, and Madanapārijāta, without acknowledging the source. . . . It is not until the time of Lakṣmīdhara (early 12th century A.D.) that we know of any independent dharmaśāstra text devoted entirely to these subjects. . . . The next important tīrtha text which is now available is the Tīrthacintāmaṇi (TīCi) of Vācaspati Miśra of Mithilā. . . . This text is quite advanced in comparison with that of Lakṣmīdhara, and since it refers to points of controversy not yet raised in the TVK there must have been at least one, if not several texts written on the subject between the time of Lakṣmīdhara and that of Vācaspati. One of these texts must have been by Gaṇeśvara Miśra, whom Vācaspati cites occasionally. . . but unfortunately the works of Gaṇeśvara are not extant.1232 
Turning to the Tristhalīsetu itself, starting from the very title of this division of the 
text—sāmānyapraghaṭṭaka—Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa pursues an intellectual project, namely, to 
present “first, the general rules for tīrthas” which are to be “properly described,” and then to 
offer “the rules for the three tīrthas, beginning with Prayāga,” unimaginable without the 
Tīrthakhaṇḍa. As we are about to see, though he never mentions our work by name, even if 
we only take into account the tiny portion of the Tīrthakhaṇḍa we have been exploring, his 
text is saturated with examples and glosses drawn from our text. Where Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa 
diverges from our work, in fact, is primarily in offering a more fluid sort of discourse that is 
even less dependent on the specific proof texts that he invokes for its structure. In other words, 
Review 38, no. 1 (2001): 3–31; Sheldon Pollock, The Ends of Man at the End of Premodernity (Amsterdam: Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, 2005). 1232 Salomon, The Bridge to the Three Holy Cities, xvii–xviii. Emphasis added. 
1381 
he is much better at organizing his sources into a single cohesive argument that does not get 
derailed by long tangents. 
As the Tristhalīsetu begins, for most of the opening chapter on “the praise of the 
purposes of men,” the points of commonality are not so evident except at a purely conceptual 
level.1233 As the title announces, Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa’s focus here initially is theorizing how ritual 
serves human ends, what specific ends those might be (such as happiness and the avoiding of 
suffering) as well as how we might reconcile or prioritize soteriological concerns with our 
quotidian aims. Right away he is telling us that ritual is about people and not about the internal 
coherency of scholastic symbolic systems whose purpose is in actuality to support human aims. 
It is only as the chapter closes that Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa turns to the proof text from the 
Mahābhārata with which Lakṣmīdhara and Hemādri both began. It is only when we see how 
he glosses key terms in this passage that it becomes clear he is following Hemādri: 
MBH: Even by those who have just their own body [lit. with a single body] (ekātmabhiḥ), are separated from their companions (avaganaiḥ) and who are devoid of assistance (asamhataiḥ), the ancestors are made to cross over and the grandfathers [are extracted] from the hells. 
Hemādri: Where the texts says “who have just their own body” (ekātmabhiḥ), [what is meant is] who is without a wife (patnīrahitaiḥ). Where the text says, “who are not well equipped,” [what is meant is] those who lack a Ṛgvedic and Sāmavedic priest and so forth. 
Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa (trans. Salomon): Single men (ekātmabhiḥ) means unmarried men (apatnīkaiḥ). Unaccompanied men (asamhataiḥ) means men without the company of ṛtvijs and other priests (ṛtvigādisaṃghātaśūnyaiḥ).1234 
Just as we have seen in our other studies of formalized textual production, based on 
divergences in word choice and syntax, it is clear here that Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa is not merely 
1233Salomon, The Bridge to the Three Holy Cities, 3–7. 1234Salomon, The Bridge to the Three Holy Cities, translation pg. 197, edition pg. 4. See above for the text from the Mahābhārata and Tīrthakhaṇḍa. 
1382 
blindly copying glosses from the Tīrthakhaṇḍa, but is instead reworking the material again and 
again to fit his own idiom and style, a state of affairs which if anything suggests an even greater 
fundamental continuity at the points where the two texts overlap because we can tell it is 
deliberate and selective. For the next four chapters—the general praise of tīrthas 
(sāmānyatīrthapraśaṃsā), the nature of tīrthas (tīrthasvarūpa), and secondary tīrthas 
(gauṇatīrthas), and those authorized to make pilgrimage (tīrthayātrādhikāriṇaḥ)—points of 
overlap, at least with the text we have been examining, are much more sparse. At each step 
along the way, Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa’s main objective seems to be a focused form of clarification 
and delimiting of the topics under discussion. Thus, for example, the reason we get a subsection 
on secondary tīrthas is that one of his sources starts its discussion by listing actual places and 
then transitions into talking about such metaphorical “tīrthas” as truthfulness and philanthropy, 
resulting in our author feeling the need to pause and sort out the distinction.1235 In a major 
refinement of Hemādri, though building on the śrīkaraṇeśvara’s own tendencies, such 
discussions are typically focused in a single portion of the text that forms a discrete unit from 
what logically came before it. But once we get past this new organizational apparatus and come 
to the points of topical overlap with the early sections of the Tīrthakhaṇḍa, the parallels 
suddenly become overwhelming, far more than a case of a few stray shared glosses. 
Fully half of the very short next chapter, “the causes of varying degrees of benefit from 
tīrthas” is dedicated to exploring—again, with exactly the same proof text and shared 
glosses—the figure of the one who goes of tīrtha on behalf of someone else—which Nārāyaṇa 
Bhaṭṭa also understands as a pilgrim for hire. The section that immediately follows, “varying 
degrees of benefit caused by particular vehicles, ”as you might already anticipate from the title, 
1235Salomon, The Bridge to the Three Holy Cities, 206–7. 
1383 
begins by offering, albeit with half a verse more of the proof text than we find in the 
Tīrthakhaṇḍa, just what will befall you if you set out for Prayāga riding a bull.1236 It then 
provides the same the rule—that one should avoid vehicles—and the same modification of that 
rule cited by Hemādri. The commentary focuses on the exact same terms of art and is again 
nearly verbatim and it builds to the overturning of the rule forbidding the use of vehicles, once 
again using the very same proof text and arguments we saw in Hemādri. 
Making an argument unknown to our Tīrthakhaṇḍa, by quibbling over a point of 
grammar, Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa then responds to and refutes a new authority. At this point, in a 
more extended discussion than what we find in the earlier text, he resumes Hemādri’s 
enumeration of the scales of the relative karmic merit yielded by using different vehicles. New 
topics then ensue, unknown to the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, such as what happens if you only use 
a vehicle part of the way, or how do ships figure into this calculus. In the next two chapters, 
these are followed by highly technical considerations of the scale of bodies of water and 
astrology, also not found in the older text. But again, once we are back on the familiar topical 
terrain of the way of going to tīrthas (tīrthagamana), it is Hemādri’s text that sets the 
agenda.1237 In other words, what we keep seeing again and again is evidence that Hemādri’s 
Tīrthakhaṇḍa, and not the works of Lakṣmīdhara, provides the topical and conceptual basis for 
the conversations of the next several centuries. 
Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than in the Tristhalīsetu’s ninth chapter. Here, 
Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa’s framework for the common vidhi for tīrtha is unmistakably identical with 
the one that Hemādri had “derived” using Mīmāṃsā principles from a passage in the 
1236Salomon, The Bridge to the Three Holy Cities, 219–27. The textual dependence on Hemādri’s Tīrthakhaṇḍa is particularly evident on pg. 219–220. 1237Salomon, The Bridge to the Three Holy Cities, 239–51. 
1384 
Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa. Indeed, the Tristhalīsetu not only quotes this same passage verbatim but 
it privileges and discounts the same elements selected by Hemādri. Our śāstrin’s next major 
subject is also identical with what we find in the Tīrthakhaṇḍa, namely, a debate with an 
opponent over whether the common procedure applies only to people going to Prayāga or is to 
be used during all pilgrimages.1238 Though Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa assigns this objector’s view only 
to “a certain someone,” the arguments being presented, such as the contestation over the role 
of shaving at the śrāddha and whether it is only to be done at Gayā, are the very ones Hemādri 
identified as belonging to Gaṇeśvaramiśra.1239 Nārāyaṇa’s presentation, which simply singles 
out and then refutes Miśra’s two objections, is both more terse and more clear. Along the way 
he even manages to integrate into the discussion some of the observations found earlier in 
Hemādri about the role played by ghee as the mukhyadravya in the language of Mīmāṃsā and 
the difference between abhyudayaśrāddha and pārvaṇaśrāddha.1240 In each of these 
discussions, things that in Hemādri have to simply be inferred are stated outright. In Hemādri, 
as we have seen, all of these arguments are building up to the introduction of the ekatra nīrṇita 
nyāya, which teaches the functional interchangeability of sacred sites that have the same 
1238Salomon, The Bridge to the Three Holy Cities, 239–41. 1239Salomon, The Bridge to the Three Holy Cities, 240. In Salomon’s translation: “Some say that shaving of the head is also to be performed before the śrāddha on the day of the fast, according to the words of Viṣṇu: ‘On a pilgrimage to Prayāga, or because of separation from one’s mother and father, one should shave his hair. One who has shaven would not act in vain.’ Some say this applies only to a pilgrimage undertaken for the sake of penance, since shaving is prescribed in connection with that (penance). Others say it applies (only) when one goes to the tīrtha in a pilgrim’s dress.” 1240Salomon, The Bridge to the Three Holy Cities, 240–241. In Salomon’s translation: “The śrāddha (done before leaving), like the śrāddha at the tīrtha, should be a pārvaṇa-śrāddha, with six, nine, or twelve deities, according to different opinions. A certain author says: ‘This śrāddha has ghee alone as its offering material, according to the words of the Viṣṇupurāṇa. . . . If it were combined with other substances, that would cancel the sense of the instrumental case of ‘with ghee,’ which denotes an independent means, as in the phrase ‘One should sacrifice with grains of rice.’ This is not so, because the literal statement (‘with ghee’) must be restricted in order to avoid a meaningless statement; for ghee alone cannot be the (only) material for a śrāddha, because it cannot be eaten by itself. Thus others say: ‘(The śrāddha-offering consists) mainly of ghee.’ This is also not so; because the instrumental case is not used to prescribe ‘plentitude’; and because this would constitute indirect expression (lakṣaṇā). Therefore the meaning is ‘with ghee as the principal material’, because the instrumental case indicates that ghee is not dependent on any other equally important main material.” 
1385 
specified fruit. But while this feature, retained by Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa, also serves as the 
culminating topic in this part of the Tristhalīsetu, an important divergence has emerged, as we 
can see when we compare Hemādri’s own words with those of Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa. Parallels are 
marked in bold in the footnotes below. 
Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa: Others, however say ‘So be it; the journey is beneficial. But nevertheless, this same benefit which is proclaimed for a journey to Gayā. ‘One going to Gayā gets at every step the benefit of an aśvamedha sacrifice.’---applies to all pilgrimages, according to the rule, ‘the meaning of a sacred text determined in one place (applies) elsewhere also.’ 
When the benefit of a pilgrimage is to be specified, it would be appropriate that this same benefit already mentioned be that benefit, as it is closely connected in that it is also a benefit of ‘going.’ 
Postulating the benefit to be heaven by invoking the rule of the Viśvajit sacrifice would involve an excessive effort in bringing that rule to mind, because it is only remotely connected to this case. This too is sheer foolishness, for in various places the benefits of pilgrimages are mentioned.1241 
As we can see, Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa retains much of Hemādri’s language but fundamentally 
misses the point of his argument. Perhaps this is because some of Hemādri’s core premises, 
such as that every tīrtha is worth going to and will yield some benefit, even if said benefits 
have not been carefully specified in a given proof text, have simply become common sense. 
As deployed by Hemādri, the whole point of the ekatranīrṇita nyāya is to arrive at the 
understanding that, in all cases where the benefits of different pilgrimages to various places 
are stated as having the same benefit, those places are functionally equivalent. Thus, in all such 
cases, one can use the same vidhāna. From this perspective, the invocation of a so-called “Gayā 
1241H: ekatranirṇīta iti nyāyāt phalākā[ṅ]kṣāyā ca gamanaphalatvena śrutasyāsyaivānyatrāpi gamanaphalatvam ucitam antaraṅgatvāt, na tu viśvaj[i]n-nyāyād atra phalakalpanaṃ, tasya [b]ahiraṃgatvenopasthitigauravāt / NB: ekatranirṇītaḥ śāstrārtho ’paratrāpīti nyāyāt phalākā[ṅ]kṣāyāñ ca gamanaphalatvena śrutasyāsyaivāntaraṅgatayā phalaucityāt, viśvajin-nyāyād svargakalpane bahiraṅgatvenopasthitigauravāt / Translation of Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa in Salomon, The Bridge to the Three Holy Cities, 249. 
1386 
principle” was never intended to promote the rather narrow idea that has been ascribed to the 
pūrvapakṣin by Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa, namely, that for every pilgrimage where the result is not 
specified, “every step has the benefit of an aśvamedha sacrifice.” Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa, in contrast, 
is totally uninterested in justifying that pilgrimages to specific places have intrinsic merit and 
yield specific benefit. For him, that seems to be a fundamental feature of the discourse on 
pilgrimage. What he is invested in is developing a hitherto unknown calculus for determining 
as precisely as possible the comparative virtues of different modes of pilgrimage. Indeed, as 
he alludes to shortly in the above passage, as he understands it, interpretive tools such as the 
so-called “Gayā principle” are problematic because they provide the pilgrim with loopholes 
that circumvent a now hegemonically established Smārta ritual world. After all, once you 
presume you only need one aśvamedha’s worth of merit, and you know you can get that already 
from taking a single step in a sacred space, why would bother spending the time and money 
taking part in the rest of the Smārta pilgrimage imaginary? In other words, Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa is 
defending a core part of Hemādri’s siddhānta by using a bit of Hemādri to refute another bit 
of a now problematically construed Hemādri. One could hardly ask a greater confirmation of 
just how completely the words and ideas of the author of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi have 
saturated the discourse on pilgrimage among early modern Smārtas. 
Exercises in Excising a Śākta Landscape: Hemādri and the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya 
In its published form, much of which corresponds virtually verbatim with the citations found 
in Hemādri’s Tīrthakhaṇḍa, the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya makes up the concluding portion of 
the vulgate Skanda Purāṇa. As its title conveys, the work is almost exclusively concerned with 
offering a guide for pilgrims to the history and ritual practices that lie behind the collection of 
sacred sites that surrounded the self-arising liṅga of Somanātha located in Saurashtra. The text 
1387as it is transmitted within the Caturvargacintāmaṇi is self-evidently a product of an era 
subsequent to the desecration by Mahmud of Ghazni of what was then at its core a wooden 
temple. Most plausibly, as it is entirely unknown to the early twelfth-century dharma literature, 
the māhātmya in its current form was composed in the middle of the twelfth century, sometime 
during the reign of the Solaṅkī Cāḷukya ruler Kumārapāla (1143–1172 CE).1242 Such a point 
of origin would coincide with the massive program of renovation and renewal that repopulated 
the landscape with stone structures, which is reflected in our text.1243 In other words, the 
1242There is a substantial corpus of Solaṅkī Cāḷukya court kāvyas that could be used to properly reconstruct the relationship of the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya to the world of Kumārapāla. A key resource for orientating us to the scope of this discourse is: Bhogilal Sandesara, The Literary Circle of Mahāmātya Vastupāla and its Contributions to Sanskrit Literature (Bombay: Singhi Jain Sastra Sikshapatha, 1953). To invoke just a single example, Jinaharṣa in his Vastupālacarita tells us that when he went on pilgrimage acting on behalf of his king, Vastupāla would offer a garland of the skulls of the enemies of the king, inlaid with rubies, to what elsewhere is clarified to be the four headed form of Somanātha in the sacred fields of Saurāṣṭra. Jinaharṣagaṇi, Vastupālacarita 6.540–41: śrīvīradhavalādhīśasvāntasantoṣahetave / someśvaraṃ tadānarca mantrī nānāvidhārcanaiḥ // narendrādeśato mantrī somanāthamaheśituḥ / māṇikyakhacitāṃ muṇḍamālāmayam akārayat // Phullacandra Chotalal and Shantilal Kalidasa, ed., Śrīmajjinaharṣagaṇipranītaṃ Śrīvastupālacaritṃa, ed. Muni Kirtivijaya (Ahmedabad: Sri Sarada Mudranalaya, 1997). In the Kīrtikaumudi, in addition to another account of Somanātha in sarga eight, we are also offered accounts of Vastupāla, again a Jain minister, participating in the diṅmaṇḍalī and the festival of the goddess Ekallavīrā, an affair that resembles the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya’s bhūtamātā utsava we will discuss below at some length. Abajisarma Visnu Kathavate, ed., Kīrtikaumudī: A Life of Vastupāla, A Minister of Lavaṇaprasāda & Vīradhavala Vaghelās (Bombay: Government Central Book Depository, 1883). 1243As I hope to demonstrate in a future study, the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya displays numerous signs of representing a mid-twelfth-century redaction. It is intent upon, as it tells us, bringing existing traditions into alignment with the Vaidika norms (vedasammata). Yet at the same time, it has actively drawn upon a range of older Tantric sources, which are often only partially digested. This state of affairs explains the ubiquitous casual allusions throughout the text to Tantric trade secrets such as the thirty-six tattvas and the conquest of the six adhvans. Indeed, in its second chapter, which candidly alludes to some of the māhātmya’s sources, the work actually refers to many such kalpas by name, associated with Mahālakṣmī, the Garuḍa Tantras, and so forth, aligning them with specific subsections within the text. Often the redactional process, which imposes a proto- Smārta-Śaiva veneer, is extremely transparent. Consistently, what lies underneath, right down to the retention of aiśa modes of compounding and idiom, (such as an eccentric use of x-vivarjita in the sense of transcending-x as opposed to devoid of x, resembling early Kālī Krama scriptures) is a heavily epistemologized and vaguely non- dual form of Śākta Tantra. Thus, Someśa himself, for example, in the sixth chapter, is identified in passing as originally being known of as Nirvāṇabhairava, who is beyond duality (dvaitavarjitaṃ), whose state is devoid of the elaboration of language (vākprapañcādirahitam), established in the observation of knowledge and the means of knowing (jñānajñeyāvalokasthitaṃ) and yet beyond the mere appearance of causality (hetvābhāsavivarjitam) (Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya 5.10–11). The text discusses at some length how these Bhairavamata traditions have in the present generation been replaced by the recitation of the Śatarudrīya and other Vedicizing Śaiva texts. As for some of the original demographics involved in making pilgrimage to the region, the third chapter in this regard is particularly telling. After first introducing the practice of pilgrimage in the most general terms, it then obsesses at some length with remarkable specificity about the “wrong motivations” and wrong understanding for going on pilgrimage, alluding, for example to a tradition of rasa siddhas whose activities are in opposition to varṇāśramadharma. Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya, pg. 5, vs. 3.119–122: evam uktaṃ mahādevi prabhāsaṃ kṣetraṃ uttamaṃ / dṛṣṭvā saṃskārarahitāḥ kalau pāpena mohitāḥ // rājasās tāmasāś caiva pāpohatacetasaḥ /

“Purāṇic lore” that the mid-thirteenth-century Caturvargacintāmaṇi has drawn upon as an 
authentic source of traditional knowledge was at the time itself in many cases probably less 
than a hundred years old. 
While each spot in the surrounding landscape comes equipped with its own legends, 
some of which are related at considerable length, the central pīṭha at Somanātha is said to mark 
the spot where Brahmā’s skull fell from the hands of the Lord and onto the ground.1244 It is this 
place, we are told, where Parameśvara in the form of Bhairava completed his twelve-year 
penance for the act of killing of a Brāhmaṇa. In other words, Somanātha has usurped the 
position that in classical sources like the Nepalese Skanda Purāṇa and the 
Picumatabrahmayāmala had previously been occupied by Prayāga, in central Uttar Pradesh. 
Thus, as part of a tradition our māhātmya has clearly inherited from much older sources, the 
Saurashtra peninsula becomes the original homeland for the traditions of skull carriers. This 
transposition seems to have been as much liturgical as it was mythological, for while in works 
like the Picumata, when the yāga is enacted, Prāyaga is placed in the center of a maṇḍala 
surrounded by eight cremation grounds, materials found within the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya 
seems to assign this place of honor to Somanātha. 
While numerous textual connections exist between our text and the corpus associated 
with the Picumata and its successors, exploring these matters at any length would take us far 
afield from our purpose in the present chapter. For this reason, to substantiate the point at hand, 
paradāraparadravyaparahiṃsāratā narāḥ // udvegaṃ ca paraṃ yāti pratapyanti yas tataḥ / ātmasaṃbhāvitā mūḍā mithyājñānena mohitāḥ // varṇāśramaviruddhaṃ tu tīrthaṃ kurvanti ye’dhamāḥ / 1244The other major frame story offers an entirely novel narrative of how Sarasvatī carried the vāḍavānala fire that will burn up existence at the end of time in her singed hands from the inland to Prabhāsakṣetra by the sea. At the seashore, she released it, at which point it became the subterranean mare that takes refuge in the bottom of the ocean awaiting the end of days. Along with a number of narratives related to Caṇḍeśvara, these materials suggest the presence of a Kārukasiddhānta tradition on the site either concurrent with or preceding the Mahāpāśupata occupation of Somanātha. 
1389 
we will briefly turn to two such self-contained and hitherto undocumented instances. The first 
of these surfaces in the frame narrative that organizes the whole māhātmya, which introduces 
us to the rationale behind Prabhāsakṣetra. Most likely this is because the text as it comes down 
to us—quite close to what Hemādri would have been using—is itself the product of a series of 
redactions, the dominant thread in which seeks to harmonize the materials it inherits with a 
more pointedly Brāhmaṇa friendly Śaiva Siddhānta influenced theology and sensibility. In 
these more often polished portions of the origin story, the liṅga at Someśvara is connected with 
the brahmāṇḍa, and the killing of Brāhmaṇas on its grounds is treated as a terrible sin that 
nonetheless has preoccupied misguided pilgrims in previous ages. In another thread, however, 
Someśvara is unambiguously identified with Bhairava in the form of the fire that consumes the 
world at the end of time and the field he occupies is depicted as emanating yoginīs and housing 
monuments to the Pāśupatavrata and Mahāvrata practicing Śaiva sages of past ages who 
merged into the liṅga. 
It is to this earlier stratum that the following decidedly partial account, entitled by the 
editor of the translation of the vulgate “The Garland of Skulls and Tattvas” most likely belongs. 
In relating yet again the glory of Somanātha, we have just been told that this liṅga was the 
source from which the Garuḍa and Bhūta Tantras emanated and from which the khecarīs first 
emerged.1245 We are also informed that this is one of the main sites in the fields from which 
in each age the Siddhas have emerged to spread their doctrines. After reiterating the close 
association between the Someśvara liṅga and Bhairava in general, but especially the final 
Bhairava Kālāgnirudranātha who will consume this world when it ends, the goddess indulges 
in a seeming non-sequitur that points us in the direction of a much older register of religion. 
1245Skanda Purāṇa 1.9.6: gāruḍam bhūtatantraṃ ca khecaryo vyantarīs tathā / te sarve saha yogena tasmāl liṅgāt samutithatāḥ // 
1390 
“If you are the great lord, the creator who is a treasure house without beginning or end, the cause of creator and dissolution, how is it that you [have] a garland of skulls?” Then, having laughed, the lord of the gods Śaṅkara spoke: “My garland shines forth with crores of skulls beyond counting. It has been made by thousands of the heads of Nārāyaṇas and ten-thousands of Brahmās and thus it is without beginning or end. In every kalpa, another Viṣṇu comes into being, and also another Brahmā. In every kalpa, I create Viṣṇu and Prajāpati. I alone am creator, O goddess. I am established in the field of Prabhāsa at the root of the liṅga of kālāgni, which is adorned with a garland of skulls.1246 
In the text as it comes down to us, the goddess next begins to praise the Lord with a 
stava. The lord is pleased, asks her is she wants a boon. In an obvious interpolation, the 
goddess uses this promise to abruptly shift the entire focus of the discussion entirely away from 
the liṅga and towards Dvārakā, when she demands he recounts how and why did Lord Viṣṇu, 
suddenly praised in exalted terms as the creator and annihilator of the universe and the source 
of the Vedas and the system of varṇa, “cast off his body at Prabhāsa.” In yet further signs that 
the text here is a hodge-podge of influences, Śiva responds by largely ignoring her inquiry. 
Śiva corrects her attribution of higher order values to his lowly rival, and then launches into an 
extended delineation in sequence of the proximity to Somanātha of the sacred centers that make 
1246Skanda Purāṇa: yadi tvaṃ ca mahādevo muṇḍamālā kathaṃ kṛtā / anādinidhano dhātā sṛṣṭisaṃhārakārakaḥ / tato vihasya deveśaḥ śaṅkaro vākyam abravīt / anekamuṇḍakoṭībhir yā me mālā virājate / nārāyaṇasahasrāṇāṃ brahmaṇām ayutasya ca / kṛtā śiraḥkaroṭībhir anādinidhanā tataḥ / anyo viṣṇuś ca bhavati anyo brahmā bhavaty api / kalpe kalpe mayā sṛṣṭaḥ kalpe viṣṇuḥ prajāpatiḥ / aham evaṃvidho devi kṣetre prabhāsike sthitaḥ / kālāgniliṅgamūle tu muṇḍamālāvibhuṣitaḥ / Compare the substance, if not the wording, with the rather damaged portion of the Picumata Brahmayāmala that depicts the arising of the skull, though here it is Brahmā and Viṣṇu themselves who are speaking, where we find strikingly similar imagery. In Hatley’s translation “‘What is this strange form of yours O Lord? What is this adornment? . . . . From whose body comes the ornaments of human (mahā-) bone which shines on you (virājate)?’ I then replied to them with these words of address: ‘This garland on mem which shines with many crores of heads (¿) from the bodies of countless world-lords (bhuvanīśa) is fastened at the time of universal destruction, O Brahmā, [as they are] destroyed over and over again (?). All of the human remains (nārāṇi) placed on my neck, arms, and waist are entirely yours, O Nārāyaṇa.” Shaman Hatley, ed. and trans., The Brahmayāmalatantra or Picumata, Vol. 1, Chapters 1–2, 9–40 and 83 (Volume 1) (Pondicherry: Institut Français d’ Indologie/École française d’ Extrême-Orient, 2018), 487–88. It is interesting to note that the Avantīkhaṇḍa of the Skanda Purāṇa vulgate, which seems to be even older than the Prabhāsa division, in celebrating the performance of the kapālavrata offers a version of the story of the decapitation of Brahmā, the details of which align it with the accounts in both the Picumata and Nepalese Skanda Purāṇa where Viṣṇu slits open his left arm and offers arghya of his own blood into the skull bowl. For details on the Purāṇic sources, see Phyllis Granoff, “Mahākāla’s Journey: From Gaṇa to God,” Rivista Degli Studi Orientali 77, no. 1/4 (2003): 95–114. 
1391 
up Prabhāsakṣetra. As we will see momentarily, this subject, which occupies the vast majority 
of the māhātmya, is precisely the body of materials that Hemādri will draw upon extensively 
but selectively in the service of his own interpretive agenda. 
Our second example, which is found much further into the text, occurs in the discussion 
of the main pīṭha associated with Jñānaśakti at Prabhāsa,1247 who in the current age is called 
Ajā. In introducing this place, Śiva offhandedly remarks that this deity issued forth from his 
sixth mouth, which is perpetually worshipped by Brahmā.1248 The astonished goddess then 
asks Īśvara if there are any more heads he’s been hiding from her, and this is Śiva’s response: 
O Goddess, this question asked by you is a good one. I shall describe to you what should be kept secret even from one’s own sons. It was originally arisen in an Āgama that is not well known. Earlier, from the inception of the Universe, O goddess, I in fact had seven heads. Five are familiar, Sadyojāta and so forth. The sixth is remembered as Ajā. The seventh was named Picu. Thus, I have seven faces. Ajā was given to Brahmā, and the Picuvaktra to Viṣṇu. In this way, O great goddess, now I have become five faced.1249 
As we can see, Śiva alludes to an even more complicated iteration of the Kaula 
cosmology presented by the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā. No sooner has this been introduced, directly 
credited to an obscure āgama (aprasiddhāgamodita), than our text readily and somewhat 
nonsensically assigns such knowledge to the past. The Lord insists into his perplexed wife that 
after his crazy youth he gave away the other weird heads. Nowadays (adhunā), honey, he 
informs us, I have just got the five faces you learn about in school. This is but one of a myriad 
1247One of many competing systematicities in the mahātmya seeks to relate Somanātha himself with his three śaktis, icchā, jñāna, and kriyā. Another connects him with Kālī[sic]saṃkarṣiṇi and still another with Siddhalakṣmī and the mythology of Kolhapur. Clearly there were competing Śākta emplotments of the sacred landscape. 1248Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya, pg. 50, division 55: mama vaktrād viniṣkrāṃtā ṣaṣṭhād vai viṣṇupūjitāt // devy uvāca / pañcavaktrāṇi deveśa prasiddhāni tava prabho / ṣaṣṭhaṃ yad vadanaṃ deva tasya kiṃ nāma saṃsmṛtam // samutpannā kathaṃ tasmād ajādevīti yā śrutā / For another rendition, which offers some distinct readings, see the translation of the vulgate Skanda Purāṇa by “A board of scholars,” chapter 59, 264–65. 1249Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya: sādhu pṛṣṭhaṃ tvayā devi yad gopyaṃ svasuteṣv api / tat te ‘haṃ saṃpravakṣyāmi aprasiddhāgamoditam // vaktrāṇi mama deveśi saptāsan pūrvam eva hi / sadyojātādipañcaiva ṣaṣṭhaṃ smṛtam ajeti ca // saptamaṃ picunāmeti saptaivaṃ vadanāni me / tebhyo ’jaṃ brahmaṇe dattaṃ picuvaktraṃ tu viṣṇave // tasmād ahaṃ mahādevi pañcavaktro ’dhunā ’bhavam / 
1392 
of examples in which the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya distances itself from the most 
“disreputable” aspects of its past. 
The digression we have just been exploring immediately follows another story. In that 
account, we are instructed that in ancient times, at the ritual center associated with kriyā śakti, 
a king incongruously named Ajāpāla venerated Bhairavī to be rid of a debilitating illness. 
When the goddess appears before him, the king is rid of his ailment, which emerges from his 
body in the form of a herd of goats. The king dedicates himself to nurturing and protecting 
these animals until the end of his life, granting the center the name of Ajāpāleśvarī, the goddess 
who protects the goats. In other words, we are deep within in the sort of textual territory where 
the didactic programmatic approach of the Purāṇas bumps up against hyper localized, likely 
vernacular, particularized traditions of storytelling, of the sort one finds among people like the 
Dhangar, where narratives do not always have a clear beginning, middle, and end. It is 
precisely at these seams in the text that we encounter, travelling in tandem in symbiotic 
relationship, the Bhairavasiddhānta or Vāma traditions peeking out from behind a non- 
Brāhmaṇa vernacular. 
In the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya itself, the persistence of this plurality of religious 
registers, where the rougher edges of the most transgressive forms of high Śākta and skull 
carrier traditions are smoothed over but not effaced entirely, becomes most apparent when the 
text interweaves among its catalogue of specific sacred spaces eccentric shaggy dog stories 
providing the background for individual tīrthas, many of which conclude with extended 
discussions of specific practices. For the writers of the māhātmya, however, the incorporation 
of these materials seems to have amounted to a necessary evil, for much of the task that it 
undertakes is dedicated precisely to the relegation of these values to the status of cultural 
1393 
curiosity in favor of mainstreaming a more ecumenical and public Śaivism. Part of the way 
this task is accomplished is through the integration of other mythological registers and 
resources. But, quite unlike what we will find in Hemādri’s interpretive project, in the 
māhātmya, this task is hardly carried out in a systematically supercessionary fashion in the 
service of some simple domestication of the sacred landscape. Instead, what the māhātmya 
itself presents is a hodge-podge of eclectic influences, the most outlandish of which it seeks to 
temper. Somewhat counterintuitively, the best approach to arriving at a solid understanding of 
how Hemādri programmatically intervenes into this landscape and reworks its imaginary is 
acquired by attending to an extended portion of the Tīrthakhaṇḍa of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi 
where our śrīkaraṇeśvara dedicates a number of folios to citing from the māhātmya almost in 
sequence and virtually verbatim. In contrast to the in some ways more tantalizing sections of 
the Tīrthakhaṇḍa where Hemādri draws upon Purāṇic source materials that are quite distinct 
from our published texts or describes less familiar sacred sites of unknown provenance, our 
archive here enables us to differentiate between the interpretive work being enacted by the 
Purāṇas themselves and conceptual project of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi. In short, it enables us 
to make solid judgements about what is new and different about our nibandha. As we shall 
see, there is a definite pattern in what our author elides and the rhetorical impact of these 
decisions. The section we will be briefly surveying (comprised of chapters 123–165 in the 
vulgate), deals mostly with minor sites on the outer orbit of the main liṅga. Over the course of 
this part of the māhātmya, forty-three sites are discussed, several of them in great detail.1250 In 
1250The material covered by the Vulgate runs as follows: Citrāṅgadeśvara, Rāvaneśvara, Saubhāgyeśvarī, Paulomīśvara, Śāṇḍilyeśvara, Kṣemaṅkareśvara, Sāgarāditya, Ugraseneśvara, Pāśupateśvara, Dhruveśvara, 
1394 
the vulgate, the chapters vary enormously in size, from three or four verses to a hundred verses 
in length. Almost every chapter commences with fixed formulas, most commonly “then, O 
great goddess, one should go to. . .” (tato gacchen mahādevi) followed by either the name of 
the site or the distance, measured in bow lengths from the previous site that has just been 
presented. In this same verse, we are then introduced to a dramatic persona, generally a Vedic 
sage, a supernatural creature, a king, or a god. We learn that this figure prayed or performed 
austerities at the site and then the rewards he or she received, and perhaps a short summary of 
site-specific practices, are then defined. For example, in the first stop on our itinerary,1251 
delineated in a mere four verses, we learn that at Citrāṅgadeveśvara, twenty bow lengths to 
the south-west of the previous site, a Gandharva named Citrāṅgada performed austerities 
before a liṅga. Those who follow in his footsteps will attain the world of the gandharvas. In 
Siddhalakṣmī, Mahākālī, Puṣkarāvartakā, Śitalagaurī, Lomaśeśvara, Kaṅkālabhairava, Tṛṇabindiśvara, Citrāditya, Citrapathā, Kapardīcintāmaṇi, Citreśvara, Vicitreśvara, Puṣkara-kuṇḍa, Gajakuṃbhodara, Yameśvara, Brahmakuṇḍa, Kuṇḍalakūpa, Bhairaveśvara, Brahmeśvara, Sāvtrīśvara Bhairava, Nāradeśvara Bhairava, Hiraṇyeśvara, Gāyatrīśvara, Ratneśvara, Garuḍeśvara, Satyabhāmeśvara, Anaṅgeśvara, Ratneśvara, Raivantakarāja, Ananteśvara, Aṣṭakuleśvara, Nāstyeśvara, Aśvineśvara, Sāvitrī, Sāvitrīpaddhati, Bhūtamātṛkā. 
Hemādri in contrast discusses the following sites in sequence (bearing in mind the manuscript has been carelessly copied) under the following names, Citrāṅgadeśvara, Rāvaneśvara, Gaurīsaubhāgyadāyinī, Śāṇḍilyeśvara, Kṣemeśvaram, Akṣamāleśvara, Pāśupateśvaram, Dhruveśvara, Vaiṣṇavīśakti, Mahākālī, Puṣkarāvarttaka, Gaurīduḥkhāntakāriṇī, Citrādityeśvara, Tṛṇavidīśvara, [manuscripts damage], Vighneśa, Dharmarāja, Kūpakuṇḍaleśvara, Bhairaveśvara, Nāradeśvara, Hiraṇyeśvara, Brahamkuṇḍa, Ratneśvara, Vainateya, Satyabhāmeśvara, Ratnakuṇḍeśa, Rājabhaṭṭāraka Raivantaka, Vaivasvateśvara, Kuntīśvara, Mātṛgaṇa- ekavallavīrā. 1251Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya: tato gacchen mahādevi liṅgaṃ citrāṅgadeśvaram / tasyaiva nairṛte bhāge dhanurviṃśātibhiḥ sthitaṃ // citrāṅgadena deveśi gandharvapatinā priye / kṣetraṃ pavitraṃ jñātvā vai liṅgaṃ tatra pratiṣṭhitam // kṛtvā tapo mahāghoraṃ samārādhya maheśvaram / atha yo bhāvasaṃyuktas talliṅgaṃ saṃprapūjayet // gandharvalokam āpnoti gandharvair saha modate / tatra śuklatrayodaśyāṃ saṃsnāpya vidhinā śivam // pūjayed dvividhaiḥ puṣpair gandhadhūpair anukramāt / sa prāpnoty akhilaṃ kāmām manasā yady adīpsitam // p.70 
Transcribed free from any corrections, here the Tīrthakhaṇḍa reads: tato gacchen mahādevi liṅgaṃ citrāṅgadeśvaram / tasyaiva [bharaiṣyat] bhāge dhanurviṃśātibhisthitaṃ / citrāṅgadena deveśi gandharvapatināpriye kṣetraṃ / pavitraṃ jñātvā vai liṅgaṃ tatra pratiṣṭhitam kṛtvā tapo mahāghoraṃ samārādhya maheśvaram / atha yo bhāvasaṃyuktas talliṅgaṃ saṃprapūjayet / gandharvalokam āpnoti gandharvair saha modate / caitraśuklacaturdaśyāṃ saṃsnāpya vidhinā śivam / pūjayed dvividhaiḥ puṣpai gandhadhūpair anukramāt / saṃprāpnoty akhilaṃ kāmām manasā yady adīkṣitaṃ While some of these differences result from minor corruptions, two readings in the Tīrthakhaṇḍa, which offer a different date and specify a non-Tantric initiate are likely worth considering. 
1395 
his Tīrthakhaṇḍa, Hemādri leaves virtually all of these postage stamp size itineraries virtually 
intact just as they are given. Such passages, from our authors perspective, in fact represent 
exempla for what a tīrtha text should look and sound like, for as we shall see, Hemādri takes 
the chapters in his sources that do not fit easily within this formula and heavily redacts them 
so that they assume a similar shape and texture. 
Thus, for example, Hemādri’s fealty to the māhātmya’s treatment of Citrāṅgadeveśvara 
stands in considerable contrast to his vivisection of the chapter that immediately follows, which 
is dedicated to the tīrtha center of Rāvaneśvara.1252 As its name already suggests, Rāvaṇeśvara 
1252The vulgate in this section offers 25 verses. Passages shared with the Tīrthakhaṇḍa are marked in bold below. This story is presented toto so that the reader can examine a concrete example of Hemādri’s redaction process while checking it against the original text. For all other examples in the following sections, the reader will simply be directed to the relevant pages in the vulgate Skanda Purāṇa and is invited to consult them at their leisure.

was remembered as a liṅga consecrated by the demon king Rāvaṇa. After the opening verse, 
the vulgate in this case breaks from the formula by telling an elaborate story. One day Rāvaṇa 
was out flying in his magical chariot when he encountered an invisible force field blocking his 
way. Astounded, Rāvaṇa descended from the heavens, where he encounters someone named 
Prahasta. This sage informs him about the greatness of Someśvara and that it cannot be passed 
over by anyone. Descending from his chariot, Rāvaṇa makes pilgrimage to Someśa and 
innocently sets out to worship the liṅga along with his Rākṣasa followers. The mere presence 
of all of these demons, however devoted they might have been, rather understandably scares 
away all the other pilgrims. As it so happens, a festival is approaching, when throngs of people 
are supposed to celebrate at Somanātha, but no one wants to come so long as the demons 
remain. To protect his other devotees, the voice of Someśa comes out of the liṅga. Thanking 
Rāvaṇa for his devotion, it suggests that he remove himself to a more obscure location for the 
festival season so that other bhaktas can come and pay the liṅga homage. Rāvaṇa agrees, 
retreats to a cave, and it is there that he installs the current liṅga that bears his name. At least, 
that is what happens in the root text. In Hemādri’s rendition, in contrast, all but the first verse 
and last seven verses of this twenty-five-verse text have been excised. We lose the whole story 
and the whole discussion of appropriate practices. What we are left with, then, is only the 
introduction to the place, Rāvaṇa’s program of worship (which is not to be emulated), and its 
supposed benefits. In fact, we know for certain that Hemādri’s source text looked quite bit like 
our vulgate, which is to say it travelled with the story, because his nibandha has incongruously 
retained a small portion of the text where the voice comes out of the liṅga. With the tale 
sannihito nityaṃ [sthāsyamp] aham asaṃśayaḥ / yaiḥ caitapūjayiṣyeti śatrūṇāṃ rākṣaseśvaraḥ // yāsyanti paramāṃ siddhiṃ matprasādād aśaṃśayaḥ / evam uktvā vararohe virarāma vṛṣabhadhvajaḥ // rāvaṇe ’pi sa saṃtuṣṭo bhūyo bhūyo maheśvaraḥ / pūjayitvā tu talliṅgaṃ samārudya tu puṣpalaikaṃ // trailokyavijayākāṅkṣī iṣṭadeśaṃ jagāmaha / 
1397excised, the liṅga, whose identity is nowhere made apparent, for no apparent reason speaks in 
the first person to Rāvaṇa and tells him to go to the cave and install another liṅga. 
Apart from some minor differences in the naming of the sites, the next four chapters, 
all terse and formulaic and thus matching Hemādri’s expectations, are retained nearly 
verbatim. It is only when we get to Sāgarāditya and Ugraseneśvara, both of which offer 
extended narrative and didactic materials (twenty-four verses in the first instance and fifty- 
three in the second) that the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya as it is retained in the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi again undergoes major emendations. In the first instance, Hemādri 
simply inserts the first three verses introducing the site,1253 while in the second he includes the 
first three and last three verses.1254 The result rhetorically is that two very different sorts of 
places, one associated with the worship of a sun god and the other with a tale about an 
encounter between a king and a Dalit, are rendered almost interchangeable and, from our 
perspective, equally uninteresting. 
Our next chapter, eighty-two verses long in the vulgate, takes us to Pāśupateśvara, a 
site associated with the Mahāpāśupatas.1255 In the vulgate, after an unusually long introduction 
1253In the vulgate Skanda Purāṇa, these two tales occupy page 52 and part of 53. The Tīrthakhaṇḍa here simply reads: īśvara uvāca / tato gacchen mahādevi sāgarādityam uttamam / bhairaveśāt paścimato rudrān mṛtyuñjayāt tathā // kāmeśadakṣiṇāgneyanātidūre vyavasthitam / sarvarogapraśamanaṃ daridrau ‘dya vināśanam // pratiṣṭitam mahādevi sagareṇa mahātmanā / jñātvā śaivaṃ mahākṣetraṃ prabhāsaṃ pāpanāśanam // 1254In the vulgate Skanda Purāṇa, this tale, which is largely about Caṇḍāleśvara and the Caṇḍāla that gives the place its name, occupies half a page. In the Tīrthakhaṇḍa we are simply told the following: ugraseneśvaraṃ nāmakhyātaṃ tasyaiva sāṃpratam / pāpaghnaṃ sarvajantūnāṃ darśanasya sparśanād api // brahmahatyāsurāpānam steyaṃ gurvanganāgamaḥ / mahāntipātakāny evaṃ naśyante tasya darśānāt // tatraiva ṛṣipacamyāṃ bhāse bhādrapade śubhe/ 1255In the vulgate Skanda Purāṇa, the Pāśupateśvara episode occupies most of pages 53–54. Hemādri’s version runs as follows: tato gacchen mahādevi devapāśupateśvaram / ugraseneśvarād devi pūrvabhāge vyavasthitam // saṃtuṣṭo bhagavān yasmāt teṣāṃ tatra tapasvināṃ / tena santoṣanāmnā tu prakhyātaṃ dharaṇītale // yuge liṅgaṃ mahādevi siddhisthānaṃ mahāprabham / gopyādityāt tathāgneye ye dhruveśād dakṣiṇāśritaṃ // sarvapāpaharaṃ liṅgaṃ darśanāt sarvakāmadam / asmin yuge samākhyātaṃ tat santoṣeśvara[ṃ] priye // priyaṃ pāśupatānāṃ ca bheṣajaṃ pāparogiṇā[m] / catvāro munayaḥ siddhā anādīśe nirañjane // asya liṅgasya sāmīpye vana[ṃ] śrīmukhasaṃsthitam / lakṣmīsthānaṃ mahādevi yogasiddhais tu sevitaṃ // tatra pāśupatāḥ śreṣṭhā mama liṅgārcane ratāḥ / teṣāṃ caiva nivāsārtha[ṃ] taddevyā nirmitam vanam // tasya madhye tu suśroṇi liṅgapūrvamukhaṃ sthitaṃ / tasmin pāśupatāḥ siddhā aghorādyā maharṣayaḥ // anenaiva prakāreṇa gatās te 
1398 
to this abode of the siddhas, we are offered a long narrative discussing the circumstances under 
which the previously wild rites associated with the Pāśupatavrata were “reformed” and 
replaced by a more pacific vow of simply bathing in ash from the fire while anointing the body 
with more Vaidika mantras. It seems that in a past age, both Nandin and the Goddess came to 
a place where the siddhas were engaged in their all-consuming praxis. Instead of treating them 
as guests, the Pāśupata siddhas were so absorbed in their austerities and meditation that they 
did not even notice the presence of any other deities. The goddess, annoyed, bothers her 
husband. Śiva explains that the siddhas will not even look at her because she is prakṛti 
incarnate. Enraged, the goddess curses the Pāśupatas, saying that in the kali yuga they will 
become obsessed with receiving gifts from kings and with the bodies of beautiful women. In 
the kali age, we learn as this section of the māhātmya concludes, the Pāśupatavrata has been 
redefined to begin and end with the ash bath and it is to be practiced only by Brāhmaṇas. 
Apparently, this was an important place, for Hemādri makes a point of retaining fifteen verses, 
introducing the siddhas who worship the liṅga. By simply culling at all references to specific 
Śaiva practices, the siddhas in question, though still called Pāśupatas, can be depicted as 
Brāhmaṇa ascetics (tapasvin) who observe celibacy, (brahmacarya) have conquered their 
anger (jitakrodha), and are peaceful (śānta) and self-disciplined (dānta). In other words, apart 
from their use of the aghora mantra, through selective editing Hemādri renders them all but 
indistinguishable from any of a number of other kinds of yogins. As for the long story about 
śivamandiraṃ / tatra prābhāsīke kṣetre surasiddhaniṣevite // rocate me sadā vāsas tasmin[n] āyat[a]ne śubhe / sarveṣām eva sthānānāṃ atiramyamunipriyaṃ // tata pāśupatā devi mama dhyānaparāyaṇāḥ / mama putrās tu te sarve brahmacaryeṇa samyutāḥ // śāntā dāntā jitakrodhā brāhmaṇās te tapasvinaḥ / tasya liṅgaṃ prabhāvena siddhi[ṃ] te paramāṃ gatāḥ // tasmāt taṃ pūjayen nityaṃ kṣetravāsī dvijottama[ḥ] / tapaḥ paramadāruṇaṃ divyavarṣasahasram tu // pratiṣṭhāpya maheśvaram saṃpūjyati sadbhaktyā / stautiḥ stotraiḥ pṛthagvidhaiḥ iti yat prārthitaṃ devi // 
1399 
the Pāśupatavrata in any of its forms, it is simply erased, reduced from a practice to a mere 
narrative trope. 
It is important here to note that on a certain level Hemādri and his source material are 
effectively in agreement that the purpose behind writing a pilgrimage manual is an exercise in 
desotericization and domestication. Indeed, in some sense, the very idea of writing a 
comprehensive guide within a given landscape to all the sacred sites, including the very secret 
ones, so that anyone can access them intrinsically amounts to an assault upon the more 
capacious vision of a differentiation of domains with their own site-specific norms. But 
whereas the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya seeks to mitigate the extremity of praxis evident at 
some of these places, the Caturvargacintāmaṇi seeks to narrow and flatten the landscape and 
appropriate its power centers into its conceptual framework. This later dimension of the 
nibandha becomes most apparent when it comes to the rather different way it treats the 
goddesses discussed in this portion of the text. In the vicinity of Pāśupateśvara we find three 
such entitles, which in the vulgate are labelled Siddhalakṣmī, Mahākālī, and Śītalāgaurī. As 
we will see momentarily, two additional female deities, Sāvitrī and Bhūtamātā, and her special 
festival, are discussed in an elaborate fashion near the very end of this internal subdivision of 
the māhātmya. For the scholar of Tantra, the confirmation that this portion of the māhātmya is 
at least as old as the mid-twelfth century is invaluable, for it establishes for the first time 
concretely and unambiguously the concurrent co-presence operating at precisely the same 
moment in history of three discrete strategies for normalizing and domesticating high Śākta 
traditions. Let us begin with the most important of the sites, the place that is probably the 
historical Kāmarūpa. 
Then, O great goddess, one should go to the supreme Vaiṣṇavī Śakti who is established not very far away in the eastern portion of Someśa. The foremost deity of the 
1400 
kṣetrapīṭha is called Mahālakṣmī. The primordial pīṭha, the egg of Brahmā is established differentially in Prabhāsa. 
There, O goddess, are yoginīs with great bodies, who go about in the sky making the sound śū. They have dalliances with Bhairava and they play (krīḍā) according to their desire, O beloved. Jalandhara, Pūrṇagiri, and likewise Kāmarūpa. The supreme fourth pīṭha is known of as Auspicious Uddīśa [here follows a very corrupt list of sacred sites]. . . . 
Of all the pīṭhas, the chief supreme one is in Saurastra. O supreme goddess, it is called Mahodaya, known by the name of the great goddess. In the Lāṭa country, it is the foundation, Kāmarūpa, which is in operation even today. 
The goddess who has three forms is established in the pīṭhas. She is known of as Mahālakṣmī. She is the auspicious one who pacifies all sin and bestows all desires. Lakṣmī belongs as well to the man who should worship her on the auspicious fifth day, according to injunction, with devotion, with flowers and fragrances.1256 
There are strong indications that the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya’s representation of this 
primordial pīṭha does not merely offer a secondhand depiction of an until now overlooked but 
nonetheless integral Kaula ritual center dedicated to the melana with the yoginīs. It is indeed 
highly likely that the text is actively drawing upon a now lost Śākta scriptural source. 
Especially in Hemādri’s edit of the text, which excises some particular narrative and ritual 
details, what is most striking here is the dichotomy between the unapologetically high Śākta 
nature of the sacred center and the banal and basic practices—flowers, devotion, and incense— 
to be used in worship,1257 which our text says can be equally effectively wielded by any person. 
1256Hemādri, Tīrthakhaṇḍa: īśvara uvāca / tato gacchen mahādevi vaiṣṇavīśaktim uttamām / someśād īśādibhāge nātidūre vyavasthitām // mahālakṣmīti vikhyātāṃ kṣetrapīṭhādidevatām / brahmāṇḍaṃ prathamaṃ pīṭhaṃ yatprabhāse vyavasthitam // tatra devi mahākāyā yoginyaḥ śūkarāḥ khagā / bhairaveṇa sametās tu krīḍanti svecchayā priye // jālandharaṃ pūrṇagāraṃ kāmarūpaṃ tathaiva ca / śrīmaduddīśāsaṃjataṃ caturthaṃ pīṭham uttamam // kairātaṃ[kāravīraṃ?] ca mahāpīṭhaṃ saivalaṃ[emd. śrīśailam] pīṭha[m] uttamam / gangāsthaṃ ca mahāpīṭhaṃ piśācī piṭham uttamam // [prayāga]ratnavīryaṃ[gīryaṃ?] mahāpīṭhaṃ kā[ś]mīratīrtham uttamam / etāni devapiṭhāni yo meti [emd. vetti] sa ca me ‘bhavat // sarveṣāṃ caiva pīṭhānāṃ pradhānaṃ pīṭham uttamam / saurāṣṭre tu mahādevināmnākhyātaṃ mahodayam // kāmarūpādhāraṃ lāṭe yatrādyāpi pravarttate / trayī pīṭhasthitā devī mahālakṣmīr iti śrutā // sarvapāpapraśamanī sarvakāmapradā śubhā / śrīpañcamyāṃ naro yas tu pūjayet tām vidhānat[a]ḥ // gandhapuṣpādibhir bhaktyā tasyāḥ lakṣmīḥ svayaṃk[ṛ]t[ā] / 1257In the vulgate in contrast, this whole section, which is otherwise actually compressed and contains less explicit Śākta material, is dedicated to the worship of the goddess Siddhalakṣmī. Though the text does seem to delineate what such a rite would entail, it proposes that, following dīkṣā, the practitioner is to perform a homa using what is called the “peaks of mantras” (mantraśikhā) which is identified with Siddhilakṣmī. Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya: 
1401 
In other words, both the māhātmya, but especially Hemādri, at least on paper, appropriate the 
space at the very same moment they are undercutting its sociology of knowledge. It is entirely 
possible that a phrase like “according to injunction” (yathāvidhi) was already present in the 
older source material. In that context, however, it almost certainly would have referred to a 
special mode of praxis outlined elsewhere in the Tantra involving the use of transgressive 
substances and that could only be accessed through modes of initiation that entailed direct 
possession by terrifying Śākta deities. Once it is repurposed and then re-embedded within a 
litany of other sacred sites belonging to diverse traditions with their own internal criteria for 
initiation into distinctive ritual systems, many of which happen also to deploy in their texts the 
common phrase according to injunction (yathāvidhi), in each case intending a different vidhi, 
something extraordinary seems to happen. Even without the added impact of Hemādri’s 
judicious edits removing tradition specific doctrinal and ritual materials, on the surface, it looks 
like all of the texts are directing their reader back to a commonly shared set of procedural “best 
practices” for performing worship. As we will explore in much more depth in the middle of 
this chapter, the Caturvargacintāmaṇi harnesses this emergent intertextual property and 
transforms it into deliberate strategy for harmonizing the totality of available scriptural 
resources in the service of making them seem to speak with a single voice. 
From Kāmarūpa, we next journey to a subterranean structure in a connected field that 
is dedicated to Mahākālī. In the māhātmya, it is prescribed that she is to be worshipped at 
midnight on the eighth day of the dark half of the moon with offerings of meat (kravya) and 
some sort of liquid. The text then goes onto to discuss a special fast that women can perform 
yojayen mantraśikhāṃ siddhilakṣmīti viśrutām / lakṣajāpyavidhānena dīkṣāsaṃsthānapūrvakam // Here it is worth noting that in a Siddhilakṣmīvidhāna preserved in Nepal, ascribed to the second division of the Jayadrathayāmala, mention is made of a variation on the navātman mantra that is called the śikhā mantra, “sa+ha+ra-kṣa-ma-la-va,” which is to be conjoined with the navākṣarī mantra of Siddhilakṣmī. 
1402 
to ensure that they always have food to feed their families. In Hemādri, in contrast,1258 the first 
ritual procedure is replaced by a terse reference that the ritual is to be executed according to 
the procedure for worshipping the goddess (devīpūjyavidhānataḥ). While the fast and its 
consequences are retained, Hemādri either interpolates in new material or adds his own bit of 
commentary. In a place where his source had referred in passing to the Mahākālīvrata, Hemādri 
interjects, “what is called Mahākālīvrata has as its intended meaning the supreme 
Devīmāhātmya.” As we will see again when we turn to the Vratakhaṇḍa, though we have no 
way of determining if such efforts are his own innovation, Hemādri offers us our earliest 
historicizeable moment in the reception history of the Devīmāhātmya where the text is 
deployed in the manner most familiar to scholars of Hindu traditions in both the Western and 
Indian academy, namely, as framework for appropriating and taming “local” and esoteric 
traditions of goddess worship under the auspices of the worship of “the great goddess” wedded 
to royal power and shaped by non-Śrauta Brāhmaṇas. Dwelling so close to the pīṭha of 
Kāmarūpa dedicated to the melana, it very likely that the Mahākālī in question would have 
been linked to pre-philosophical forms of the Krama of the sort promulgated by the 
Jayadrathayāmala, for we have other sites slightly further afield where some of the monikers 
1258Here we have serious probably unresolveable textual problems, some of which may be “authorial.” I reproduce the text simply so the reader can have a taste of the type of wholesale domestication of source material, coherency be damned, in which our author engages in the service of eliding transgressive inherited Śākta materials. Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Tīrthakhaṇḍa: tatraiva saṃsthitā devi mahākālīti viśrutā / adha[ḥ]sthitā mahāpīṭhe pātālavivarānvite // sarvaduḥkhapraśamanī sarvaśatrukṣayaṅkarī / pūjitā [words missing] dhanina kṛṣṇāṣṭamyāṃ mahāniśi // puṣpadhūpais tathā dīpair navaidyair [ba]libhis tathā / phalatṛtīyaṃ yā nārī kurute tatra bhāvitā // varṣam ekaṃ site pakṣe devīpūjyavidhānataḥ / phalāni brāhmaṇe dadyā[t] kuryā[t] bhaktaṃ vidhānataḥ // etāni virjjayet nakte annāni surasundari / [damaged line] surasundarī niṣpāvā āḍikīmudāmāṣāś(?) // niṣpāva-āṭakī- mudgā-māṣāś caiva kulatthakāḥ / masūrārājamākhāś(?) ca godhūmāś tripuṭās tathā // caṇakāvartulāvā pi makuṣṭāś caiva vamādayaḥ / tāvan na bhakṣayed devi yāvad gaurīvratam caret // tasyāḥ puṇyaphalaṃ vakṣye kathyamānam śṛṇuṣva me / dhanaṃ dhāṇyaṃ gṛhe tasyā na kadācit kṣayaṃ vrajet // duḥkhitā durbhagādīnāṃ saptajanmani no bhavet / mahākālīvrataṃ proktaṃ devyāḥ māhātmyam uttamam // kṛte pātakanāya[ṃ] sarve kāmasamṛddhaye / evaṃ devi samākhyātaṃ mahākālī mahodayaṃ // kṣetrapīṭhaṃ mahādevi mantrasiddhipradāyakam / aśvayuk śuklapakṣe tu navamyāṃ tatra jāgṛyāt // pūṭha[emd. pūta]pūjābaliṃ datvā mantrakalpa[ṃ] japen niśi / saumyacinttaṃ samāpnoti vāñcchitaṃ siddhiṃ uttamam // 
1403 
assigned to Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī make cameo appearances. Just as, through judicious editing, the 
Mahāpāśupatas have been rendered indistinguishable from other ascetics in their observances, 
in much the same way high, Śākta adepts have been rewritten as mere performers of the same 
calendrically determined observances practiced by ordinary people. In this way, just as the 
secret places has become conflated with everyday religion, the gaping divide between the 
razor’s edge path of virtuoso adepts and occasional religion is forcibly fissured shut. 
The case of the last of the three goddesses, situated in close proximity near the field of 
Kāmarūpa, is somewhat different in its dynamics from what we have just been exploring. Here, 
Hemādri makes no adjustment to source material, for the text has already been adequately 
reshaped by the authors of the māhātmya in a manner that serves his interests. The māhātmya 
seems already to have taken a deity of Atimārga associated with salvific functions and demoted 
her into a “localized” goddess who brings disease. This entity was once called 
Gaurīduḥkāntakāriṇī, a name that suggests in essence an apotheosis of the key Pāśupata 
commitment of bringing about an end to the suffering brought about by transmigration. Recast 
in this humbler register, this same entity becomes the goddess Śītalā, at once the cause of 
smallpox and, prior to vaccination, the sole source for a cure. 
Previously, in the age called dvāpara, she was known of as Śītalā. In the kali age, however, the goddess is again called the ender of suffering, since she, being always worshipped, enacts the end of the suffering of the living beings. When she is worshiped with a state of devotion, for the sake of suppressing smallpox pustules of children, she will make the bodies of the children cool and free from disease, and so she is called Śītalā. Smallpox pustules, boils, and the inner winds will be calmed. When Śītalā is worshipped with devotion, children will be pacified and free from disease. Śrāddha should be performed there, and then Brāhmaṇas should be fed.1259 
1259Hemādri, Tīrthakhaṇḍa: tatraiva saṃsthitāṃ paśyed gaurī[ṃ] duḥkhāntakāriṇī[ṃ] / tena devi samākhyātā kāl[ī] duḥkhāntakāriṇī // śītaleti purākhyātāṃ yuge dvāparasaṃjñake / kal[au] punaḥ samākhyātā devi duḥkhāntakāriṇī // duḥkhāntaṃ kurute yasmāt prāṇināṃ pūjitā sadā / śītalaṃ kurute dehaṃ bālānāṃ rogavarjitam // pūjitā bhaktibhāvena tena sā śītalā smṛtā / visphoṭānāṃ praśāntyarthaṃ bālānāṃ caiva kāraṇaṃ // visphoṭāś carcikā kuṣṭhaṃ vātādīnāṃ śamam bhavet / śītalām arcayed bhaktyā bālā[ḥ] santinirāmayā[ḥ] // śrāddhaṃ tatraiva kurvīta brāhmaṇ[ān] tatra bhojayet / 
1404 
This short passage probably contains the earliest reliably dateable allusion to the 
goddess of smallpox that has been discovered thus far. It is thus particularly interesting that it 
comes to us complete with the range of competing dynamics that define the much better 
documented later traditions, including the interplay between the heightened emotional states 
of the desperate worshippers and the attempts to bookend such a visceral vision of religion 
with canonical “Brāhmaṇa” social practices, such as śrāddha rites and the feeding of 
Brāhmaṇas. At the same time, we can also see in the textual record what is already evident for 
both the anthropologist travelling throughout the Deccan and the epigrapher working with 
documentary records that take non-court-based goddess worship as their focus, namely, that 
the cults of transregional deities linked with disease like Mārī, Kālubaī, and the village goddess 
Mahālakṣmī, who are focuses of veneration particularly for scheduled caste and OBC 
communities, are built on top of “elite” esoteric Śākta networks and retain within them 
fragments of these traditions. 
Where the Caturvargacintāmaṇi exercises its most consequential reevaluation of this 
somewhat inconsequential section of the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya is in regard to the longest 
portions of the text. These are the Brahmākuṇḍa Māhātmya, the Sāvitri kathā and paddhati, 
and the utsava for Bhūtamātā. In the māhātmya, the Brahmākuṇḍa1260 is lovingly characterized 
as a place where the water flows with the stuff of Siddharasāyana (vs. 12) so that the 
practitioner who comes to this hidden place can easily attain a variety of secular and sacred 
aims.1261 Indeed, there is even said to be a special portion of the tīrtha designated for the 
alchemists to bury their pots in the ground and to set up their crucibles for performing the work 
1260The Brahmākuṇḍa is comprised of 79 verses in the vulgate Skanda Purāṇa and runs from page 77–78. 1261Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya, Brahmākuṇḍa Māhātmya: siddhaṃ rasāyanaṃ devi tatra vai hy udakaṃ priye / nānāvarṇasamāyuktam upadeśena siddhyati // 
1405 
of transmutation. The pilgrim is advised to attend to the color and the smell of the liquids that 
pour forth through the different channels in the ground, as each is suited to a different 
purpose.1262 While some are fit for the conversion of silver or other precious metals into gold, 
others facilitate the cultivation over a period of three years of a divine body. Still others, where 
the current connects them to the fields of Sarasvatī in both her pacific form and as the 
vāḍavānala fire, are certain to bring the alchemist great wisdom and scriptural knowledge. In 
a glimpse of the social world of the practicing alchemist that aligns such figures very closely 
with Kālamukhas of the central Deccan, such a person, we are told, is erudite when it comes 
into śāstra and has mastered both the practice and pedagogy of the Tantric knowledge system 
and is the designated recipient for acts of dāna: 
By the power of this tīrtha, they1263 become skilled in all the śāstras. The [enemy] pandits have become proud, skilled in the śāstras of logic. They go about in common with their noses in the air, dear one. They are not able to speak to or even look at the face [of one who has been to the tīrtha], and he destroys a thousand disputants by a mere glance. He conveys the śāstras quickly that have the meaning [assigned to them] by the wise: the Vimala, Pañcarātra, Śaiva, and Vaiṣṇava, Bhūta Tantras, Gāruḍa Tantras, the Mahābhairava Tantras and the twofold Kulamārga. 
With the speed of the best of chariots, the speech [of enemies] will become utterly erratic, All disputants are destroyed, just like the snakes by Garuḍa. There is no poverty, no sickness, no suffering of the mind. He will become honored by kings [with a grant] and highly respected by the favor of the Brahmā[kuṇḍa]. With cunning mind, he will live like a god, equipped with power and vigor. From the favor of the tīrtha, he will become the agent of philanthropy, the bearer of all rights [over the use of property] and eloquent.1264 
1262See Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya, Brahmākuṇḍa Māhātmya, vs. 32–48. 1263This passage has many variations, all of which have grammatical and agreement issues. Given the rest of this text, the subject here should in the singular. 1264Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya, Brahmākuṇḍa Māhātmya: tīrthasyāsya prabhāveṇa sarvaśāstraviśāradāḥ / paṇḍitāḥ garvitāḥ sarve tarkaśāstraviśāradāḥ // āgacchanti samaṃ tāta vidyayoddhatakandharāḥ / na śaknuvanti te vaktuṃ draṣṭuṃ vaktram api priye // vādinām ca sahasrāṇi bhanakty evaṃ nirīkṣaṇāt // udvāhayati śāstrāṇi vibudhārthāni satvaram / vimalaṃ pāñcarātraṃ ca vaiṣṇavaṃ śaivam eva ca // itihāsapurāṇaṃ ca bhūtatantraṃ ca gāruḍam / bhairavaṃ ca mahātantraṃ kulamārgaṃ dvidhā priye // rathapravaravegena vāṇī cāskhalitā bhavet / naśyanti vādinaḥ sarve garuḍasyeva pannagāḥ // na dāridryaṃ na rogaś ca na duḥkhaṃ mānasaṃ punaḥ / rājamānyo mahāmānī bhaved brahmaprasādataḥ // utsāhabalasamyukto devavaj jīvate sudhīḥ / dātā bhoktā ca vāgmī ca tīrthasyāsya prasādataḥ //

Just as we saw happening on the ground at Uttaṅkeśvara, where the landscape provides 
us with every indication that before it was reimagined under the Seuṇa Yādavas, we were also 
dealing with a place dedicated to alchemical practice, within the textual environs of the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi, the fascinating and richly rendered Brahmākuṇḍa is much reduced into 
what our author calls the “condensed version of what was spoken in the brahmākuṇḍa 
māhātmya” (samkṣepataḥ proktaṃ māhātmyaṃ brahmākuṇḍaṃ). At Hemādri’s direction, we 
are simply presented with its location, a passing allusion to rasāyana, as well as a brief 
reference to an old affiliation with Brahmā, and then it is onward to the next destination. All 
the pointedly Śākta materials that cannot be readily assimilated into Smārta normativities as 
well as the narrative have been scrapped out. 
As for Sāvitrī and Bhūtamātā, they suffer a somewhat different fate. Though reduced 
to brief allusions within the Tīrthakhaṇḍa, the textual passages dedicated to their worship are 
extracted from the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s division on tīrtha and transposed into the division 
on vrata with which the nibandha opens, where they appear in an abridged and transmuted 
form. Especially with regards to the tale of Sāvitrī, who is said to be fully present in the world 
only at a single spot to the northeast of Somanātha, in the original text, praxis, occasion, and 
place were treated as inextricable. Throughout the Vratakhaṇḍa, in contrast, by excising every 
mention of a specific place from his text, Hemādri methodically decouples place from practice. 
In keeping with the wider logic of the Sanskrit cosmopolis, practices become infinitely 
spatially transposable. The observance of vows aligned with these goddesses are now governed 
entirely by calendrical concerns. The vow as an institution is yoked to a specific point in the 
year and it is to be experienced in succession with a range of other “common” holidays. Most 
of these celebrations, which are for the first time beginning to resemble the “modern” Hindu 
1407calendar, from the perspective of the historian of religion have also been also extracted out of 
what were previously theologically specific contexts. Whereas before they were pertinent only 
to particular religious communities, and took place on a staggered schedule, now they are made 
to coexist within a uniform time that governs all people equally. As will become apparent, 
when we set out to historicize the interpretive project of the Vratakhaṇḍa, this is a process for 
which we have minimal evidence anywhere in South Asia before the twelfth century. 
This postulation of a neutral, all-inclusive time as the chief schematic for ordering 
religious practice is also a framework evocative of a set of values essentially antithetical to the 
world of the sovereign akṣayavṛtti. As we saw in chapter 6, within an eternal land grant—the 
institutional building block that organized the early medieval Deccan—the most important 
festival occasion was the five-day celebration of the precise moment in historical time when 
the space became sovereign. In becoming sovereign, in both theological and social terms, the 
undying land grant was transmuted into an institution capable of bestowing grace and concrete 
favor. During these five-day festivals, there was a substantive redistribution of food and wealth 
that had a concrete social and economic impact on the population across the region. Festivals 
such as these were also the central occasion when merchants from across the Deccan assembled 
adjacent to the temples and made exchanges with each other and hawked their products to the 
public. And they were when many key taxes and tariffs were to be paid by residents of the land 
grant. In essence, in a pre-capitalist society, they were partially constitutive of what we might 
call “the business cycle.” Since the precise dates for the founding of each “undying land grant,” 
though connected to a finite set of auspicious astrological conjunctions, would have varied 
substantially, distinctive “religious communities” moving through different networks would 
1408 
have inhabited ritual and economic worlds governed by mostly unrelated rhythms and 
temporalities as well as distinctive authoritative social actors. 
Just as the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, in contradistinction to its source material, sets out to 
place religious practice within a single shared governing temporality, it also seeks to assign its 
management to a single type of governing authority. Though such an arrangement is nowhere 
in evidence in the source material, and as we shall see, was expressly forbidden by normative 
Dharmaśāstra, Hemādri proposes that the management of these calendrically ordered ritual 
obligations is to be placed in the hands of the Brāhmaṇa Dharmaśāstrin. To us this seems 
unremarkable. It is the “normative” Hindu arrangement that we convey to our students in the 
classroom and that the various political factions on the political subcontinent either celebrate 
as the essence of Bhāratīya culture or declaim as a core component of Brāhmaṇavādin 
oppression. It will thus come as quite a shock to the average reader that, despite its own 
“domesticating tendencies,” the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya, Hemādri’s hundred-year-old 
source material, repeatedly returns to an interconnected series of polemics directed precisely 
at what it sees as the upstart and undesirable office of the Brāhmaṇa as a jack-of-all trades 
overseer of the quotidian religious lives of the general population. Brāhmaṇas, the texts tell us 
again and again, fulfill their own dharma best when they stick to maintaining their agnihotra 
fires instead of dedicating themselves to religious modalities to which their talents are ill suited. 
As learned people, Brāhmaṇas make excellent reciters of kathā and can serve as beneficiaries 
of philanthropy at the end of festivals occasions, but the overall message is that they must 
participate alongside others in religious affairs instead of seeking to dominate them. 
1409 
One place where the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya pointedly communicates this message 
is in the tale of Sāvitrī, which at three hundred and nine verses is one of its longest chapters.1265 
The kathā runs as follows. In the absence of his first wife, Sāvitrī, who was away performing 
penance, Brahmā decided he was going to perform an elaborate Vedic ritual. Since a yajamāna 
must always act in concert with his wife, Brahmā married again, this time to Gāyatrī. By 
overburdening each verse with terms of art from Vaidika ritual and ācāra, the text polemically 
and at some length deliberately communicates the “hyper Brāhmaṇical” nature of this whole 
affair. When Sāvitrī hears that this new upstart has taken her place at Brahmā’s side, she 
became furious. Arriving at the sacrifice as it commences, the irate goddess curses everyone 
in attendance. For the most part, these are the usual curses we find again and again in Purāṇas. 
Brahmā will have no temples. Śiva’s penis will fall off. Viṣṇu will have to be reborn in human 
and animal form repeatedly to atone for his sins. Lakṣmī, we are told, will become fickle as 
fortune never staying in one place, a typical trope, except that here the text inserts the 
extraordinary caveat that her true home will be among the Mlecchas and tribal folk. In any 
case, having dispensed with the gods, Sāvitrī now turns to the Brāhmaṇas: 
Then Sāvitrī cursed all the Brāhmaṇas and the ṛtvijs: “You will always be going to holy spots and tīrthas out of greed, taking monetary gifts for your agnihotra sacrifices. [As a result, for you] the office of householdership and married life will bear no fruit. You will always be gratified only by the food that is offered by others. . . . You will perform rituals on behalf of those who are not eligible and deserving. . . . You will accept alms from despicable people. At death, you will become pretas.1266 
Sāvitrī’s curse is somewhat tempered by the intervention of Gāyātri. She promises that 
Brāhmaṇas who persist in their agnihotra while keeping her name and form on their lips will 
1265The narrative occupies pages 70–74 in the vulgate Skanda Purāṇa. 1266Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya: brāhmaṇān ṛtvijaḥ sarvān sāvitrī hy aśapat tadā / pratigrahāgnihotrāś ca vṛthā dārā vṛthāśramāḥ // sadā kṣetrāṇi tīrthāni lobhād eva gamiṣyatha / apareṣu [var. purāneṣu?] sadā tṛptā ataptāḥ svagṛheṣu ca // ayājyayājanaṃ kṛtvā kutsitasya pratigraham / vṛthā dhanārjanaṃ kṛtvā vyayaś caiva tathā vṛthā // mṛtānāṃ tena pretatvaṃ bhaviṣyati na saṃśayaḥ / 
1410 
attain a good reward after death and that in this world, they will be the recipients of food and 
philanthropy and will flourish in the sabhās of great rulers. In other words, the text juxtaposes 
two paradigms for “being Brāhmaṇa”: being a Vaidika ritualist with an esteemed position in 
the transactional world, and being a Brāhmaṇa who performs other sorts of rituals and engages 
with the culture of the sacred fields, exalting the first and denigrating the second. The 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi becomes the primary vehicle for the widespread dissemination of this 
once very popular vow, which, like everything else from the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya, until 
this point in history had yet to have surface in any work on ritual or dharmanibandha. As you 
might by now expect, however, despite the fact that the majority of the kathā is faithfully 
transposed, none of these materials defaming Brāhmaṇas—indeed defaming precisely the type 
of Brāhmaṇas who would make use of a dharmanibandha in observing their livelihood—make 
their way into the Caturvargacintāmaṇi. 
The dynamic tension that is often in evidence between the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s 
commitment to comprehensiveness and its efforts at curating the knowledge it seeks to convey 
to bring its contents into alignment with the ideological vision propounded throughout the 
nibandha is even more strongly in evidence when it comes to the way the work handles the 
worship of Bhūtamātā and her annual celebration. This is far and away the most spectacular 
example of Hemādri’s efforts in what is effectively the redaction and sublimation not just of 
particular texts but of lived traditions.1267 In the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, the worship of this 
goddess, whom the māhātmya’s kathā associates quite explicitly with one particular place near 
Somanātha, is extracted out from where it would appear within the itinerary of a pilgrim at 
1267The observant reader may have noticed that “Bhūtamātā” is also the generic name assigned to the goddess Kālī as she appears at Lakṣmī Dŏḍḍagaddavaḷḷi and that the Bhūtamātā festival is where Someśvara III first encountered the tradition of the gondhal. See chapter 7. 
1411 
Prabhāsakṣetra who was following the Tīrthakhaṇḍa. Instead, the text is transposed into the 
later divisions of the CVC’s Vratakhaṇḍa and the procedures are denuded of any specific 
affiliation with place. Such repurposing in and of itself is enough to fundamentally change the 
meaning of the practice—it is now seasonal, part and parcel of an emergent program of a 
unified “Brāhmaṇical calendar” as opposed to a localized matter of deśācāra, the management 
of which is the responsibility of localized, potentially non-Brāhmaṇa authorities. In fact, 
however, Hemādri also chooses to alter the date of the observance, shifting the festival from 
its original celebration on the first through fifteenth days of lunar fortnight in the month of 
Vaiśakha (roughly April/May) to the corresponding dates in Jyeṣṭha (May/June). Apart from 
the festivities now occurring at the very worst part of the summer months, this shift also 
decouples the Bhūtamātā celebrations as it is to be observed by “Brāhmaṇical society” from 
the apparently more archaic high Śākta reveries onto which the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya had 
attempted to symbiotically attach itself. As we will soon see, the māhātmya, at least in part, is 
composed in the service of coopting these festivals. 
Through incorporating the Bhūtamātā utsava, the Purāṇa seeks to insert itself into what 
were apparently already ongoing performances, conducted by worshippers who have dedicated 
themselves to Bhairava and the goddess. In doing so, the intent is to interpolate into the wider 
discourse a competing system of semiotics that inscribes a different meaning onto 
Bhairavāgama-inspired public rites that, as we shall see, involved dressing up as ferocious 
Śākta deities. Hemādri, in contrast, sets out not only to manage meaning by shaping the 
publics’ reception of an unruly festival, but through rendering the original festival an “orphan” 
observance, out of step with shared social norms, to deinstitutionalize and delegitimize the old 
ways along with those who conducted themselves according to those values. To make sense of 
1412 
our author’s exercise in the reinvention of tradition, we need to attend in some detail to the 
rites for Bhūtamātā. 
In its usual fashion, the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya introduces this festival in the context 
of a conversation conducted between Īśvara and the goddess. Bhūtamātā, we are told, lives a 
hundred bow lengths to the west of the ritual center dedicated to Sāvitrī. There, she is 
constantly surrounded by ninety million gaṇas, pretas, and bhūtas. The goddess, we learn, is 
perplexed—not as one might imagine by the logistics entailed in the care and feeding of so 
many creepy creatures, nor regarding the geometrical conundrum of how one fit them all on a 
relatively small plot of land—but rather by the peculiar behavior of human beings. 
In the name of Bhūtamātā, in every village and town, people run about singing, dancing, and laughing rapturously. As if they are insane, they prattle and babble. As if in a drunken stupor, they fall on the ground. As if enraged, they run about and drag others around as if they were corpses. People fracture happiness as if seized by the wind. Like ghouls, they wade through the muck—urine, water, and ash. Is this path (mārga) indicated by scripture? Or is it merely a worldly practice? O Lord, my mind is confused by this. Are you are able to explain? How is Bhūtamātā worshipped by people residing at Prabhāsakṣetra? Why did the goddess go there? When did she arrive? On which day and in which month is her great festival (mahotsava) to be celebrated?1268 
Īśvara responds by reminding the goddess that long ago, in the dvāpara yuga, shortly 
after their marriage, he had been overcome by the sight of her body— her beautiful buttocks 
and lofty and firm and perky breasts. Consumed by desire, upon the peak of Mount Mandara, 
he engaged in divine play (divyakrīḍana) and made love to her without ceasing for a thousand 
years in the reckoning of the gods (surate divyaṃ varṣaśatam). In retrospective, one might 
well have preferred that the couple had used protection, for when they untangle their long-

intertwined bodies, sexual discharge spills out on the ground and spawns some rather 
undesirable entities. From the female substance, there arises a dark-skinned potbellied being 
called Śivā whose accoutrements of a necklace of skulls, a crown of skulls, a khaṭvāṅga and 
ḍamaru recalls the Kāpālikas. Śivā, we learn, is the source of all the Brāhmaṇarākṣasīs in the 
world. While found all over our reality, including soaring through the sky making pheṭ sounds, 
the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya informs us that their preferred habitat is in the boughs of the 
śleṣmātaka tree. In much the same way, Śiva’s spent seed inadvertently sired a male 
counterpart to Śivā, a being who resembled Bhairava in his form of Gajasaṃhāra, whose 
retinue includes male monsters with the faces of lions and tigers. 
The divine parents tell their offspring that their will power will reach its apex in the 
night and that the domain that is reserved especially for them is the supreme place at 
Prabhāsakṣetra where Bhūtamātā is venerated. Switching registers, very much in the manner 
of the sort of demonological treatises from which these materials were likely adapted, the text 
next offers us a detailed account of the types of places and conditions that favor these creatures. 
As in the older Bhūta Tantras, such as the Kriyākālaguṇottara and the traces of a Kumāra 
tradition redacted into the Netra Tantra, predatory entities are seen as taking residence in 
spaces where there is a disjuncture or imbalance.1269 Such breaks in normativity can be caused 
by sexual impropriety, by disabled people continuing to practice fire rites, by keeping on hand 
in the house human bones, by speaking harsh words and having conflict in the family, by 
haphazardly scattering about your possessions, by not bathing, by not honoring guests and 
feeding children—even—horror of horrors, by women who choose to pound their mortar and 
pestle while sitting on the lower part of the threshold of a door. These faux pas of course are

1414 
all extrapolations from an older logic surrounding the chāyāchidrā—the gap that creates a 
shadow or is itself a shadow—where ruptures in human normativity make it possible for 
supernatural creatures compelled by a terrible hunger to infiltrate their way into human lives 
and feed off the household. 
What is new to our māhātmya is the introduction of another register of violation 
grounded in doctrinal claims as well as the extolling of devotional commitments as 
apotropaically efficacious. Demons are invited to take residence in places where Śiva is treated 
as an ordinary being or is not recognized as superior to all other entities, where the liṅga is not 
worshipped, where mantras are not repeated, and where the people do not display devotional 
affect. That this is not simply an expression of Śaiva chauvinism is made clear by the analogous 
designation of homes where Vāsudeva is worshipped with bhakti as equally off limits. This 
collection of nearly forty verses ends with a clear designation of the time when the festival is 
to be celebrated, its immediate benefit—it ensures creepy creatures do not reside in your 
home— as well as with a reiteration that those who chant the names of Viṣṇu or repeat “oṃ 
namaḥ śivāya” with devotional affect (bhaktibhāva) fall outside the jurisdiction of the mothers 
and the ghouls. 
Most of the roughly fifty verses that make up the remainder of the text delineate in 
sequence the different activities that occur during the festival of Bhūtamātā. The rituals begin 
with the devotees watering the trees where these creatures like to reside, making offering of 
sacred threads, sindura, flower and incense, and then of grains and puddings. This is then 
followed by the performance of a series of morality plays called preraṇīyakas during the day 
and observance of the vigil (jāgran) of the goddess in the night, accompanied by loud 
1415 
tumultuous celebratory sounds. This ritual in particular, which we will attend to shortly, our 
text discusses at great length. 
Then, on the ninth or eleventh lunar day, within small pits, lamps are kindled. In that 
place, masks (mukhabiṃba) are made, either out of wood and plaster (lepa-dāru) or painted 
wood, depending on how one construes the compound. These artifacts are crafted so as to 
convey both ferocious and pacifying modes. They should depict the mothers, Caṇḍikā, 
rākṣasas, bhūtas, pretas, piśācas and śākiṇī, all of whose actions and gestures convey a range 
of affects (hāvabhāvakṛtāni, a Marathi-ism). On the inauspicious new moon, in a secret field 
(guptaṃ tīrthaṃ), hidden by many protections (rakṣibhir bahubhiḥ), during the daytime, those 
celebrating the rites gather and perform their rituals, filling the domain with the appropriate 
sounds. In a call back to the ancient idiom of the Atimārga, this coming together of bhaktas in 
the guise of the goddess and her retinue is called the diṇḍīmaṇḍalī. Then, at twilight, while 
wearing their masks and making the kīrtana of the kula and the great sounds of the pheṭkāra, 
the adepts should go to the place where people have encircled the goddess and are worshipping 
her. In accordance with the procedure called the conduct of the vīra (vīracaryāvidhāna), the 
lamp that accomplishes everything, they should then wander about the city at night. This 
procession of the lamps—the text is maddeningly unclear whether we are talking actual torches 
or whether the lamps in question are the costumed affect of the adepts—is to take place 
habitually up through the fifteenth tithi. So long as this happens, obstacles do not make their 
way into people’s homes and lives. After indulging in a bit more cryptozoology that provides 
further speciation of subtypes of piśācas and their preferred habitats, as well as a quite pointed 
polemic against those folks—including artisans—who worship piśācas as their chief deities, 
the text concludes by reaffirming that Bhūtamātā lives by the edge of the sea at Prabhāsakṣetra 
1416 
and that those who worship her will have a special way with women, sire no ungrateful 
children, and live a life free from assault by supernatural entities. 
Through institutionalizing the Bhūtamātā festival concurrently with the summer new 
moon, which is associated with the most transgressive Kaula observances, the 
Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya itself sets out to socialize and normalize the yearly activities of 
Kaulācāryas and their communities, including the sort of mimetic observances of mudrās we 
find in the Jayadrathayāmala where adepts dress themselves up as Bhairava and the goddess. 
Indeed, the strategies it employs are eerily in line with still living traditions observed in the 
Kathmandu Valley where, for example, until recently, performance traditions aligned with 
Navarātra dancers were at once public affairs sanctioned by the state with didactic dimensions 
affirming the social order and yet still harbored a darker subtext where the dancers’ mimetic 
activities of embodying the dark were seen as extending to the clandestine abduction and 
sacrificing of children. The negotiations of different value systems our text conducts are hardly 
that dimorphic, but nevertheless, what is at work is an overcoding of a “conventional 
varṇāśramadharma morality” on top of a system of praxis that very clearly eschewed or at 
best barely tolerated such values. 
In the Vratakhaṇḍa of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Hemādri offers a rather radical 
redaction of this archive. We have already seen that by simply changing the date of the 
Bhūtamātā utsava so it no longer coincides with the older observances of the Śāktas, Hemādri 
fundamentally changes the social function of the festival. Succinctly, the older observances of 
the kula rites and the diṇḍimaṇḍalī, motivated by commitments whose origins lie outside of 
the world of Dharmaśāstra, are effectively out of step with the new universal calendar. 
Unsurprisingly, this sort of retrofitting is even more prominent when it comes to the actual 
1417observances constitutive of the festival and the divergences from the source materials are even 
more drastic. In fact, Hemādri’s editorial sleight of hand somewhat sloppily even seeks to elide 
the textual point of origins of the Bhūtamātotsava. Our Vratakhaṇḍa does not even ascribe this 
selection to the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya. Instead, without specifying a textual source, the 
Bhūtamātā festival is introduced not as part of the interchanges between the goddess and god, 
but ostensibly as a component of conversation in which Yuddhiṣṭhira plays the role of inquirer 
and Vāsudeva Kṛṣṇa provides the answers.1270 It is almost certain that this repackaging is itself 
a matter of editorial subterfuge and not an indication that Hemādri was drawing upon parallel 
source materials preserved in another Purāṇa. Not only are large portions of the two texts 
verbatim identical, but in several places in the CVC’s version, Kṛṣṇa addresses the Pāṇḍava 
king with obviously inappropriate feminine vocatives invoking various names of the 
goddess.1271 Precisely these same vocatives are found in the corresponding verses of the 
Skanda Purāṇa. There is no ambiguity between the direction of these textual borrowings, for 
as we have seen throughout his work, Hemādri cites copiously and, barring deliberate editorial 
decisions, directly from a Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya virtually identical to the printed work. 
This source material is not only at least a century older than this nibandha, but in situ the 
discourse it presents is frequently coherent without reference to metatextual frameworks in a 
way that the CVC’s repurposing of it is not. 
1270The Bhūtamātotsavavidhāna occupies pg. 365–370 of the Vrata Khaṇḍa, vol. 2, part 2, in the Bharatacandra Siromani edition of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi. It begins as follows: yuddhiṣṭhira uvāca / bhūtamāteti saṃhṛṣṭo grāme grāme pure pure / gāyan nṛtyan hasan lokaḥ sarvataḥ paridhāvati // unmattavat pralapati kṣitau patati mattavat / kruddhavad dhāvati tarāṃ mṛtatvat krandate bahiḥ // mukhāṅgabhaṅgaṃ kurute loko vāyugṛhītavat / bhūtavad bhasmamūtraṃ tu kardamān avagāhate // kim eṣa śāstranirdiṣṭo mārgaḥ kim uta laukikaḥ / muhyate te manah kṛṣṇa tvam eva vaktum arhasi // While offering select variant readings, some of which are merely the product of corruptions, Hemādri has altered the syntax, changed some gender agreements, and inserted a vocative invocation of Kṛṣṇa with the aim of eliding the text’s point of origin. 1271Perhaps the most egregious example is the following passage, in verse 18 of the Vrata Khaṇḍa’s rendition, where Kṛṣṇa addresses Arjuna out of the blue as “devi,” following the original: bhrātṛbhāṇḍau yathā devi tadvad etau matau mama. Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Vratakhaṇḍa, vol. 2 part 2, pg. 367. 
1418 
Though he erases all specific references to Prabhāsakṣetra, Hemādri retains a slightly 
trimmed version of the narrative of the origin of Bhūtamātā and her retinue, right up through 
the moment in the text where the male and female entities emerge from the spilled sexual 
fluids. Then the texts diverge, for while in both sources Hara offers these new creatures a boon, 
in Hemādri’s text there is no indication that these creatures and their followers are given 
dominion over the night. In place of the original’s extended crypto-zoological exercises in 
demonology outlining the habits of various types of entities as well the circumstances under 
which they can assail humans, all of which find no mention in the CVC, Hemādri interpolates 
a banal set of verses that prescribe a standardized mode of worship. “O goddess [sic],” we are 
told “a man who worships with candana, with dhūpa, and flowers with devotion,” and who 
also “feeds Brāhmaṇas with payasa, soup, barley and wheat cakes, will sire many sons, raise 
herds of domestic animals, and have good health all his days.”1272 Most importantly, and here 
our author resumes citing from the source text, “in his house, there should be no śākinīs, no 
piśācas, and rākṣasas, and his babies play and they become big without becoming ill.” Rather 
curiously, given how central such concerns are to his overall interpretive project, apart from a 
stray mention that this new program of worship is to be done “out of bhakti,” Hemādri’s 
selection of material expunges the ecumenical devotional theology of the original where 
fervent and embodied displays of either Śaiva or Vaiṣṇava religiosity were extolled as 
protecting one from the forces of the night. Such elisions, whose content on the surface would 
seem to be a perfect fit with Hemādri’s own commitments as a devotee of Harihara, make 
sense only once we see them as part of a larger project of demoting the goddess Bhūtamātā 
1272Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Vratakhaṇḍa, vol. 2 part 2, pg. 367: candanena samālabhya puṣpadhūpair athārcayet / bhojayet kṣipraṃ saṃyāva[kṛṣarā]pūpapāyasaiḥ // ya evaṃ kurute devi puruṣo bhaktibhāvitaḥ / sa putrapaśuvṛddhiṃ ca śarīrārogyam āpnuyāt //

from a deity whose worship is aligned with and sanctioned by the great gods of what will 
become Hinduism into a nuisance whose festival is valuable only in as much as it serves as 
staging ground for presenting didactic cautionary tales to the public. 
As we have seen, in the original source material, the Bhūtamātotsava was comprised 
of an initial series of rites where, through stringing up threads and offering pāyasa and other 
puddings, trees are venerated for their role in housing predatorial entities. After the trees are 
worshipped, for several days, morality dramas called compellers (preraṇīyakas) were to be 
performed during the day while jāgrans honoring the goddess, complete with raucous 
celebrations and loud music were observed at night. As the festival draws to a close—the 
dramas cease and the celebrants don masks and dress up as the gods. During the day, in a secret 
place they perform their worship, and then at night in costume and in character, they wander 
through the streets of the city, bearing either literal or metaphorical torches. Of these varied 
dimensions of the festival, Hemādri’s rendition retains only two elements intact: the staging of 
the didactic dramas and the procession with torches. As we shall see, instead of distinguishing 
between a separate stage of respected mimetic worship that follows the dumb show, Hemādri 
redacts the text so that the two activities are conflated. In this way, instructions in general 
morality occurring in tandem with observations from the high Śākta Tantras are transmuted 
into a sustained polemic enacted in public against the Śākta Tantras themselves. The opening 
of this section, which incorporates a line of commentary by Hemādri, is worth quoting at some 
length: 
The goddess who has all faults (sarvadoṣā bhagavatī) ensures the welfare of the children. She is worshipped with different names, [at] different times, with different rituals. In the Jyeṣṭha month, beginning with the pratipat day, up until the fifteenth date. . . . 
1420 
Hemādri: It is said to be [observed in] Jyeṣṭha with the intention of it being [observed] during [the period in the month] that culminates at the full moon. . . . 
Up through that time period, pūjā is to be done by the Preraṇī performers in the must- see dramas (preraṇīprekṣaṇīyakaiḥ). [Then] there will be shown the instruction concerning the results of bad actions, which is for the derision of the heretics. [It is performed] by men who, intent on being ridiculed, engage in “wonderous” activity. 1273 
In much the same way that Hemādri rebrands the ritual focus of the festival by recasting 
what was previously a revered but dangerous esoteric goddess as “the one who has all faults,” 
he reimagines the performative focus of the festival into a pointed exercise in ideological 
criticism. In the previous chapter, we have already encountered the preraṇīpaddhati in the 
context of our study of Hemādri’s immediate predecessor Śārṅgadeva, who in his 
Saṅgītaratnākara has made it quite evident that in early medieval Maharashtra a mere 
generation before our author, this was a widely accepted multifaceted Śaiva performance 
tradition. As Mandakranta Bose has discussed at some length in her unpublished thesis (parts 
of which appear verbatim in her monograph Movement and Mimesis), prior to the fourteenth 
century, the dramaturgical and strictly musicological traditions seemed to have harbored 
substantively divergent understandings of what this artform entailed, for while “in sangita 
literature prerana (or its variants, perana or perani) appears in almost every work as a form [of 
sic] dancing.”1274 In the Abhinavabhāratī, Abhinavagupta quotes from a lost work by some 
1273Here the vulgate Skanda Purāṇa reads: sarvatrair pāḥ bhagavatī bālānāṃ hitakāriṇī / Hemādri transmutes this to the very different (Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Vratakhaṇḍa, vol. 2 part 2, pg. 368): sarvadoṣā bhagavatī bālānāṃ hitakāraṇī / nāmabhedaiḥ kriyābhedaiś kālabhedaiḥ ca pūjyate // The vulgate then gives the specification: pratipatprabhṛti vaiśākhe yāvac caturdaśītithiḥ / Hemādri, in contrast reconstrues the date and then adds his own commentary: pratipatprabhṛti jyeṣṭhe yāvat pañcadaśī tithiḥ / Hemādri: paurṇāmāsyāntamāsābhiprāyeṇa jyeṣṭha ityuktiḥ / tāvat pūjā prakartavyā preraṇaiḥ prekṣaṇīyakaiḥ // vikarmaphalanirdeśaḥ pāṣaṇḍānāṃ viḍam[b]anaṃ / pradarśyate hāsyaparair naraiḥ adbhutaceṣṭitaiḥ // The vulgate then continues to discuss a series of rituals, all elided in the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, before going on to introduce another subject. Hemādri, in contrast, reorganizes the verses so that the plays are to be seen as providing instruction (nirdeśa) in the bad conduct of heretics, activities that will then be conflated with vīracaryā. 1274Mandakranta Bose, Movement and Mimesis: The Idea of Dance in the Sanskritic Tradition [Dordrecht: Springer, 1991), 185. 
1421 
under-specified “ancient authorities (cirantana) in which the preraṇa is characterized as 
having humor as the dominant element (hāsyaprāya). It is thus the dramaturgical 
understanding that seemingly much more closely aligned with the practice as evident in the 
Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya. In the Abhinavabhāratī, Abhinavagupta’s theory of how humor 
operates assigns a rather substantial place to incongruity (anaucitya) as catalyzing laughter in 
an audience. What comic theatre does, he tell us, is it brings into our awareness the gap between 
the expectations we have derived from the social conventions we have inherited and what is 
actually happening on the stage, creating an experience that at once affirms and questions such 
norms. As we shall soon see, humor in the didactic “must-see plays” (prekṣaṇīya) enjoined by 
the Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya and embraced by Hemādri seemingly serves a rather different 
function. Rather than staging scenes that derive their emotional power from violating our 
expectations, this kind of humor thrives on confirming our shared cultural biases, enjoining 
the audience to join in on the act of ridiculing not only the performance but the performers. 
Out of greed for [the things of] this world, one who recites the sacred texts has been restrained upon the path. Behold! He is being “superimposed” (i.e., impaled) on the tip of the trident. 
You all have seen that he has delighted in touching the wives of other men. Having severed his two hands, he is tossed by the Lord into the lotus pond. . . . The one who was delighted by coconut and palm [liquor] is cut with an umbrella. The one who does good deeds ascends to a white lion throne and reaches happiness. 
Hey, people—do you not see? Another person, who reviles his lord (svamīdrohaka) is being rent by a handsaw. His insides burst forth and blood [wells up] from within. A thief, who causes everyone anxiety, has been caught and is being struck by blows from a staff by corporal punishment officers. Having been restrained, he is led away to be killed, his face hangs down in shame.1275

Granted, humor is often extremely culturally specific, and to be charitable one could 
well imagine that gifted physical comedians miming some of these activities might effect a 
certain charm. Still, Sanskrit kāvyas and especially dramatic farces are frequently still 
extremely funny for modern audiences, while this sort of thing, at least to the modern reader, 
simply resembles socially coercive gratuitous displays of violence designed to hammer home 
a message to the assembled audience about the terrible consequences inherent in all forms of 
moral impropriety. Most pertinently, for our purposes, the majority of the suggested episodes 
are particularly heavy with references to a Śākta imaginary, and the intention seems not merely 
to mock some bad apples out of the bunch, but to condemn these systems of value in toto as 
the poisoned fruit produced by the goddess who harbors all faults. 
How Hemādri manages this, you may have guessed, is largely a matter of selective 
editing of his sources. The last figure to be mocked in his source material is a white haired old 
Brāhmaṇa man who has gone chasing after an elderly prostitute, a typical figure for Sanskrit 
parody.1276 In his dotage, this lecherous and greedy man, like a child, has taken on the great 
vow (mahāvrata) and now dresses as Bhairava (bhairavābharaṇa) his eyes lolling about 
(ghūrṇitalocanaḥ). In a similar manner, the woman he chases after is compared with a yoginī 
who goes about wearing a black blanket (possibly an allusion to the infamous nīlāmbara sect). 
Surrounded by children, she goes about dancing. In the root text, where the doctrine itself is

1423 
not the direct point of the critique, we encounter this amusing bickering couple and then the 
division of must-see theatre comes to a close, at which point the text introduces the entirely 
discrete topic of the procession of the vīras. In the root text, not only is this practice not a 
subject for critique, but it is actually taking place on entirely different days of the festival than 
the must-see parodies. 
What Hemādri’s text does, through rewriting and reediting his source, is to dissolve 
these boundaries so that the vīra procession is now led by the actor who is dressed as a sad 
excuse for a Bhairava with the diṇḍīmaṇḍalī being led by the pathetic and crazy old crone (she 
has the garb of the insane, she who participates in the maṇḍali of the diṇḍis). With separate 
gatherings of Śākta practitioners now elided, it is now these actors who go on procession 
through the streets each and every day, up through the final day of the rite. In this instantiation 
of the tradition, the practice no longer culminates in Kaula-tinged celebrations conducted in 
the dead of night where devotees celebrate the goddess by dancing, singing, and making 
pheṭkāra cries. Nor on the last day are the piśācas and other such entities formally honored. 
Instead, Hemādri replaces this old practice with a new and rather banal form of celebration in 
the service of much more quotidian ends. 
Thus, you should send the lamps on procession, up through the fifteenth day. On the fifteenth day one should do the great festival of the Bhūtamātā. One should bathe, and one should worship, and one should give fruit and sweets. Having bowed, being together with one’s own people, having caused to be forgiven, one should go to the house. For the one who does this festival, O Pārtha, year by year, an obstacle does not arise in the house for that entire year.1277 
1277Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Vratakhaṇḍa, vol. 2 part 2, pg. 369–70: nayet pradoṣa[emd. pradīpa]samaye yatra devī janair vṛtā / vīracaryyāsu kathit[o] dīpaḥ sarvārthasādhakaḥ //. . . . evaṃ niṣkrāmayed dīpaṃ yāvat pañcadaśī tithiḥ / pañcadaśyāṃ prakurvīta bhūtamātur mahotsavam // snāpayet pūjayed dadyān naivedyaṃ phalalodanaṃ[emd. modakam] / praṇamya svajanaiḥ sārddhaṃ kṣamayitvā gṛhaṃ vrajet // ya evaṃ kurute pārtha varṣe varṣe mahotsavam / tasya saṃvatsaraṃ yāvat gṛhe vighnaṃ na jāyate / 
1424 
Perhaps nowhere is the distinction between the worldviews animating these two 
distinctive takes on what is ostensibly the same festival rendered more clearly than in their 
representations of the phalaśruti for the festival. Here is the vulgate: 
This goddess was established in Prabhāsa to the north of the sea. He who understands the origin of the goddess that is destructive of sins shall never beget a despicable child. He is never assailed by the defects of the bhūtas, pretas, and piśācas. He shall be rid of all sins. He shall be endowed with faithfulness in marriage. He will obtain all his desires. He will delight the hearts of women. The devotees should accept and believe in the Bhavabhūtamātṛ, the bestower of freedom from fear through her laughs, graces, and services. Those devotees become happy in the company of their brothers, servants, sons, and kinsmen. They will be free of all kinds of disasters.1278 
And here, at Hemādri’s hands, is how this passage is rewritten: 
Those ones who honor, with the sports that make people laugh, the creator of the bhūtas on the earth who bestows fearlessness, become happy and are devoid of all misfortune, along with their brothers, dependents, sons, and relative folks, for a year.1279 
For all the technicalities that underwrite the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s transmutation of 
its sources, the message it seeks to convey is simple and clear. From henceforth, Tantra as a 
knowledge system will be assigned a marginal and subordinate place in discourse and will 
occupy no special domain within our world. 
A Religion for Bureaucrats: Reinventing a Purely Brāhmaṇical Philanthropy 
In his introduction to the compilation of the great Ludo Rocher’s collected essays, reflecting 
upon his mentor’s representation of Hindu law as above all else a scholastic enterprise whose 
relation to what we call positive law—and with it concrete social practice—was hardly 
transparent, Donald Davis makes a rather telling observation that offers fitting prelude to our 
1278 Prabhāsakṣetramāhātmya: prabhāse saṃsthitā devī samudrād uttareṇa tu / ya etāṃ veda vai devyā utpattiṃ pāpanaśinīm // kutsitā santatis tasya na bhavec ca kadācana / bhūtapretapiśācānām na doṣaiḥ paribhūyate // sarvapāpavinirmuktaḥ sarvasaubhāgyasaṃyutaḥ / sarvān kāmān avāpnoti nārīhṛdayanandaḥ // ye mānayanti nijahāsakalair vilāsaiḥ / saṃsevayā abhayadāṃ bhavabhūtamātām / te bhātṛbhṛtyasutabandhujanair yutāś ca / sarvopasargarahitāḥ sukhino bhavanti / 1279Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Vratakhaṇḍa, vol. 2 part 2, pg. 370: ye mānayanti janahāsaka[r]air vilāsai rāmecayed abhayadāṃ bhūvi bhūtadhātrīm / te bhrātṛbhṛtyasutabandhujanair sahābdaṃ sarvopasargarahitāḥ sukhino bhavanti //

own investigation.1280 Rocher had dedicated a lifetime to learning how to reason inside the 
conceptual framework of Hindu Dharmaśāstra with a meticulouslessness and precision 
unmatched by any other Western scholar. As the anthology Davis complied makes evident, the 
result was that when Rocher came upon an incongruity or point of disputation within the 
dharma literature, he was able to look at the problem and address it as if he himself were a 
dharmādhikarin relying on an implicit mastery of the intertextual resources constitutive of the 
discourse while deploying traditional modes of reasoning derived from the disciplines of 
grammar and Mīmāṃsā exegesis. Dharmaśāstra, in this representation, is thus less contingent 
on the study of any particular text than it entails an internalization of modes of exegetical 
reasoning that came into play wherever and whenever one set out to study and translate a 
specific passage found anywhere in this śāstra. 
Like many of his pre-colonial predecessors, however, Rocher’s scholarship was 
primarily concerned with marshaling enormous erudition in the service of precisely 
determining the meaning of particular words or phrases so that one could make sense of their 
application in hyper-specific contexts. In short, its orientation is hermeneutical as opposed to 
conceptual. For all its many other strengths, his method and intellectual style was much less 
predisposed to thinking about individual texts—let alone textual corpuses— as conceptual 
wholes working within particularized social and historical moments to effect specific quotidian 
ends. On those occasions where he was asked to think in more general terms about the nature 
of Dharmaśāstra as Hindu law and to reflect on its social application, eschewing the 
prescriptive texts, Rocher would almost inevitably turn to invoking what were essentially 
1280Ludo Rocher, Studies in Hindu Law and Dharmaśāstra, ed. Donald Davis (New York: Anthem Press, 2012). 
1426 
anthropological observations by non-Indian outsiders concerning the “actual” method 
animating Hindu legal proceedings. As Davis observes: 
If Dharmaśāstra is a scholarly discipline in the first place (and not a set of practical laws) and if dharma is a unified, but complex subject (that does not become more law- oriented over time), then what does Rocher think is the connection between Dharmaśāstra, dharma, and law, if anything? Here Rocher takes his cue from an early Western observer of India, Father Bouchet, a French Jesuit from Pondicherry. Boucher, like Megasthenes 2000 years earlier, notes that the administration of law in his long acquaintance with India never occurred with reference to law books or written laws of any kind (Rocher 1984: 18). According to Rocher, ‘The main conclusion to be drawn from Bouchet’s letter is that. . . law was administered on the basis of unwritten maxims, which were transmitted from generation to generation in the local vernaculars, some of them applicable to the population of the area generally, others to specific groups such as the members of a particular caste only’. . . . Indeed, Rocher refers at several places in his writings to the importance of maxims. . . in the practical law of India. He connects the importance of legal maxims several times with larger questions about orality in India and the unlikelihood of written laws having much impact in such a committedly oral environment.1281 
Reflecting respectfully but not uncritically on his mentor’s legacy, while 
acknowledging that Rocher’s core insight of the centrality of oral dimensions of Indian legal 
discourse as it is enacted on the ground has much to recommend itself, Davis candidly tells his 
reader that he has “long been frustrated by the maddening vagueness of phrases such as 
‘floating maxims’ and ‘traditional customs.’”1282 When, in reconstructing Rocher’s position as 
it lies latent throughout his oeuvre, from the perspective of a hermeneutics of charity, Davis 
observes in passing that “Rocher does not make any connection between vernacular and 
Sanskrit maxims, nor does he explore the legal usage of either sort of maxim in any detail,”1283 
it seems as though Davis is on the cusp of making explicit a very important connection, namely, 
that much of the later dharma literature itself can be more readily characterized as “collections 
1281Donald Davis, “Introduction,” in Studies in Hindu Law and Dharmaśāstra, ed. Donald Davis (New York: Anthem Press, 2012), 24. 1282Donald Davis, “Introduction,” 24. 1283Donald Davis, “Introduction,” 25. 
1427of maxims” (albeit in Sanskrit rather than the vernacular) than it can be seen as a purely 
intellectual exercises in textual exegesis aimed at attaining internal hermeneutic coherency. 
Indeed, already by the eleventh century, starting it seems in and around southern 
Bengal, the dharma discourse has begun to move away from an exclusive privileging of modes 
of textual production that take the form of systematic readings of text—aimed at producing 
wide ranging commentaries and subcommentaries covering multiple domains—in favor of 
topic specific treatises on the one hand and vast compilations of dharmanibandha on the other. 
The chief virtue of these new prakaraṇa texts—addressing for example ritual impurity or rites 
of expiation—is that their topical organization made them ideal reference guides. The earlier 
state of the field was such that recovering what the traditional authorities had to say about, for 
example, the different types of ritual impurity virtually required a competent jurist to have an 
encyclopedic command of whole commentaries. This was the case because an author such as 
Vijñāneśvara, whose own text was organized in terms of an exegetical project of making sense 
of a root text, was highly unlikely to have presented the entirety of his own views on a given 
topic in a single, easily identifiable, and readily accessible portion of his treatise. Instead, it 
was likely that his siddhānta would have had to be reconstructed on the basis of locating the 
numerous parenthetical asides and theoretical observations intermittently interwoven 
throughout the whole of his commentary, which each jurist would then have to retrieve and 
synthesize anew. 
With the advent of topic specific prakaraṇa texts, a jurist having to weigh in a 
judgement about some highly specific matter or another could now resort to a single book. It 
would begin by defining the general topic in both practical and logical or philosophical terms 
and then index the rules and conditions specific to the relevant domain so that its intended 
1428 
reader could consult it at their leisure. Each of these specific headings and subsections, much 
like the dharmanibandha works we have been exploring so far, was primarily made up of 
compilations of discrete citations culled from a range of sources, upon which the author then 
offers an occasional comment or gloss. The entire orientation of such works, in other words, 
subordinates an older intellectual project of offering exegesis to the presentation of collections 
of proof texts that derive their relevance in situ from extra-textual—one might even say “real- 
world”—concerns about legal and ritual “best practices.” In this regard, they resemble nothing 
so much as subsections in a larger dharmanibandha work, just as the dharmanibandha genre 
itself reads as an entextualization of long-standing social practices, of the sort we saw briefly 
discussed in the Vikramāṅkābhyudaya, where kings and other authorities empanel a collection 
of dharmādhikarins from a range of traditions and then query their opinions on specific legal 
and ritual matters. In other words what we have been calling “proof texting” and what Rocher 
has been referring to as “maxims” are essentially the same phenomenon unfolding at divergent 
moments in Indian history. And in both cases, what we are actually talking about is not 
reducible to positive law, but amounts to a repertoire of resources that are inoperable and 
effectively meaningless independent from their skillful deployment by the embodied 
subjectivity supplied by individual Dharmaśāstrins. Speaking in general terms, the ultimate 
product of Dharmaśāstra as a discourse was not the production of a legal code of the sort that 
we might associate with Justinian or Aurangzeb. Instead, the discourse aimed to produce a 
particular type of person. In the apt words of Nile Green: 
In practical as well as in conceptual terms, knowledge was located primarily in persons rather than in books. Books were not considered independent sources of knowledge, but were appendages to the personal pedagogical relationships through which knowledge was transferred and within which writing served to provide only one dimension of the knowledge being transferred. . . . Books worked in the service of an anthropocentric model of knowledge, as mnemonic aids and adjuncts to the bodily 
1429 
incorporation of words in the person of the authoritative master and through him to his students. Correspondingly, those in search of knowledge looked for a master rather than a bookshop or a library.1284 
Green, of course, is writing about a distinctive religion—Deccani Islam—at a later 
historical moment—the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries—and moreover, his focus is 
on what can roughly characterized as the esoteric ascesis-oriented as opposed exoteric 
juridically inclined dimensions of the religious culture that he is exploring. Nevertheless, 
Green’s pen portrait of entextualized knowledge as mnemonic aids as well as “appendages” to 
“personal pedagogical relationships” elegantly captures much that is integral more generally 
to the world of South Asian—especially Deccani—approaches to pedagogy and knowledge 
practices. Particularly insightful is Green’s pairing of the mediation of entextualized 
knowledge as always being accessed through the body of a specific teacher with the knowledge 
practice of composing texts that, taken as guides, in and of themselves are quite deliberately 
inadequate to the task of translating written prescriptions into embodied social practices. 
Within the resulting paradigm, books are effectively useless independent of the class of people 
who have spent their lives being fashioned into the right type of vessel for making using of 
their contents. In this regard, the emergence of Dharmaśāstra prakaraṇa works and nibandha 
as a general discipline through presenting more useful cribs that potentially lower the skill level 
necessary for someone to qualify as “the right kind of person” for making the knowledge 
contained in the texts actionable, reads for the most part more as a refining of this framework 
than an actual disruption. 
As you may well be anticipating, it is the Caturvargacintāmaṇi itself that offers the 
first and most substantive challenge to what had been business as usual. While Hemādri’s 
1284Nile Green, “The Uses of Books in a Late Mughal Takiyya: Persianate Knowledge between Person and Paper,” Modern Asian Studies (2010): 243. 
1430 
recasting of the discipline of dharma does retain numerous domains within which the expert 
judgements of the legalist scholar will still prove indispensable, it also reimagines other aspects 
of social practices that fall under the purview of this discipline so as to make them readily 
navigable by less skilled “ordinary” Brāhmaṇas, of no particular erudition, provided they have 
at least a basic knowledge of Sanskrit. What makes such an approach viable is a radical change 
in compositional practice. For the first time, certainly in the history of Dharmaśāstra but quite 
plausibly more generally in Indic ritual, texts are crafted not merely as necessary but not 
sufficient adjuncts to an extratextual embodied form of knowledge. They are envisioned as 
comprehensive and independent step-by-step guides delineating precisely, in order, everything 
that needs to be done to successfully execute a particular ritual activity from beginning to end. 
As we shall soon see, Hemādri’s innovations here draw their inspiration from the institutional 
context in which he has been operating for decades in his office as śrīkaraṇeśvara, namely, 
the transregional world of scribal bureaucracy with its ceaseless production of highly 
conventionalized transactional quotidian paperwork executed in a myriad of languages. 
Just what is new and momentous in Hemādri’s reinvention of the formal dimensions of 
śāstra concerned with the philanthropic process, and the sociological impact of such shifts in 
disciplinarity, becomes readily evident to the reader when we juxtapose the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s discussion of the practice of dāna with a work of the preceding 
century, Ballāla’s Dānasāgara. According to the epigram embedded in the text, the Sena King 
Ballālasena, student of Halāyudha and Aniruddha, the great eastern Dharmaśāstrins of the day, 
and ruler of southern Bengal, finished composing his “Ocean of Philanthropy” in 1168 CE. 
Today, Ballālasena is remembered by Indologists as well as Marxist historians almost solely 
as the reviled restorer of varṇāśramadharma to Bengal as well as the plausible promulgator of 
1431 
the Kulin Brāhmaṇa system.1285 Indeed, such a role is famously hinted at by his ideological 
aside, found towards the beginning of his Dharmaśāstra treatise, rejecting the authority of the 
Devī Purāṇa and with it the wider Śākta ethos stemming from the Brahmayāmala.1286 In the 
realm of Dharmaśāstra, however, by contributing to the new efflorescence of single topic 
prakaraṇa works on discrete subjects of Hindu law, Ballāla needs to be seen as following in 
the footsteps of his mentors. And just like his predecessors, while Ballāla begins by presenting 
a theoretical introduction to the topic at hand organized in terms of the needs of practitioners 
of dāna rites, and not scholastic exegetes, when it comes to the actual presentation of individual 
philanthropic rites, his approach is deeply conventional. Succinctly, he presents us with a series 
of Sanskrit proof texts or floating maxims providing some guidelines for philanthropic 
donations, extracted from a narrative text and presented in meter, which he occasionally 
supplements with prose sentences from his own pen. In Ballāla’s own prose, what we typically 
find is a series of discrete sentences—denoting but not describing a specific part in the ritual 
process—which are daisy chained together through a series of gerunds. This style is very 
typical not only of contemporary non-exegetical works in Dharmaśāstra but more generally of 
paddhatis aligned with any ritual system available from this period. The benefit of such an 
approach is that, much as with our own “to-do lists,” for the ritualist consulting such a passage, 
1285For a glimpse of the depth of the cultural memory concerning Ballālasena as the codifier of Bengali Brāhmaṇa identities even into the colonial period among Bengali Brāhmaṇas, see for example, Y. Sastri, “Origin of the Kap section of the Barendra Class of Brahmans of Bengal,” Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal 72 (1903): 91–96. For the perception of Ballālasena as the codifier of an insidious caste conscious regime in the oral traditions of modern Dalits see: Manoranjan Byapari, Interrogating My Chandal Life: An Autobiography of a Dalit, trans Sipra Mukherjee (New Delhi: SAGE Publications, 2017). On the Sena court in general the reader is directed to Jesse Ross Knutson, Into the Twilight of Sanskrit Court Poetry: The Sena Salon of Bengal and Beyond (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2014). For a summary of Balāllasena’s role as the inventor of the Kulin tradition as it has been received in the wider field of Indian historiography, see Pran Nath Chopra, Religions and Communities of India (Delhi: East-West Publications, 1982). 1286On Ballāla and his sources as well as his practice as Dharmaśāstrin, especially in regard to vidyādāna, Florinda De Simini’s work is indispensable, especially pg. 40–54.

1432 
the precise sequence of ritual acts that makeup the ceremony he is conducting is rendered 
crystal clear at a glance. Due to the paucity of information provided about how exactly one is 
to execute each of the individual sub-acts at any moment in the rite, however, the success or 
failure of the rite is still dependent on the extra-textual inherited and embodied knowledge 
possessed by the individual ritualist. 
Thus, for example, in the section beginning his explanation of the canonical sixteen 
mahādānas,1287 Ballālasena starts us off by citing the proof text from the Matsya Purāṇa that 
outlines the hierarchy of philanthropic rites and extolling their practice. 1288 Ballālasena then 
offers us his own “contextualization” of the main aspects of the preliminary activities that 
preface the rite up through the formulation of the ritual intention (saṅkalpa).1289 In this way, 
using his own prose, our author provides us a concrete delineation of the relevant procedures, 
virtually all of which are not evident in the proof text he invokes. Ballāla’s analysis runs as 
follows: by the ritualist, first, there needs to be warding off of obstacles (nirvighnaṃ). Then 
for the sake of the accomplishing of the main part of the sacrifice, having taken the authority 
(anujñāṃ gṛhītvā), having enacted the pūjā of Vināyaka, Śiva, and Kṛṣṇa, and performed 
veneration, using cloth and so forth, to the Brāhmaṇas, then having washed the feet (of the 
patron) in the maṇḍapa, the ritual intention for the śrāddha rite should be declared. Having 
provided this brief itinerary, the king resumes his extended citation of the Matsya Purāṇa, 
1287The analysis that follows summarizes page 70–81 of the Dānasāgara. B. Bhattacharya, ed., Dānasāgara of Ballālasena (Calcutta: Royal Asiatic Society, 1953–1956). 1288The mahādānapraśaṃsā, extracted from the Matsya Purāṇa, takes up all of page 70. 1289Interestingly, the particular ritual presented as the archetype takes Kṛṣṇa as the focus of worship in Vaiṣṇava rites. Ballāla’s commentary runs as follows (pg. 71): et[e]nādau nirvighnamahādānamakhasiddhyarthaṃ govindomāpativināyakapūjāṃ vidhāya brāhmaṇān vastrādibhir abhyarcya teṣām anujñāṃ gṛhītvā saṅkalpaśrāddhamaṇḍapādyārambha iti bodhitaṃ bhavati /

interjecting in his own two cents in just one terse remark.1290 When, after several pages of 
mostly proof texting spent defining the tulāpuruṣa rite specifically and providing the sets of 
Vedic and Purāṇic mantras that are to be used during its performance, Ballālasena returns to 
expounding upon the changing daily ritual program for the tulāpuruṣa, unsurprisingly he 
begins with a more detailed representation of the same preliminary rites he had alluded to 
earlier. This time, however, instead of a single line comprised of a series of discrete semantic 
discrete units joined by gerunds, the Dānasāgara presents us with a two-page gerund heavy 
run on sentence composed in the same style.1291 First (prathama), for the sake of the pūjā to 
Viṣṇu, Śiva, and Gaṇeśa, you need to lead off with scents and flowers and so forth; for the 
worship of the Brāhmaṇas, you begin by offering scents and garlands; for the sake of the 
intoning of auspicious speech, again garlands and scents are needed. Then, having purified the 
ground, for the sake of constructing a maṇḍapa, you need the materials to make the pillars; for 
the sake of the homa, you need the ṛtvij priests and the big vessels, along with ghee, kuśa grass, 
and copper pots. . . . On and on it goes in this manner like a medieval grocery list without the 
corresponding recipes that would make sense of how much of each ingredient is needed to 
achieve the desired outcomes. Since the text in no way provides us with step-by-step 
procedural guides of the sort you would need to execute even the simplest of the tasks it 
1290 Right before the definition of the grand tulāpuruṣa philanthropy is provided, he says (pg. 72) that there is a restrictive injunction (niyama) governing this rite that demands modifications based on the time and place of the rite’s performance (kāladeśayor): etena kāladeśayor niyamaḥ pratipāditaḥ / 1291 This is the prayoga (Ballālasena, Dānasāgara, 80–81) that outlines the sequence of ritual performances to be conducted on the first day. The text begins: prathamaṃ viṣṇuśivavināyakānāṃ pūjārthaṃ gandhapuṣpādisāmagrīvastranaivedyāni brāhmaṇārcanārthaṃ gandhamālyasāmagrīvastrāṇi vṛddhiśrāddhasāmagrīṃ svastivācanārthaṃ gandhamālyasāmagrīṃ sapaṭīkavāsoyugatrayaṃ suvarṇatolakatrayaṃ ca tīrthādiṣu pariśodhitāyāṃ bhūmau caturbhadramaṇḍapaghaṭanārthaṃ stambhavaṃśacālādikaṃ vedīkuṇḍaghaṭanārthaṃ iṣṭakāṃ cūrṇaṃ ca kuṇḍapārśvasthāpanārthaṃ kumbhacatuṣṭayam ṛtvijām aṣṭāv āsanāni homārtham aṣṭ[au] śobhanatāmrapātrāṇi sruvacatuṣṭayaṃ srukcatuṣṭayaṃ tilān ghṛtaṃ ca kuśaṃ yathopayogedhmasamidagnijvālanakāṣṭhadhūpapuṣpādi-sāmagrīṃ vedīsthadevapūjārthaṃ dvāpañcāśataṃ vastrāṇi pūjocitasāmagrīṃ ca. . . . /

prescribes, absent the extratextual knowledge of a learned elite, it is impossible to imagine its 
translation into real-world actions. 
In comparison, here is a taste of how, after having offered even more copious proof 
texts from the exact same sources, Hemādri introduces the very same material. 
Now this is the sequence of the application of ritual: 
From the day that is two days prior to the final day of the establishing of the philanthropic project (dāna), in the morning, the yājamāna, being well bathed, having enjoined the resolution (saṅkalpa), “I will establish this charity to [fill in the blank] (amuka), which may happen tomorrow (śvobhūte),” he, having worshipped Śiva, Viṣṇu, and Vināyaka, for the sake of warding off the collectivity (samūha) of obstacles [and] being approved by the Brāhmaṇas, should commence the ritual. 
And now, having done the Vṛddhiśrāddha, immediately after that, having enjoined the choosing of the ṛtvij and having worshipped them using the madhuparka injunction, having entered the maṇḍapa at the western door, in the afternoon, he should enjoin the incubation (adhivāsana) of the deity. The definitions of all these things, the madhuparka vidhi, the preparation of the homa fire, and the maṇḍapa will be given in the metarules (paribhāṣā).1292 
As we can begin to see, Hemādri has introduced two features into his approach to 
inculcating knowledge of ritual to his readers that are essentially without much precedent in 
the prevailing literature. First, he provides the ritualists (not just the patron) with a 
prefabricated written script the formalizes all of the spoken dialogue pronounced in the ritual. 
Instead of improvising their own appropriate Sanskrit sentences, all that each of the 
participants in the rites now will be required to do is to fill in the names of participants and the 
specific quotidian details pertaining to the specific rite and its intended outcome. In other 
words, we are provided with fixed ritual librettos with a pregiven theological and ideological 
1292Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi Dānakhaṇḍa, pg. 168–69: iha cāyaṃ prayogakramaḥ / uktakālānyatamadānapratipādanadināt pūrvedyuḥ prātaḥ susnātaḥ śvobhūte ’ham amukadānaṃ pratipādayiṣye, iti yajamānaḥ saṅkalpaṃ vidhāya pratyūhasamūhavighātāya śivaviṣṇuvināyakān sampūjya brāhmaṇānujñātaḥ karma samārabhet / atha vṛddhiśrāddhaṃ kṛtvā tadantaram ṛtvijvaraṇaṃ vidhāya, tāṃś ca madhuparkkavidhinā sampūjya paścimadvāramaṇḍapaṃ praviśyāparāhṇe ‘dhivāsanaṃ vidadhyāt, madhuparkkavidhikuṇḍa- maṇḍapādilakṣaṇāni paribhāṣāyāṃ draṣṭavyāni /

content. They are instantly legible to observing authorities in precisely the same manner as a 
prefabricated legal document. This also means that divergences or deviations from the 
expected norms can be quickly identified and called out. Hemādri’s other great innovation is 
his seemingly banal introduction of a new indexing strategy. As we can see at the end of this 
passage, when he is introducing a block of sequential ritual procedures, Hemādri regularly 
informs his intended readers precisely where they can find detailed instructions for performing 
all of the required individual ritual acts that make up any given vidhāna and also where they 
might find definitions for all of the key terms of art used in the ritual. Instead of presuming a 
general degree of erudition and skill, Hemādri’s dānapaddhati—as it would come to be called 
across the Deccan in subsequent decades—offers to any would-be professional Smārta 
Brāhmaṇa an all-in-one kit comprising everything a person needs to act as an authority. 
Before turning to the larger implications of this intervention, it is worthwhile to look 
very briefly at a few more examples illustrating the care, precision, and degree of control over 
content that Hemādri’s scripting of ritual provides. In the passage we have just examined, 
which offers a brief summary of the steps taken prior to the formal declaration of the ritual 
intention at the very beginning of the rite, Hemādri refers to the selection of the Ṛg Vedic 
ritualists—or ṛtvijs. In earlier sources where this requirement is given—for, remember, it is 
absent from the Piṅgalāmata—the choosing of these ritualists happens off stage and is treated 
in an entirely cursory fashion. The main point is simply the bare fact that they are needed. 
Hemādri, in contrast, not only covers the matter in excruciating detail, but he makes this 
selection of both the supplementary Vedic ritualists as well as the ācārya in whom the power 
to oversee the transfer of a gift or the bestowing of a land grant or the inauguration of a temple 
1436 
is vested into a publicly enunciated and thoroughly formalized part of the ritual, one which 
takes pains to disseminate to the public the credentials of everyone involved: 
With regard to that [tulāpuruṣamahādāna preliminary rites], this is the ritual application: 
“Today I will sacrifice with the sacrifice of the philanthropy to [fill in the blank]. With regard to that I choose you as the ṛtvij, who are the studier of the [fill in the Veda], who are [fill in the śarman], who have [fill in the gotra], to do the ritual consisting of the homa and so forth that are subcomponents of that.” 
“And, likewise, today, I sacrifice by means of the sacrifice that is the great philanthropy to [fill in the blank]. With regard to that, I chose you, as the ācārya, of the [fill in the Veda], who are [fill in the śarman], who have [fill in the gotra], in order to cause to be done and to do all the rituals that are subordinate components of that [main procedure].”1293 
As we can see, adhikāra, or ritual eligibility, has been reframed as almost exclusively 
a matter of very precise Vedic pedigrees. This is in spite of the fact that the majority of the 
rites that are to be performed by these ritual actors are not only at best nominally Vedic but 
primarily consist of the prefabricated ritual templates authored by Hemādri and provided, for 
the first time, in the Caturvargacintāmaṇi itself. In other words, the hyper-Vedicization of the 
requirements governing what makes a person eligible to perform these roles has at its 
foundation a demographic preference that is in no way connected to ability or knowledge base. 
In a similar manner, the adaptation of the rite from something that happens offstage to a 
performative examination and public proclamation of each ritualist’s credentials has as its aim 
the establishing and dissemination of new set of norms and expectations. From here on in, 
Hemādri is proclaiming, every transactional act of the sort that keeps the social order afloat 
1293Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi Dānakhaṇḍa, pg. 178: tatrāyaṃ prayogaḥ / adya amukadānasya yajñenāhaṃ yakṣye tatra tadaṅgabhūtahomādikarma kartuṃ amukasagotraṃ amukaśarmāṇaṃ amukavedādhyāyinam ṛtvijaṃ tvām ahaṃ vṛṇe / tathā adya amukamahādānayajñenāhaṃ yakṣye / tatra tadaṅgabhūtasakalakarma kartuṃ kārayituṃ ca amukasagotraṃ amukaśarmāṇaṃ amukavedādhyāyinaṃ ācāryaṃ tvām ahaṃ vṛṇe ityādi jñeyaṃ vṛto ‘smīti sarvatra prativacanam / 
1437will have to be punctuated by affirmations of the indispensability and universal applicability 
of performatively “Brāhmaṇa norms.” 
With these new steady affirmations of “Brāhmaṇical norms” comes a new 
epistemology, animated by a system of values antithetical to those we found in evidence in our 
earlier study of the world of pratiṣṭhā rites, a ritual repertoire closely linked with acts of 
philanthropy. If the zeitgeist envisioned by the Piṅgalāmata and its successors is liturgically 
and conceptually centered on representing the world as animated by hidden secrets, Hemādri’s 
Dānapaddhati can be seen as preaching a gospel of total transparency and accountability. 
Formally, what this means is that virtually all ritual activity is now to be performed in public 
and before an audience. Instead of there being parallel exoteric and esoteric systems of 
meaning and signification inscribed upon each event or ritual act, with the internal 
visualizations and theological objectives of the main acting, largely non-Brāhmaṇa, ritualists 
bearing little resemblance to the self-understanding of peripheral agents or spectators, the 
Dānapaddhati scripts procedures where the public declarations of ritual intent, the physical 
actions undertaken by the actors, and the visualized inner world of the ritualist offer seamless 
reproductions of each other. Here, for example, is a sample script for a relatively simple 
philanthropic rite, which involves the bestowal of a black deer skin blanket on a Brāhmaṇa. 
This here is the Dāna statement: 
Oṃ. Today, to [fill in the blank gotra], and so forth, I present to you this black antelope skin, which is placed on top of a blanket that is placed on top of kuśa grass. I give you a heap of oil seeds, which are covered with a set of clothes. I give you a golden horn, a silver horse hoof. I give you a silver tooth, a string of pearls. A golden nābha adorned with five gems, accompanied by fragrance and flowers, along with a vessel made of brass, of whom Śiva is the deity. It is further endowed with a fourfold set of vessels, full of honey, yogurt, ghee, milk, which are situated in the four directions. I, having [fill in the blank desire], [declare]—it [this property] is not mine. Today, to the person 
1438 
of [x gotra] and so forth, therefore, for the sake of establishing this gift of the black antelope skin, I bestow upon you this gold which is dakṣinā. It is not mine.1294 
Much like the deeds from the Lekhapaddhati we had examined back in chapter two, on 
one level, what we have here is a concrete commemoration marking the transfer of property as 
well as resources along with explicit documentation of the surrender of rights of ownership 
and the exact moment and circumstances when those rights were conferred. In other words, 
the state is providing a common framework for regulating and documenting financial 
transactions, however paltry their contents might be. Such declarations also offer a public 
itemization of everything used in the rite. As we know from other sources, including 
inscriptions, temples and other institutions typically kept records of their own possessions as 
well as a catalog of the expected ritual expenditure for different festivals. At the hands of a 
newly interventionist state inserting itself with increased frequency into the oversight and 
management of land grants and institutions of all sorts, one might well imagine that such public 
proclamations offering periodic delineations of expenditures could also provide the 
transregional bureaucracy with information for auditing institutional budgets. For example, 
consistent discrepancies between the amount of resources deployed during ritual events and 
festivals and during the annual assessment might alert the authorities to indications of 
embezzlement and or the misrepresentation of assets during tax collection season. 
Recollecting our discussion in the introduction, we should remember that philanthropy 
(dāna) is not merely a ritual but at once the organizing economic model of the day as well as 
1294Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi Dānakhaṇḍa, pg. 698: idam iha dānavākyam / om adya amukasagotrāyetyādi idaṃ kṛṣṇājinaṃ kuśoparigatakambalopari sthitaṃ vastrayugapracchāditatilarāśiṃ suvarṇaśṛṅgaṃ, raupyakhuraṃ raupyadantaṃ muktāphalalāṅgūlaṃ, suvarṇanābhaṃ pañcaratnālaṃkṛtaṃ gandhapuṣpānvitaṃ caturdigavasthitaghṛta-kṣīra-dadhi-madhu-pūrṇapātracatuṣṭayasahitaṃ sakāṃsyapātraṃ śivadaivataṃ amukakāmas tubhyam ahaṃ sampradade, na mameti, adya amukasagotrāyetyādi etat kṛṣṇājinadānapratiṣṭhārthaṃ dakṣiṇām idaṃ survarṇaṃ tubhyaṃ ahaṃ sampradade na mameti // 
1439 
an integral feature of the epistemic foundation of the medieval world. As Yājñavalkya has said, 
dāna is the highest dharma, and as we have seen in our explorations of the undying land grants 
found throughout the region, philanthropic endowments and their periodic renewal formed the 
social and legal building blocks that made possible Tantric sociality. Moreover, it was this 
social institution of inaugurating and then reaffirming land grants that provided much of the 
framework that renewed the ties of these Tantric imaginaries to dynastic regional polities. In 
short, by mandating a prescriptive standardization and formalization of dāna as rite as well as 
act of property transference, Hemādri, as the de facto head of an empire, is intervening in the 
workings of the region’s economy, changing the rules governing who can and cannot 
participate in the social and economic order of the day. 
At the same time that this new formulation renders the economic aspects of 
philanthropy transparent to outside observers, the same textual strategies make the exact 
parameters of the ritual accessible to the general public assembled in situ as well as to outside 
authorities. As the script makes clear, the ritual actor now effectively has to provide a running 
narration that accompanies each and every ritual act or manipulation of ritual materials. Thus, 
when he is transferring the deer skin blanket to its new owner, the donor not only declares to 
all the article in question, but makes explicit its physical position—placed on top of a blanket 
that in turn is resting on kuśa grass—vis-à-vis all the other items on the ritual grounds. Where 
the rite specifies the use of vessels of various kinds made of distinct materials and containing 
specific concoctions—the sort of thing that observers of the ritual would be unlikely to directly 
perceive themselves— every dimension of the arrangement is publicly declaimed in a manner 
that effectively renders the clandestine interpolation of the types of transgressive Śākta rites 
that had previously resided at the heart of the means and methods of production all but 
1440 
impossible. At the same time that pains are being taken to exclude such theologies as well as 
their promulgators, through the somewhat awkward integration of scholastic shorthand derived 
from Mīmāṃsā—such as the identification we see in this passage of the vessel being used in 
this rite as “having Śiva for its deity (devatā)”—Hemādri is crafting a formalized ritual 
repertoire abounding in rhetorical features that systematically align a new approach to ritual 
with a new mode of ritual analysis, both of which can only be accessed through the study and 
mastery of his Caturvargacintāmaṇi. 
That the values that animate these new techniques undermine the Śākta-inflected 
imaginary of Cāḷukya Deccan in general, but even more specifically are effectively antithetical 
to the peculiarly Maharashtrian Śākta cosmopolitanism and emergent public culture so central 
to the Seuṇa Yādava court well into the thirteenth century, is hardly an accident. Indeed, though 
such an interpretation is uncharitable as it does not take seriously Hemādri’s seemingly sincere 
commitment to the decidedly unorthodox theology we will encounter in detail in the next 
chapter, one is tempted at times to see Hemādri as having reverse engineered his system with 
the deliberate intent of rendering the old paradigm outmoded and no longer functional. Perhaps 
most importantly for our purposes, keeping in mind this sociological backdrop helps makes 
explicable one of our text’s most significant, surprising, and unheralded innovations: 
Hemādri’s reappraisal of the scope of Brāhmaṇical philanthropy. As we shall see, breaking 
from a consensus as old as the Guptas, and by this time deeply entrenched in the commentarial 
tradition on the Nārada and the Yājñavalkyasmṛti, our author offers a vision of Dāna that 
explicitly inhibits royal and individual patronage and financial support for non-“Hindu” 
traditions and non-Brāhmaṇa collectivities. 
1441 
Making sense of such developments demands a closer engagement with the framing of 
chapters 2 and 3 of the Dānakhaṇḍa itself. As we have already seen in regard to the 
Tīrthakhaṇḍa, and as both Aiyangar and Kane have noted in passing, Hemādri typically 
constructs the beginning chapters of each part of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi around a sizeable 
core of proof texts appropriated from the twelfth-century Kṛtyakalpataru of Lakṣmīdhara. In 
the case of the Dānakhaṇḍa, Hemādri even begins his own glosses by paraphrasing his 
predecessor, a state of affairs that has led the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, when it has been noticed 
at all by scholars, to be characterized as a derivative and unnecessary expansion upon an 
elegant original. What such a glib representation fails to recognize however, is that our author 
habitually deploys this inherited material in the service of new and radically distinctive 
conceptual ends. Sometimes, as we will see in a moment all it takes to instigate such a 
rectification of values is changing a single word. Just what is at stake and how our author 
engineers this shift will become clear to us when we place the largely parallel passages from 
the Kṛtyakalpataru and the Caturvargacintāmaṇi side by side: 
Kṛtyakalpataru: 
Devala: And now, I will explain the rules of gifting. The bestowing of wealth upon a prescribed recipient with a spirit of generosity (śrāddha) is designated as “gifting.” An analysis of that will now be stated: 
L: “Prescribed” means “taught in the scriptures.” 
D: Gifting is said to have two causes, six bases, six components, six effects, four kinds, three types, and three means of destruction. 
L: [Causes of Gifting:] Whether small or large, the size of a gift does not bring about its benefits, but rather the spirit of generosity and capability associated with a gift—indeed, only these two things cause prosperity or ruin.1295 
1295Translation of Lakṣmīdhara by David Brick. See David Brick, ed. and trans., Brahminical Theories of the Gift: A A Critical Edition and Annotated Translation of the Dānakānda of the Krtyakalpataru (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Oriental Series, 2015), 64. Emphasis added. For the Sanskrit text, see pg. 260: śrāddha śaktiś ca dānānāṃ vṛddhikṣayakare hi te / 
1442 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi: 
Now Devala [says]: What is called philanthropy is the bestowing of wealth, accompanied by śraddhā, to the prescribed recipient. 
H: The stated one means the one expounded in the śāstras. Namely, it is the bestowing of money unto a recipient—in other words, it is the relinquishing that culminates in the removal of one’s own ownership. 
D: It is endowed with two causes, six bases, six components, and six effects. Philanthropy has four types, it is three-fold, and has three means of destruction. 
H: By him himself was stated the elaboration on this: Whether small or large, the size of a gift does not bring about its benefits: 
H: Śraddhā and bhakti are known to be the two producers of the flourishing or destruction of philanthropic activity. Śraddhā is the mindset of believers. Bhakti is meditation prefaced by emotional attachment.1296 
Unmistakably, both of our authors introduce the topic of dāna with same quote from 
the Devalasmṛti: “philanthropy is the bestowing of wealth accompanied by śraddhā to the 
designated recipient.” That what we are looking at is direct textual dependence as opposed to 
a simple sharing of some canonical sources becomes inarguable when we attend to such details 
as the fact that both authors then open their commentary on this verse with an almost identical, 
and by no means self-evident, gloss on the past passive participle udita.1297 In Lakṣmīdhara, 
said gloss is the entire extent of his commentary on this portion of the text; he continues on to 
cite at length a long explication of the different factors that speciate philanthropy, presenting 
without interruption some of the very same quotes Hemādri will later interweave into his work. 
1296Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi Dānakhaṇḍa, pg. 13: tatra devalaḥ / arthānāṃ udite pātre śraddhayā pratipādanam // H: udite śāstranirūpite / arthānāṃ pratipādanaṃ nāma pātraṃ prati svasvāmibhāvāpādanaparyyantas tyāgaḥ / dvihetu ṣaḍadhiṣṭhānaṃ ṣaḍaṅgaṃ ṣaḍvipākayuk / catuḥprakāraṃ trividhaṃ trināśaṃ dānam ucyate / asya vivaraṇaṃ tenaivoktam / tatra dvihetviti / nālpatvaṃ vā bahutvaṃ vā dānasyābhyudayāvaham / śraddhā bhaktiś ca dānānāṃ vṛddhikṣayakare smṛte // śraddhā āstikyabuddhiḥ / snehapūrvam abhidhyānaṃ bhaktiḥ / 1297Lakṣmīdhara: udite śāstrapratipādite / Hemādri: udite śāstranirūpite / Brick, Brahminical Theories of the Gift, 260. 
1443 
Hemādri, in contrast, though addressing himself to the very same text, eschewing the 
privileging of textual exegesis as an end in itself, with pedagogy in mind breaks the materials 
up into digestible chunks and clearly states the purpose and nature of the philanthropic act. 
Since he is not a prisoner to the external demands of an exegete who is impelled to explain 
every unclear feature of the root text however tangential, he rapidly rattles off the traditional 
taxonomy of explicating dāna in terms of two causes, six domains, and six ripenings—all 
offered with further explanation—before getting to his “real point,” which is that the success 
or failure of philanthropic activity is essentially determined by the giver having śraddhā and 
bhakti. 
Bhakti, you may notice, is actually absent from the common recensions of our proof 
text. Undeterred, Hemādri simply adds it in, reducing the more common reading that we find 
in Lakṣmīdhara, śakti, in the secular sense of capability, to a mere afterthought.1298 Thus, with 
all the pieces now in place, our author has the materials on hand to harmonize his thinking in 
the realm of law with his wider theological program. In his superb dissertation, David Brick 
has noticed this peculiarity and proposed that Hemādri’s decidedly strange gloss of śraddhā as 
āstikyabuddhiḥ intends to affirm that the giver must believe in the efficacy of the philanthropic 
process itself.1299 As we will see momentarily, however, reading deeper into Hemādri’s corpus 
provides us with a simpler answer. Here, for example, is how our author addresses a similar 
conceptual concern in the opening section of his Kaivalyadīpikā, the oldest substantial 
commentary on the Bhāgavata Purāṇa, to which we will turn at length in the last chapter: 
1298Hemādri refers to the use of the lexeme śakti in place of bhakti as an additional reading (śaktir itipāṭhe śaktir audāryam). This is quite peculiar as śakti is itself the predominant if not exclusive reading present in all of the prior sources Hemādri tells us he had consulted, at least among our surviving sources. Śakti is also the interpretation consistently given by Ballālasena in his paraphrasing of this same discourse throughout the Dānasāgara. 1299See David Brick, Brahminical Theories of the Gift, 54–55, which continues the argument in the dissertation. 
1444 
The purpose is obtaining kaivalya. The subject matter is bhakti yoga. The qualification of the eligible person is purity (sattva) qualified by lack of self-interest; [adhikāra is] not [dependent on] caste, stage of life, and so forth. Envy is not enduring the greatness of others. Purity is being a believer (āstikatva).1300 
Succinctly, for Hemādri, notions of “faith,” eligibility for participation in religious life, 
and ontic purity of being are all but inseparable. If such purity is in part a matter of comporting 
oneself in accordance with what would later be called Vaiṣṇava dietary and social habits, at 
the same time it demands a sort of “mental hygiene,” what our author labels having the mindset 
of “being a believer,” as opposed to a nāstika. When we turn back to the Dānakhaṇḍa, we find 
unambiguous confirmation for this interpretation of the term in the following chapter in its 
discussion of unsuitable recipients. There we are told, “A knower of dharma should not offer 
[philanthropy], even once, to an unbeliever (nāstika) or a logician, or to any of the heretics 
(pāṣaṇḍa), or to someone who does not know the Vedas.”1301 Hemādri’s gloss on these 
passages, which tells us that a nāstika is one who is empty of the traces of the other or supreme 
world and that a logician is one who, on the basis of argumentation, challenges the existence 
of such a state, make explicit that his rejection of such social actors is fundamentally a matter 
of beliefs and values. Succinctly, though such notions are entirely absent from his sources, our 
author is imposing an ideological litmus test over what constitutes the boundaries of acceptable 
religion at the very same moment that the very same conceptual resources are being deployed 
in the service of excluding those social agents and religious modalities that fall outside the

disciplinary power.

As once again the raw materials on top of which Hemādri installs his interpretive 
project are inherited from Lakṣmīdhara, it is worth looking at how the Caturvargacintāmaṇi 
diverges from its sources. As Brick has shown us, Lakṣmīdhara dedicates most of the third 
chapter of the Kṛtyakalpataru to compiling what are mostly pretty prosaic praises of 
Brāhmaṇas, speciating them at great length in terms of their individual attainments and forms 
of merit. While Lakṣmīdhara is quite clear in communicating that as a class, Brāhmaṇas are 
the best recipients (satpātra) for dāna, from his perspective, such statements are by no means 
intended to exclude non-Brāhmaṇas from being fit vessels for philanthropy. It is perfectly 
acceptable to offer most kinds of things to Śūdras and other such folks, though you do not yield 
quite as much merit from doing so. In this spirit, he liberally cites a range of proof texts in 
favor of this position, a representative sampling of which we will quote here: 
Yama states: A gift to a non-Brahmin yields an equal reward; a gift to one who is a Brahmin in name only yields twice that; a gift to one who is learned yields one- hundred-thousand-times that; and a gift to one who has mastered the Vedas is infinite. . . . 
Bṛhaspati (14.10, 11–12) states: According to tradition, a gift to a Śūdra yields an equal reward and a gift to a Vaiśya twice that. A gift to a Kṣatriya, they say, yields three- times the reward, while tradition holds that a gift to a Brahmin becomes six-fold. . . . 
Yama says: It is said that a gift to a Śūdra yields an equal reward and a gift to a Vaiśya three-times that. They say a gift to a Kṣatriya yields six-times the reward, while tradition holds that a gift to a Brahmin becomes ten-fold. 
Dakṣa states: A man should give to any person who seeks him out and begs for the sake of a calamity, a disaster, or a debt or for the sake of his family—this is the prescribed rule for all gifts. . . . Whatever is given to a parent, elder, friend, gentleman, benefactor, indigent, pauper, or distinguished individual is fruitful. Indeed, one who desires prosperity should give gifts to indigent, poor, and distinguished individuals, for those who do not give gifts to such people are reborn as those who must live off others’ good fortune.1302 
Though indeed privileging Brāhmaṇas, Lakṣmīdhara and his sources thus embrace a

1446 
sort of catholic vision of philanthropy where, at least in regard to most types of philanthropic 
rites, being a “proper vessel” is not determined by and large by one’s caste, religious 
commitments, or ideological positions. The only types of people whom he specifically 
identifies as not serving as fit vessels for philanthropy, quite pointedly, are thieves, slaves, 
quack doctors, gamblers, frauds, as well as Brāhmaṇas who teach Śūdras the scriptures for a 
living (but not Śūdras themselves) or anyone who habitually displays a lack of integrity. In 
other words, he is making a qualitative and not a normative judgement. Indeed, while he shows 
little interest in scrutinizing the claims of Śūdras, who are after all both fit vessels for dāna as 
well as appropriate donors, provided they do not use Vedic mantras in their rituals, and even 
less concerned with the lower ranks of twice-borns, Lakṣmīdhara is quite invested in exploring 
the intricacies of the intra-Brāhmaṇa pecking order. Towards this end, he directs the reader’s 
attention to a curious passage, ascribed to the Śātātapasmṛti,1303 that identifies six-classes of 
“so-called Brāhmaṇas”: 1) the Brāhmaṇa who takes his wages from the king, 2) the one who 
is a professional trader, 3) the one who performs yajñas on behalf of many (in other words, 
who sells his Vedic rites), 4) the one who sacrifices on behalf of a village, 5) the one on the 
1303David Brick, Brahminical Theories of the Gift, 82. In actuality, Lakṣmīdhara’s Śātātapasmṛti shares its title but not content with the published work under that name, for the Śātātapasmṛti available to us is utterly dissimilar in tone and focus. Like many of the almost entirely unstudied upadharmaśāstras, it is a rather strange text, primarily concerned with the future karmic consequences of committing the mahāpātakas and upapātakas. Much of the work consists simply of a charming laundry list of hyper specific “if, then” formulations, matching consequence to karmic result. To cite just a few compelling examples, a person who passes off someone else’s words as their own will be reborn dumb, and the remedy for this in a future life will be to give another scholar copies of works of Nyāya and Itihāsa in manuscript. While a person who steals wool in this life will be reborn really hairy, a state of affairs that can be remedied by making a golden image of Agni and giving it to a Brāhmaṇa, in contrast, a person who steals silk will be reborn with an unmanly lack of hair, which is fixed for future births by giving a Brāhmaṇa a cow. If you have incestuous sex with your mother, next life you will be born with a vestigial penis. However, if you merely have licit sex in your teacher’s bed, in your next life, it will hurt when you pee. Sleeping with female ascetics causes kidney stones. Sleeping with your maternal aunt causes ulcers on the left side, incest with your paternal aunt makes them manifest on the left. On and on the text goes, without at any point expressing even a passing interesting in the examination and evaluation of different classes of Brāhmaṇas attested in the dharmanibandha literature. For the published edition of the Śātātapasmṛti, see Manmatha Nath Dutt, ed., The Dharam Shastra: Hindu Religious Codes (New Delhi: Cosmo, 1978–1979). 
1447payroll of a village or the payroll of a city, 6) the twice-born who does not observe the sandhyā 
rites at the three junctures of the day. All of these, it is said, should be regarded as the equivalent 
of Śūdras, who, once again, are still fit if not ideal vessels for receiving philanthropy. Without 
more context it is difficult to determine for certain what this passage originally was actually 
about, but one plausible reading is that represents the continuation of an ancient inter-Vedic 
quarrel expressing the hostility and anxiety of Yajur Vedic communities who champion a 
Śratua sacrifice oriented a model of the “triple Veda” over and against the largely Atharva 
Vedic advocacy for the purohita as Vedic ritualist par excellence. Such a reading explains why 
most of the so-called Brāhmaṇas identified in our passage are deemed suspect simply for 
performing large scale rituals on behalf of royal authorities or civic formations. 
Regardless of such niceties, for Lakṣmīdhara, the cited passage offers a transition into 
consideration of non-Brāhmaṇas as suitable vessels for philanthropy, albeit on a graded scale. 
The passage’s use of the term “non-Brāhmaṇa” as a term of art specifically referring to the six- 
fold classes of so-called Brāhmaṇas also enables Lakṣmīdhara to reconcile some contradictions 
in the calculus of force multiplying the merit derived from donations based on the statuses of 
the recipient. The problem runs as follows. Three key Dharmaśāstra proof texts say that by 
giving to a non-Brāhmaṇa, one achieves merit equal to the base line amount of puṇya stipulated 
by a scripture. So, if, for example, a specific philanthropic act is said to provide the donor with 
the merit from one hundred horse sacrifices, giving to a non-Brāhmaṇa would provide one 
hundred horse sacrifices worth of merit. The same text then goes onto to assert that, in cases 
where giving to a Brāhmaṇa is not stipulated by the text as a component of the ritual, one gets 
double that merit—two hundred horse sacrifices worth of puṇya instead the measly one 
hundred—for giving to a Brāhmaṇa. So far, so good. Where the trouble arises is that a greater 
1448 
variety of sources offer a more classic pattern of caste-specific escalation that substantively 
diverges from this norm. In these texts, where the donor type is not specified, the philanthropy 
to Śūdras produces merit equal to whatever is stipulated in the base form of a rite, philanthropy 
to Vaiśyas doubles that merit, and giving to Kṣatriyas triples it. If the recipient is a Brāhmaṇa, 
these sources say, you get six times the merit for your buck. The contradiction here is quite 
obvious—namely, does giving to a Brāhmaṇa merely double your merit or does it multiply it 
six-fold? Lakṣmīdhara’s solution to this not terribly pressing problem is to stipulate that where 
the first text is contrasting the relative merits of giving to a non-Brāhmaṇa versus a Brāhmaṇa 
and asserting that you only get double the merit, the text is not speaking of any non-Brāhmaṇa 
person, but exclusively the six-classes of “so-called Brāhmaṇas” identified by Śātātapa. In 
other words, rather than having to pick between these two seemingly conflicting standards for 
calculating karmic merit, he sets out to prove that there is no contradiction at all.1304 
Hemādri, as we should by now anticipate, takes this same set of proof texts, augmented 
with a few more of his own, and deploys the same rhetorical trick, taking the term “so-called 
Brāhmaṇa” out of Śātātapa and equating it with the other references to the “non-Brāhmaṇa” 
found in his other sources.1305 Departing markedly from Lakṣmīdhara, however, he equates the 
concept of the “non-Brāhmaṇa” (abrāhmaṇa), which is to be systematically equated with 
Śātātapa’s “so-called Brāhmaṇas” wherever that lexeme appears, not merely as linked to one 
discrete lexical item but as functioning as a conceptual unit with a plurality of synonyms. In 
fact, what Hemādri seems to be asserting is that, since as he will establish, for most acts of 
1304This clever tactic would be more convincing were it not for the fact that one of the proof texts he already cited—and which we began by reading, namely, the Yamasmṛti—has already differentiated the non-Brāhmaṇa from the Brāhmaṇa in name only. 1305This is redefinition is the chief focus of pg. 28–29 of the third adhyāya of the Dānakhaṇḍa of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, which we will analyze in some detail over the next few pages. 
1449 
philanthropy only Brāhmaṇas are the appropriate vessels, wherever in the proof texts a “non- 
Brāhmaṇa” of any sort is treated as a fit vessel for philanthropy—even when the referent used 
is one of the other varṇas or jātis—we need to understand the passage as solely referring to 
Śātātapa’s six-fold canon of “so-called Brāhmaṇas.’ In other words, when a passage says that 
“Śūdras get the same merit and a Vaiśya twice that, but a gift to a Kṣatriya. . . yields three 
times the reward,” the words Śūdra, Vaiśya, and Kṣatriya are all being used in a metaphorical 
sense. The actual topic under discussion is the relative virtues of donating to the different types 
of “so-called” Brāhmaṇas. It is these strategies that rather counterintuitively enable Hemādri 
to frame analysis of a compilation of passages whose plain sense conveys the message that 
Śūdras and the other varṇas are appropriate recipients for philanthropy in a manner that aims 
at radically circumscribing the participation of non-Brāhmaṇas in the real economy of 
medieval India. 
In these passages, when it comes to the non-vessels who are claiming Brāhmaṇa status for non-Brāhmaṇas, the designation of “being a vessel” has as its subject forms of dāna that are distinct from the dāna of giving cows accompanied by mantras and so forth: “When dāna is given to a ‘non-vessel’ preceded by [Vedic] mantras, then having, first severed the hand of the donor, he should cut off the tongue of the recipient”. . . . Because there is a prohibition on the conferring of the designation “vessel” in cases where cows and so forth are given preceded by the mantras, the representation of “being fit vessels” when it is applied to Śūdras and the like has as its scope of applicability [solely] philanthropy that entails the giving of food.1306 
It is important we begin to recognize that the framework that Hemādri is proposing 
here is no mere abstract aspirational scholastic exercise in proposing preferences but, as we 
shall soon see, is actively enforced by disciplinary power that has the backing of the state. This 
model effectively curtails Śūdras and other non-Brāhmaṇa agents from participating in the

most expedient means from accumulating non-perishable property, just as further stipulations, 
which we will not be examining in detail, all but prevent most of these same social agents from 
functioning as the primary class of philanthropic donors. As we have seen time and again 
throughout this study, non-Brāhmaṇa social formations under the guise of Kālamukhas and 
Mahāpāśupatas of various sorts, as well, of course, as Jains, were the dominant property- 
owning communities as well key makers of institutions, institutional cultures, and 
infrastructure throughout the medieval Deccan. Non-Brāhmaṇas were also largely responsible 
for funding these institutions and generating the lion’s share of religious merit. Thus, what 
Hemādri is proposing amounts to a radical redistribution of privilege, wealth, and resources 
that effectively dismantles the economies of his day. 
Now at first glance, one might be inclined to assume that what Hemādri is asserting 
here is nothing more than a reversion to a hardline affirmation of intrinsic Brāhmaṇical 
privilege. Something decidedly more interesting is going on, however, for Hemādri’s 
characterization of the “proper recipient,” the Brāhmaṇa, takes a rather unexpected form, 
offering a denaturalization of Brāhmaṇical privilege and that the very same moment that it is 
transferring disciplinary power and agency to a very particular type of Brāhmaṇa. Thus, just 
after offering the usual platitudes—there is no god equal to a Brāhmaṇa, there is no guru equal 
to a Brāhmaṇa, there is no injunction more authoritative than a Brāhmaṇa—our author starts 
invoking sources that drastically restrict the very nature of what “being Brāhmaṇa” means: 
“Neither caste (jāti), nor family (kula), nor the study of scripture, nor the śruti are the causes of “Being Brāhmaṇa,” O king. Conduct alone (vṛttam eva) is the cause of “Being Brāhmaṇa.” What is the benefit of lineage to a corrupt soul devoid of conduct? Do worms not arise in flowers that smell good? O king, there is not a single textual reading that is to be taken up exclusively! O dear one, seek out conduct—[after all,] even among the rākṣasas there is great erudition! 
1451 
What is the use of a lot of rehearsal as if one were a bad-minded actor? It [the Veda] is studied or heard by [any] one who practices the ritual [regardless of their character]. Just as, if one tastes milk or water that is inside a skull bowl, it is degraded on account of the fault [deriving] from [the] place [that it occupies] (sthānadoṣena), it is the same for scripture that is devoid of conduct (vṛttahīna). 
Therefore, O king, know conduct to be the defining characteristic of a Brāhmaṇa. One who knows the four Vedas but has bad conduct (durvṛtta) is remembered to be lower than a Śūdra. Truth, restraint, austerity, philanthropy, non-violence, restraining the senses, in whom these are seen, O Indra among kings—he is remembered to be a Brāhmaṇa.”1307 
Throughout this study, we have seen that across a whole host of social positions and 
levels of articulation, for at least half a millennium the dominant paradigm in operation 
throughout the medieval Deccan had embraced an episteme organized around context- and 
site-specific forms of knowledge and praxis. On a juridical level, these commitments had been 
translated into something akin to what the Anglo-American legalist tradition would be inclined 
to represent as a positivist vision of law, where what constitutes law is largely determined by 
the social facts on the ground as practiced by actual communities—and a pluralist vision of the 
nature of authority. When framed in terms of the philosophy of ethics, the sort of stances we 
keep encountering bear a family resemblance to what the philosopher and intellectual historian 
Isaiah Berlin has famously referred to as “value pluralism: “the conception that there are many 
different ends that men may seek and still be fully rational (for rational we might read logically 
internally coherent), fully men, capable of understanding each other and sympathizing and

1452 
deriving light from each other.”1308 Such pluralism denies there is any single all pervasive 
source of reasons either motivating or vitiating action. In doing so, it also necessarily rejects 
the existence of a single dominant value and standard for evaluation. Much like the evidentiary 
model we have seen at work in the evaluation of the claims staked by individual samūhas 
within the Indic legal system, these positivist visions of law assume that sources of value and 
internal standards for valuation are not absolute and universally true, but emerge within 
specific social and institutional bodies at documentable moments in sacred or secular time and 
that they are grounded in reasons that are best understood by people from within that 
community who have objectively mastered its canons of value. It is this confluence of ideals 
that renders internally coherent conceptual frameworks such as Bṛhaspati’s seminal invocation 
of a deśācāra where, “In the east, [people] are fish eaters and women are devoted to infidelity. 
In the north, the women drink liquor and they are to be touched by men while menstruating. . 
. . according to this conduct, these things are not demanding of punishment or expiation.” 
Within the tradition of Western political legal history, legal positivism and its various 
medieval antecedents find their counterpart in the principle of lex naturalis—natural law, a 
conceptual framework that views that legality is not a matter of observing and the enforcing 
the actual codes of conduct practiced by communities, but in making normative judgements 
based on abstract standards. As the humanist political philosopher John Locke wrote in 1620, 
effectively distilling several thousand years of Western discourse on lex naturalis: 
Natural law is a fixed and permanent rule of morals which reason itself pronounces and which persists. . . . firmly rooted in the soil of human nature. Hence human nature must needs be changed before this law can either be altered or annulled. . . . Since all men are by nature rational, and since there is harmony between this law and rational nature, all men in the world are morally bound by this law. . . . In fact it seems to me to follow that. . . if he is a man he is bound. . . to fulfill the things appropriate to rational nature 
1308Isaiah Berlin, The Crooked Timber of Humanity: Chapters in the History of Ideas (New York: Knopf, 1991), 11. 
1453 
in the same way that it follows. . . that a triangle. . . [must have] three angles equal to two right angles. . . . Furthermore, this natural duty will never be abolished; for human beings cannot alter this law because they are subject to it, and it is not the business of subjects to abrogate laws to their liking. . . . For, since God has made man such that these duties of his necessarily follow from his very nature, He surely would not alter what has been made and create a new race of men, who would have another law and moral rule.1309 
Just as it did for many of his intellectual predecessors, for Locke, that idea that “there 
is a fixed and permanent rule of morals,” “firmly rooted in the soil of human nature” by which 
human beings are obligated to abide forms an integral component of his theory of legitimate 
authority. As we see in this passage, the existence of a universal and rational canon of values 
that orders our existence makes it incumbent upon each and every person that they have a 
“natural duty” to submit to the sovereign authority that defends and enforces these intrinsic 
norms. Just as the permanent rule of morals in Locke’s representation is singular and 
unchanging, so too is sovereign authority, whether we are talking about God in his heaven or 
the king and his state upon the earth, unitary and without any “other.” 
Succinctly, what Hemādri has done is to reintroduce a normative theory of the nature 
of law into the world of Dharmaśāstra. But unlike his predecessors, he grounds this prescriptive 
vision not in the self-justifying authority of the Veda, but in a universal theory of ethics that 
makes moral comportment—good conduct—the determining factor in deciding whether any 
discourse, agent, or human activity has intrinsic value and should be treated as authoritative. 
As we will see at some length in chapter 11, as befits a theory of natural law, Hemādri’s 
discourse on ethical comportment is virtually inseparable from his ontology of purity (sattva) 
so as to render “being ethical or good” effectively the same thing as being legitimate or even 
1309John Locke, Essays on the Law of Nature: The Latin Text with a Translation, Introduction, and Notes; Together with Transcripts of Locke’s Shorthand in His Journal for 1676, ed. Wolfgang Leyden (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002). 
1454 
real. What this essentially means is that any divergence from what are now being proposed as 
all-encompassing ethical norms, what the positivist tradition had inclined to see as “site- or 
context-specific” emendations to the general rules—like when a Bengali is permitted his quaint 
customs of open adultery—is to be seen not as a difference that the authorities one must respect 
and protect, but as an abrogation of intrinsic duty nullifying an agent’s rights, authority, and 
privilege, regardless of his reputation or cultural patrimony, Vedic or otherwise. 
Apart from its vivid imagery and intrinsic interest, part of what is so astonishing about 
the otherwise unattested passage we have just been exploring is that the conduct (vṛtta) it has 
presented as the defining feature that makes someone a Brāhmaṇa has strong parallels with the 
ethicalized reimagining of dharma as a universal discourse—equally applicable to all four 
castes—for which, as we shall see when we turn to the next chapter, our author has so elegantly 
and forcefully advocated in the opening section of the Caturvargacintāmani. In fact, the two 
lists diverge only in that the universal dharma expected of everyone actually entails a greater 
more demanding range of virtues than are ascribed here to Brāhmaṇa-hood. What is being 
proposed here then, is something like a republic of virtue, in which the universalizing standards 
of a universal sāmānya dharma overturns all particularized domain-specific logics, including 
the various community-specific samayas and the pluralistic theory of property rights and 
sovereignty that made them possible, that animated an older Cāḷukya inflected world order. 
Thus, at the very same time that Hemādri sets out to drastically curtail the ability of Śūdras 
and other such folk to occupy a pivotal role in networks of circulation and exchange, he is also 
establishing an ideological litmus test for what constitutes a legitimate Brāhmaṇa whose 
authority should be respected. Unstained by any sustained contact with systems of knowledge 
that, by advocating untoward conduct degrade the intellectual and moral integrity of those who 
1455 
participate in them, the Brāhmaṇas in question have found a new source of guidance that helps 
them to lead upright moral and ritual lives. The source of guidance in question, of course, is 
none other than the Caturvargacintāmaṇi itself, which (especially in its original extended 
form) provides to its imagined reader a wealth of ready to use templates and resources that 
streamlines the degree of skill and knowledge necessary to execute or oversee a wide repertoire 
of socially and economically significant rituals. In essence, it offers itself as a guide for 
professionalizing Brāhmaṇas, on the spot, to assume the role of a new kind of Smārta dharma 
authority, ready to assume a host of functions—for which there were minimal precedents in 
the world of Dharmaśāstra—previously occupied by the very demographics they have 
displaced with assurance that they will have the complete backing of the Seuṇa state, morally, 
politically, and economically. 
As any vulture capitalist can testify, displacing entire classes of people from the key 
positions that they have traditionally held within the networks of circulation governing the 
transfer and movement of resources, ideas, people, and money, and dismantling long standing 
institutions liquifies previously frozen forms of capital, enabling its transfer to new 
communities and sites of accumulation. As we saw in the last chapter, well into the thirteenth 
century, far from being dominated by a Brāhmaṇical ecumene, the Seuṇa domains in 
Maharashtra as well as the borderlands comprising what are now parts of Karnataka and 
Telangana were a world where “pakka” Brāhmaṇas had to carve out an often relatively humble 
place for themselves in the shadow of Kālamukhas and other Śāktas who were intimately 
linked with royal and military power centers. To be Brāhmaṇa in this world—as opposed to 
being an initiated vīra—granted a person access to no private clubs and held no promise of 
privilege or substantial financial compensation for one’s activities. As this chapter has begun 
1456 
to make clear, in the middle of the thirteenth century, emerging from the heart of the Seuṇa 
court and the pen of a man who was often the kingdom’s de facto ruler, we see a radical 
reorientation of values and priorities that seeks to reestablish Smārta Brāhmaṇas as disciplinary 
agents, as authorities, and as the pillars of their communities at the expense of other 
demographics. A key part of what makes this utterly ambitious and socially disruptive 
interpretive project feasible in practical terms is that it enables a radical redistribution of 
resources, out of the hands of institutions and agents embedded within older Śākta-inflected 
ecumenes and into the hands of the expanding ranks of upwardly mobile “professionalized” 
Brāhmaṇas. That this sea change in values coincides with a staggering redistribution of real- 
world resources is made evident in many of Hemādri’s own verses, which celebrate his efforts 
as acting as a veritable mountain of gold to the Smārta community. Let us look at just two 
examples. By him, every day, 36,000 Brāhmaṇas, learned in the Veda and its aṅgas, were fed with rice, [rice which served] as the abode [housing] different types [of food,] stuff to be licked, sucked and savored, accompanied by a broth and endowed with relish and sweets, all of which are placed in an array according to the propensities of their various qualities. And he led them in an instant to supreme joy with a whole lot of gold strewn all about.1310 
By him, money was given beyond counting—[so much money] such that it made the courtyards belonging to whole clans of Brāhmaṇas glimmer from the wonderous rays [from the gold] that he had redirected away from taking entry into the treasury of the King. Praiseworthy for his lovely deeds, his good conduct and discrimination, Hemādri’s glory is made even greater by the thickness of his love for the beloved of Nanda (Kṛṣṇa), who is pleased by his hosts of intense vows.1311

1457In order to be viable, social revolutions have to enlist a demographically sizeable social 
base comprised of a class of people who are dissatisfied with their place in the current social 
hierarchy and possess socially significant skills. To the Brāhmaṇas of Maharashtra who were 
not revered on the basis of their initiations into ever more rarefied bands esoterica within the 
Mantramārga, used to be being also-rans once they stepped outside of their agrahāras, 
Hemādri held out the promise of real wealth and real influence. Clearly, he delivered. If, setting 
aside much poetic hyperbole, we take the concrete claims offered in his verses basically at face 
value, by sometime in the 1250s, it would seem that the Yādava state was feeding 36,000 
Brāhmaṇas a sumptuous feast every day and then showering them in gold. To help us orient 
ourselves to the scale of this endeavor, thinking comparatively, in the thirteenth century the 
city of Paris was the largest urban center in Europe. It had a total population of about 80,000 
people. In other words, every day, at Hemādri’s direction, the Seuṇa empire set out to feed and 
publicly reward a community of Brāhmaṇas just a bit shy of half of the population of Paris. Or 
if you prefer an Indic standard of measurement, albeit one that we can thus far not identify as 
extant in Hemādri’s own lifetime, Purāṇic chronicles that focus on the Koṅkaṇa, when 
speaking of the great deeds of the cultural hero of coastal Brāhmaṇas, Paraśurarāma, celebrated 
as unparalleled his accomplishment of settling 36,000 Brāhmaṇas along the coast of the 
western Deccan.1312 Such tales treat these quasi-mythical progenitors as the sires of virtually 
all of the subsequent lines of Brāhmaṇas in the region. Succinctly, whether we take his claim 
literally or otherwise, Hemādri presents himself and the state he represents as the most 
1312Though popularly ascribed to the Sahyādrikhaṇḍa, this story does not appear in the published edition of the text. The narrative in question, however, forms a central structuring feature of the early modern, possibly even sixteenth-century vaṃśāvali, the Keralotpatti.

cultural revolution. 
Hemadpanthi: The “Reformation” of Temple Culture under the Law 
In comparison to the many other things we do not know about the highly schismatic dynasty 
that called themselves the Śilāhāras—such as where precisely they came from, what language 
was spoken at their courts, or why they chose to call themselves “meat offering on a rock”— 
the peculiar rhetorical choices made by the king of Thane that he should live on in the memory 
of his people and its institutions almost exclusively in terms of the story of how his enemies 
effectively annihilated his kingdom without taking him hostage is, at best, a minor sort of 
mystery. Nevertheless, in the handful of copper plate inscriptions produced during the 
relatively long reign of Aparāditya I, erstwhile king of the northern Koṅkaṇa, as well as in the 
records produced his largely insignificant heirs, once one peels away the usual cacophony of 
rhetorically inflated birudas, the only concrete accomplishment assigned to this ruler by 
subsequent Śilāhāras is that “he was the king who lived.” As the Vaḍavalī plates, found on the 
outskirts of what is now the city of Vasai tell the story: 
There was a certain demon of the Andhaka [i.e., Yādava] dynasty by the name of Chittukka.1313 So that he could shatter the world, he dispersed/obliterated the assembled circle of the vasal lords [beholden to Aparājita]. When the gurus had “departed,” when the wealth of dharma was ruined, when the radiant abode [i.e., the palace at Sthānaka] was obliterated, when the entourage of the people at the ruined city had perished, along with the prosperity of the kingdom, it was him [just Aparāditya I] all alone—with one horse, and the pair of his arms, and a sword. 
Looking up from within the frenzied battle, [Chittukka] saw him. He [Aparājita] quickly caused that opponent to take flight. It was not known by [Chittukka] clearly, 
1313There is some discrepancy about the name of the king in question, for while the original editor of the plates, K. B. Pathak, in his edition renders his name as Chittunka, in V. Mirashi in his collected inscriptions of the Śilāhāras renders the name Chittukka. As neither name appears elsewhere in the documentary records, it is impossible to determine which reading is preferable. K. B. Pathak, “Art. XVI: A Śīlār Grant of Śaka 1049,” Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society Old Series 21 (1904): 505–516; V. Mirashi, ed., Inscriptions of the Śilāhāras (Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum 6): (Delhi: Archaeological Survey of India, 1977). 
1459 
how to fight or how to flee. From fear of him [Aparājita], having extracted his army [from the battlefield], [Chittukka] went to rest in the domain of the Barbarians.1314 
But for its substitution of the sword for the more typical machine gun and the absence 
of various large things exploding, the picture being painted for us here resembles nothing so 
much as an action movie from the 1980s. King Aparājita assumes the role that in the American 
century would be assign to a Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, or Jean Claude van Damme. The 
plot is simple. Our hero, his family and friends eliminated, the stability of his whole world 
destroyed, looks down upon the smoking ruin of the battlefield. As the sound of the symphony 
introduces the soon to be incessantly recurrent theme, tonally marking our protagonist’s 
vendetta, looking up from the battlefield, the eyes of his arch enemy meets those of our hero. 
The bad guy glowers. Our hero grimaces. The enemy gives a signal, turns away, and he and 
his hoodlums escape into the night. Sitting in the audience, given the hyperformalized 
conventions of the genre, we know these very same bad guys will be encountered later on as 
the film draws to its close. In keeping with the simplistic moral universe of Reagan’s America, 
we know for certain that, after wiping out his rival’s forces, our hero will track down his 
nemesis. He will confront him. Then, after avenging the deaths of his friends and family, he 
will kill the wicked man, perhaps by throwing him off a building or beating him bloody with 
his cold bare hands. The details are immaterial, for the narrative structure is predetermined and 
the message it conveys is that the moral arc of the universe bends towards justice, so long as 
justice arrives armed to the teeth.

Things worked out somewhat differently for poor king Aparājita, more commonly 
called Aparāditya I. It is true that over the next few decades, he managed to cobble together 
much of the territory that traditionally made up his ancestral domain, and by the end of his 
reign, though they were not entirely contiguous pockets of land paying him allegiance extended 
from the heartland of his kingdom—in and around what is now Mumbai—as far south as the 
caves at Panhale Ganj just a few hours from Kolhapur. As far as we can tell, however, he never 
again encountered, let alone conquered, the ferocious Chittukka who had laid waste to his 
world. Instead, sometime after the reoccupation of the Śilāhāra capital city of Sthānaka, located 
in what is now the city of Thane, the singular Aparājita—or as he called himself, “the Second 
Sun”—amidst the ruins of his palace, began to compose the Sanskrit treatise for which he is 
best remembered, an extended and often very acerbic commentary on the Yājñavalkyasmṛti 
entitled the Aparārka. Referring to the very passages that will soon occupy our attention, 
namely, the commentary on verse 1.7, which is concerned with determining what sort of 
authorities have validity, Alexis Sanderson has described the Aparārka as taking a 
“conservative stance,” and characterized Aparāditya as one “who devoted much learned effort 
to resisting the drift into acceptance of the initiated Śaivas” into polite society.1315 Based on 
such a representation, which arises organically from the rhetoric of the treatise itself, in the 
absence of any further historical details, a reader would naturally assume that the 
“conservative” Aparāditya I embodied the efforts of the social establishment to restore a well- 
worn status quo, newly infringed upon by upstart social climbers holding noticeable Śaiva 
1315Alexis Sanderson, “Tolerance, Exclusivity, Inclusivity, and Persecution in Indian Religion During the Early Mediaeval Period,” in Honoris Causa: Essays in Honour of Aveek Sarkar, ed. John Makinson (London: Allen Lane, 2015) 157, ftn. 3: “An outstanding case of this conservative stance is that of Aparāditya, a twelfth-century ruler of North Konkan, who devoted much learned effort to resisting the drift into acceptance of the initiated Śaivas in his long comment on Yājñavalkyasmṛti 1.7, the verse that lists all the valid means of knowing one’s religious duties (dharmapramāṇāni).” 
1461 
commitments. As we are beginning to see, however, our documentary records overwhelmingly 
speak to a very different sort of dynamic, one in which Aparāditya I and the values he 
champions stand at the geographical and conceptual periphery. Far from representing the status 
quo, as modern scholarship has supposed, Aparāditya’s hyper-Brāhmaṇism reads as a marginal 
force in the political and social realities of a western Deccan thoroughly dominated by the very 
sort of “initiated Śaivas” that he lambastes so vituperatively, and impotently, in his writings, 
among whose ranks one can indisputably include the enemies who levelled his kingdom. 
As for the “demon” Chittukkarāja, though history knows him primarily by another very 
different name, he went on to what at the time would have seemed a much more illustrious 
political and military career. Having laid waste to the heartland of the kingdom of this minor 
northern rival, after taking everything of value one could carry away, including many slaves 
and prisoners, the person historians typically refer to as the Kadamba king Jayakeśin II—son- 
law of the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya king Vikrāmaditya VI—would have boarded his vast fleet of war 
ships and began the long journey home down India’s western coast.1316 Most likely, as 
Aparāditya I himself suggests, Jayakeśin and his armies would have first laid anchor eighty 
miles to the south of Thane at the port city of Chaul in modern Raigad district. Just as our 
inscription speaks of a domain of the barbarians (mlecchāśraya), at this time Chaul was under 
the control of an Arab merchant colony, whose mercenaries the Kadambas would often employ 
against their enemies. His armies fed and the storehouses of his ships refurbished, booty in 
hand, Jayakeśin and his army would have set a course for the Kadamba capital of Candrapuri, 
modern day Chandor in the state of Goa. It is here that our story gets interesting, for, as Mark 
Dyczkowski has shown at great length in his multivolume introduction to the Kumārikā 
1316For this identification as well as a profile of this ruler and his relationship to the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas, see S. L. Shantakumari, The Kadambas of Goa and their Inscriptions (Delhi: Agam Kala Prakashan, 2015), 62–67). 
1462 
Khaṇḍa of the Manthānabhairava Tantra, not only do the Śākta tantras of the Western 
transmission treat Candrapuri in the Koṅkaṇa as the last dwelling place (veśmān) in the age of 
kali of the goddess Kubjikā in her form as the mother of the Koṅkaṇa (Koṅkaṇāvva), but they 
identify the Kadamba kings themselves as numbering among the Śākta siddhas responsible for 
the transmission of her teachings throughout the Deccan.1317 
It is against this very different backdrop that we must reassess the expected 
elocutionary effect of a minor regional ruler—one moreover who has recently lost most of his 
kingdom—penning a diatribe questioning the legitimacy of Tantric scripture, Tantric 
personhood, and the construction and maintenance by Tantric practitioners of Tantric temples 
and institutions. What this wider historical context renders transparent is that Aparārka’s voice 
1317See for example Mark Dyczkowski, ed. and trans., Manthānabhairava Tantra: Kumārikā Khaṇḍa, Introduction Vol. 3 (New Delhi: DK Printworld, 2013), 300–306. See also Dyczkowski, Manthānabhairava Tantra, Introduction Vol. 1, 489–490, which tells of the conversion of the Vajrayāna adept Vajrabodhi, purportedly the rājaguru of the Kabamba kings of Candrapur, to the Kubjikā Tantras by Vṛkṣanātha/Siddhanātha. Specifically, in both the Ṣaṭsahāsrasaṃhitā as well as the Yogakhaṇḍa of the Manthānabhairava Tantra, the siddha called Śaṣṭhanātha, the first disciple of the siddha Vṛkṣanātha who begins the transmission of the teaching in the present age, is explicitly equated with a Kadamba king named Śaṣṭhadeva, about whom several stories are then told and who is credited with the establishing of the goddess at her home in the city of the moon in the Koṅkaṇa. 
Now, we know of two Kadamba kings with this very same name. The first of them, Śaṣṭhadeva I, is known to us only from certain Kadamba vaṃśāvalis, though after the dynasty becomes established, many of these begin to omit him entirely, posing the possibility this king might well be mythical. In any case, this Śaṣṭhadeva allegedly ruled from 998–1013 CE, a somewhat problematic proposition as these same dates would encompass in their entirety the period of rule ascribed to his son and successor Nagavarma as well as Nagavarma’s son and successor Gūvaladeva I (c. 980–1005 CE), the first Kabamba King for whom we have proper documentary records. It is Gūvaladeva, incidentally, who established the dynasty’s connection with the Arab merchants at Chaul, for it seems they rescued him after his ship, which was making pilgrimage to Somanātha, was lost at sea. Gūvaladeva’s own heir was Śaṣṭhadeva II, famed for his piety, whose long rule and considerable influence render him a more plausible candidate for the Śaṣṭhanātha of the Kubjikā Tantras. In his inscriptions, Śaṣṭhadeva, the great-grand uncle of Jayakeśin II, is celebrated for making a joint pilgrimage to Somanātha in Saurashtra and then Kolhapur in the southern Koṅkaṇa, with explicit intent that he would pay homage first to the god Mahākāleśvara and then to his consort Mahālakṣmī. In other words, even without the additional corroboratory evidence provided by the Śākta texts of the Western transmission, we have ample reason to accept that the Kadambas in the eleventh and twelfth centuries had aligned their dynasty with the authority of an elite Kaula tradition into which the ruling monarchs would have been at the very least nominally initiated and that this is taking place at the very same moments when the Kadambas have established strong ties to the major source of political authority in the western Deccan, the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas. See S. L. Shantakumari, The Kadambas of Goa and their Inscriptions, as well as S. G. Kadamb, Sources of History of the Kadambas of Goa Inscriptions (Panjim: Broadway Publishing House, 2013). 
1463 
speaks to us from a position of vulnerability instead of strength, expressing the views of a 
heterodox minority and not the “mainstream.” This is a state of affairs that diverges radically 
from the position Hemādri’s Caturvargacintāmaṇi, its prescriptive vision wedded to a 
powerful state, would assert for itself a mere century later. 
The ostensible occasion for Aparārka’s commentary, which runs dozens of pages, is a 
single verse in the Yājñavalkyasmṛti that sets out to delineate “the foundation of dharma.” As 
we shall see in the next chapter, this is very same textual locus upon which Hemādri will anchor 
a key part of his own in many ways very different hegemonic assertion of a new Brāhmaṇical 
dharma. For this reason, it is worth taking a moment to orient ourselves to the issues at hand. 
Against Gautama, who spoke solely of vedamūlatva as dharma’s foundation, Yājñavalkya 
proposes that dharma can be founded on the 1) śruti, 2) smṛti, 3) sadācāra, as well as 4) that 
which is pleasing to one’s own self (svasya priyam ātmanaḥ). In the Mitākṣarā of 
Vijñāneśvara, composed, we should remember, in the court of the father-in-law of Aparāditya 
I’s arch enemy, the verse in occasion is of minimal interest, warranting just a few lines of 
prose, two supplementary proof texts, and a series of short inherited glosses. Vijñāneśvara 
treats śruti as meaning the Veda (śrutir vedaḥ) and Smṛti as referring to the Dharmaśāstra, 
interpretations he justifies with a well-known citation from the Mānavadharmaśāstra (śrutis 
tu vedo vijñeyo dharmaśāstraṃ tu vai smṛtiḥ).1318 Somewhat less straightforwardly but still 
none too unexpectedly, the third component—sadācāra—Vijñāneśvara interprets as the ācāra 
practiced by the śiṣṭas (satāṃ śiṣṭānām ācāro ‘nuṣṭhānam). For our purposes, it is this last 
interpretation that is the most important, for it stakes a position that essentially legitimizes any 
form of social practice so long as it is well known that it is practiced by highly respected 
1318Mānavadharmaśāstra 2.10. 
1464 
Brāhmaṇa authorities. As we have seen time and again, upon such foundations of clever 
exegetical strategies was the Tantric social imaginary built. It is precisely this position that 
Aparārka sets out to refute vigorously and at great length. The last element, originating with 
Manu, carves out a space for individual acts of the human will to be seen as bearing merit, a 
position that Vijñāneśvara basically accepts and Aparārka, as we are about to see, contorts to 
mean something entirely different. With this in mind we can begin to turn to Aparāditya I’s 
commentary. 
On that matter, when it comes to the agnihotra and so forth, Śruti is the root of certainty. Smṛti [is the root of certainty for] varṇāśramadharma and so forth, [and] good conduct (sadācāra) for the holāka [festival] and so forth. An action is said to have “satisfaction of the mind” when it is enjoyed as delimited by satisfaction of the mind. As, for instance: “When a certain action is done, there would be a heaviness of his mind, regarding that [set of circumstances], one should perform austerity until it causes satisfaction.”1319 
In redefining the canon of a nascent “Brāhmaṇical” religion as comprised not of texts 
open to reinterpretation but of discrete practices, ideological stances, and events, Aparārka is 
already departing liberally both from contemporary interpreters and from the inherited 
tradition. Since the authority of the Veda is unchallengeable and yet at the same time much of 
what the Veda contains and prescribes departs substantively from an emerging vision of what 
it meant to be Brāhmaṇa in the early centuries of the next millennium, the scope of the Vedic 
must be confined to a recognizable set of ritual performances. In a similar spirit, as the canon 
of “accepted” Smṛtis has over the centuries expanded to incorporate textual authorities, such 
as the Śivadharmaśāstra, that advocate for values and practices that provide legitimacy to the 
very religious modalities Aparāditya I is about to condemn, the category of “remembered 
1319Aparāditya, Aparārka, pg. 9: tatrāgnihotrāder niścayamūlaṃ śrutiḥ, varṇāśramadharmādeḥ smṛtiḥ, holākādeḥ sadācāraḥ yat karma manasas tuṣṭiparicchinnatayā vidhīyate tasya manastuṣṭiḥ / yathā— yasmin karmaṇy asya kṛte manasaḥ syād alāghavam / tasmiṃs tāvat tapaḥ kuryād yāvat tuṣṭikaraṃ bhavet // iti / 
1465 
tradition” (smṛti) must be taken to as referring not to a class of texts, but to specific doctrinal 
stances, epitomized by the acceptance of varṇāśramadharma, amiable to our author's 
perspective. Perhaps most importantly, instead of reading sadācāra as synonym for the 
conduct of the śiṣṭas, drawing upon arguments in Śabara’s Bhāṣya on the Jaimini Mīmāṃsā 
Sūtras, Aparāditya equates good conduct with a hyper-delimited set of “popular” festival 
events that find mention in the Vedic corpus but whose means of performance is never outlined 
in these works. For the Mīmāṃsā tradition, as epitomized by holāka, the predecessor of the 
modern festival of Holi, the specific delineation of a discrete number of' “acceptable” non- 
Vedic festivals that find mention in the Veda has as its more fundamental intended meaning a 
blanket prohibition on the celebration of other sorts of “local” religious festival by pious 
Brāhmaṇa authorities. 
Reinscribing sadācāra with this hyper-delimited meaning has two other consequences 
that will prove absolutely essential to the Aparārka’s attempts at delegitimizing the Tantric 
world. The choice effectively removes from consideration the textual foundations for the 
tradition of legal pluralism, which treats community- and site-specific codes of conduct (ācāra) 
as legitimate sources of dharma, and devolves deliberative authority over those varied ācāras 
to a range of community-specific agents, many of whom are non-Brāhmaṇas. Just as 
significantly, Aparāditya is seeking to erase one of the mainstays of the classical Dharmasūtras, 
namely, the very notion that dharma can be discerned through observing the conduct and actual 
practices—the śiṣṭācāra—of learned and respected Brāhmaṇa authorities operating in the real 
world. For Aparāditya, this conceptual choice is absolutely indispensable, for “the real world” 
he lives in abounds in illustrious lines of Brāhmaṇa authorities of impeccable pedigree who 
are also initiates in the Śākta and Śaiva Tantras. 
1466 
Now that he has redefined the legitimate sources for knowing dharma, Aparāditya I is 
ready to turn to his main task in this part of his commentary, the delegitimization of Tantra. 
Vyāsa says: “By those who are desiring to obtain purification by/of dharma, nothing other than the Vedas is needed. The cause of dharma is pure, everything else is called mixed.” 
A: “Purity” means the state of not being mixed. “Dharma” means certainty about dharma. “Pure” means not flawed. “Mixed” means that in which flaws have been brought into being.1320 
“Now, that is the supreme dharma, which is learned from the Vedas. That which is remembered in the Purāṇas and so forth is known as the lower [dharma]. One should practice with effort the ritual action that was remembered long by the sages, the best of the knowers of the meaning of the Vedas, but avoid what is forbidden by them. For, one should not deliberate about the dharma that was shown, out of compassion for the welfare of the worlds, by those knowers of the truth of the meaning of the Vedas. Even if there is ignorance about the meaning of the Vedas when one cognizes it for oneself, what doubt can men have when it is certified by the sages? Whatever would denote dharma other than that, know from a good distance such a thing is understood to have delusion as its foundation.”1321 
Aparāditya I’s doctrinal stance here is as transparent as it is self-serving. In the 
hierarchy of sources for knowing about dharma, the knowledge we get from the Vedas about 
ritual performance resides at the very top and our access to it is entirely mediated through the 
knowers of meaning of the Veda, namely, Mīmāṃsakas and perhaps Vedāntins. This entire 
body of knowledge not only overrides all other sources for knowing dharma, but it itself cannot 
be questioned or made the subject of “deliberation.” Following his proof text, Aparāditya I 
concludes by asserting that all of the other things that call themselves sources for knowledge 
about dharma—which is to say a good portion of even what the textual mainstream of śāstra 
1320Aparāditya, Aparārka, p.9: vyāsaḥ— dharmaśuddhim abhīpsadbhir na vedād anyad iṣyate / dharmasya kāraṇaṃ śuddhaṃ miśram anyat prakīrtitam // śuddhir asaṃkīrṇatā / dharmasya dharmaniścayasyety arthaḥ / śuddham aduṣṭam / miśraṃ saṃbhāvitadoṣam // 1321Aparāditya, Aparārka, pg. 9–10: ataḥ sa paramo dharmo yo vedād adhigamyate / avaraḥ sa tu vijñeyo yaḥ purāṇādiṣu smṛtaḥ // vedārthavittamaiḥ karma yat smṛtaṃ munibhiḥ purā / tad yatnena samātiṣṭhet tanniṣiddhaṃ tu varjayet // te hi vedārthatattvajñā lokānāṃ hitakāmyayā / pradiṣṭavanto yaṃ dharmaṃ taṃ dharmaṃ na vicārayet // vedārtho yaḥ svayaṃ jñātas tatrājñānam bhaved api / ṛṣibhiś niścite tasmin kā śaṅkā syān manīṣiṇām // etebhyo ‘pi yad anyat syāt kiṃcid dharmābhidhāyakam / taddūratarato viddhi mohas tasyāśrayo mataḥ // 
1467has considered to be sources for dharma knowledge—are illegitimate and must be entirely 
discounted. It is on this doctrinal foundation that our author now seeks to comprehensively 
demonstrate, through what he imagines to be rigorous logical argumentation in the manner of 
a philosopher, that the traditions of the Atimārga and Mantramārga must neither by studied nor 
practiced by any human agent. Towards this end, he proposes, entertains, and then discards a 
series of distinctive pūrvapakṣas that set out to defend the legitimacy of Tantric knowledge as 
having sanction in orthoprax canons delineating ritual obligations. Aparāditya I is not a 
particularly brilliant stylist nor is he a well-organized polemicist; indeed, at times it simply 
seems like he is jotting down a whole range of potential objections to his opponents’ positions 
and has not even bothered to place them coherently in sequence so as to make a convincing 
argument. These are features of his discourse that may well suggest that the Aparārka actually 
was composed by the king himself and not by some pandits on his behalf. For this reason, our 
present purposes will be best served distilling his argument down to a few key points. 
Aparāditya I really hits his stride as a polemicist when he turns to dismantling quite 
specifically the arguments in support of the authoritativeness of what he calls “Śaiva” 
knowledge. In essence, the Aparārka identifies, in order of priority, three major ways in which 
Tantric knowledge diverges from the norms preferred by the vituperatively vocal but decidedly 
minority Brāhmaṇa viewpoint he represents, and his construal has much to tell us about the 
social perception of Tantric knowledge systems and their practitioners by outsiders. First and 
foremost, our author objects to the core claim that tantric initiation—dīkṣā—confers a change 
in caste status that has real-world social consequences. His lengthy attempts at refuting this 
idea, and with it the very idea of Śaiva identity as legitimate, offer what is one of the richest 
intellectual moments in the whole treatise. Second, our author sees the Tantras as perpetuating 
1468 
and normalizing to an unprecedented degree acts of ritual violence, especially through sorcery, 
as well as the ritual use of transgressive substances, which he asserts is forbidden in the kali 
yuga. Finally, our author seeks to query the claims that because some of the doctrinal and 
practice elements found in these texts correspond to what we find in the Veda, we can readily 
accept whatever “innovations” these revealed texts might offer that do not explicitly conflict 
with Vedic knowledge. For our purposes, we will confine ourselves to engaging with the first 
of these arguments. In this spirit, let us begin with our author's arguments regarding initiation 
and caste: A: When it comes to the worshipping of the gods and so forth, only the procedure that is well known from the Narasiṃha Purāṇa and so forth should be taken up, and not others. Thus, this is to be understood regarding dīkṣā as well. For, in the dīkṣā that is well known in the Purāṇas, there is no purification of caste. However, in the Śaivāgamas, [it is said:] 
“First is the stationary class, then are the things creep. The third is the class of birds, and the fourth is the class of hunted animals. The fifth is the class of domesticated animals. The sixth is the Untouchables. The seventh is the class of Śūdras. The eighth is the class of Vaiśyas. The ninth is the class of Kṣatriyas and the tenth are known of as Brāhmaṇas. These classes are purified by Śiva, the Lord of jātis.” 
A: By this statement and so forth, by the demonstration that there is purification [of caste], there is as a consequence non-eligibility [of the purified ritual agent] for Śrauta ritual. “The Brāhmaṇa should establish the fires,” “the king should sacrifice with the rājasūya,” “the Vaiśya should sacrifice with the Vaiśyastoma”—by these and so forth, Vedic ritual operates only in regard to someone possessing a class (jāti).1322 
Confirming what we have been arguing throughout the present work, namely, that the 
teachings of the Śivadharmaśāstra, as well as the receiving of dīkṣā were quite regularly 
construed as having a concrete real-world impact that rendered those who were governed by

1469 
these strictures no longer subject to the regime of varṇāśramadharma, Aparāditya I seeks to 
contrast the acceptable modes of initiation taught in other, often Vaiṣṇava sources, with this 
disruptive “Tantric” innovation. Whereas the Tantras themselves, in teaching that “dīkṣā 
liberates,” ontologically as well as sociologically, for through it Śiva either makes one become 
a Brāhmaṇa or purifies one of caste identity entirely, saw such intervention as emancipatory, 
Aparāditya asserts that while such initiations do have real-world consequences, their actual 
impact is to render the initiate socially illegible and to inhibit his participation in Vedic ritual 
of any sort. Since, so he suggests, all Vedic texts specify specific marked identities of caste 
and stage of life as being governed by their ritual injunctions, the second one is “purified” by 
Śiva’s touch or glance, even if he started out a Brāhmaṇa, a person is stripped of the very 
identities that were the foundation of their original eligibility for performing the rituals. 
In keeping with our author’s rejection of the positivistic legal pluralism upheld by the 
mainstream of the Dharmaśāstra traditions most evident in the Deccan, including the 
Yājñavalkyasmṛti itself, in which a multiplicity of ācāra can serve as meaningful source for 
knowledge about dharma, the other key portion of our author’s polemic about the implications 
of Tantric ideas about caste sets out to refute the very idea that one can meaningfully designate 
any group of people as “Śaivas,” which is to say that there exists any social demographic for 
whom the practice and study of Tantric knowledge might be appropriate. 
[PP] Now one might object, just as it is the case that the Vedas and the other śāstras operate in regard to some certain limited group of people, the Śaiva and other similar śāstras should be taken in that same way as pertaining to those possessing a certain caste—Śaivas and so forth.. 
A: [To that we say] no. [For, it is said:] 
“That one of whom the injunction that has arisen, by means of the mantras, beginning with the anointing and ending with the cremation ground, of him there is eligibility in regard to this śāstra and not of any other.” 
1470 
A: Thus, by this statement and so forth it is shown by Manu and others that only twice- borns are eligible in regard to their own śāstras, and not so for Śaiva Brāhmaṇas with regard to the śāstras of the Śaivas and so forth. 
[PP] Let it be the case then, that a Śūdra is eligible with regard to the Śaiva and other 
śāstras. 
A: No. Because this is not understood to be the case with regard to Smṛtis and other śāstras. And furthermore, there is no such thing as a Śaiva by caste towards whom might be addressed a certain Śaiva śāstra. However, according to Pāṇini’s sūtra (4.3101), by applying the suffix aṇ, “Śaiva” means the śāstra that has been spoken by Śiva. And from the same base word, “Śaiva,” one reapplies the suffix aṇ, thus “Śaiva” means “one who studies that [i.e., the śāstra of Śiva]. Then, by applying luk [which erases the previous function only in this particular case], one who knows or studies the Śaiva śāstra is a “Śaiva.” Thus, we have the Pāśupatas and others. 
Since, thus, the Śaiva and other such śāstras do not by nature operate with regard to a certain delimited group of people, acquiring [this knowledge] is like seeing pictures in the clouds. [In other words, it is not a real form of knowledge acquisition]. That being the case, it is to be abandoned with regard to practice.1323 
Clever scholastic maneuvering aside, again it is important for us to recognize that 
Aparāditya I’s argument is founded upon claims that in the medieval Deccan most authorities 
would have considered rather questionable. As we saw in chapters two and three, the ideas that 
disputes should be adjudicated by people who belong to the communities under discussion and 
not by outsiders, and that collective social formations, whether defined by theology, caste, or 
profession, should be governed according to the principles outlined in “their own śāstras,” 
were widely accepted textual norms held in common both by the living traditions of 
Brāhmaṇical Dharmaśāstra descending through Yājñavalkya as well as Tantric and other

“heretical” ecumenes. Even more importantly, as we have seen many times throughout this 
study, these idealized textual prescriptions largely match up with the state of affairs reflected 
in our documentary records and material cultural resources. In contrast our author’s preferred 
notion that only twice-borns have a right to consult and be governed by “their own śāstras” as 
late as the twelfth century seems at best to have represented a minority position confined to a 
specific textual corpus and largely absent from the documentary record. Ironically, the 
pūrvapakṣin’s second suggestion, also deflected by our author, that the Tantra as knowledge 
system is the religion of Śūdras, while only occasionally represented in our documentary 
record, will actually become the preferred Siddhānta of the more “inclusive” dharma traditions 
of early modern north India, such as the Śūdrakamalākara of the Maharashtrian Brāhmaṇa 
Kamalākara Bhaṭṭa. In contrast, outside of a minority of Vaiṣṇava sectarian theologians, 
Aparāditya I’s preferred stance—that no one is eligible to become a Śaiva—would continue to 
find few adherents among the emerging tradition of Smārta Dharmaśāstrin ritualists that would 
dominate elite early modern knowledge production, especially in Sanskrit, on the subcontinent. 
If being Śaiva, our author suggests, is intrinsically illegitimate, the sort of practices 
these dubious texts put into circulation are at least equally disconcerting. From the perspective 
of an outsider looking inward, the Mantramārga seems to be offering two concrete products 
that influence the lives of non-participants in these knowledge systems. The first of these is 
black magic,1324 and the second the production of material culture. Drawing upon a range of 
1324 “One should offer liquor that is devoid of mead,” and so forth, is remembered. Elsewhere, it is thought, concerning the kali yuga: “Celibacy for a long time, and bearing a kamaṇḍalu, marriage from sagotra or sapiṇḍa, and likewise cow killing, sacrificing horses and men, liquor—these are to be avoided by twice-borns in the kali yuga.” A: Because liquor and so forth are denoted in the Brahma Purāṇa, etc, as generally being to be avoided, by this, the offerings to [the goddess] Caṇḍikā and so forth are “commented upon.” As for what was stated in the Kālikā Purāṇa concerning the injunction for ointment: “Having made it in the ghee from human fat that is enclosed in a skull, likewise, when there is an eclipse of the moon or sun, then having taken up the unction, the discerning one should anoint the eyes, and he should bring Indra under his sway,” and so forth. “Now, one who desires to kill the enemy, having kindled a fire with wood from the cremation ground, should perform one 
1472 
classic textual resources, including the Śabarabhāṣya and Manu, the Aparārka sets to establish 
that in the present age, the use of transgressive materials in ritual is prohibited and deploying 
of ritual magic against one’s enemies brings about a fall into untouchability. But while the 
lurid details he has culled out of various lost Tantras offers us a candid glimpse of why 
outsiders to the Tantric knowledge systems would have been quite justified in holding the 
practitioners of these sorts of rites in abject horror, taken as a polemic here again, Aparāditya 
I has offered up a rather stale argument that any reasonably talented rival could readily rebut 
simply using passages from the Tantras themselves. Thus, for example, the very same grounds 
for discounting magic acts found the Tantras would prove equally applicable to the Atharva 
Veda in either of its recensions, both of which abound in almost exactly the same sort of 
offensive magical rites explicitly directed at parallel ends. 
Just how unpopular the Aparārka’s agenda must have been is laid bare when we turn 
to the second dimension of our author’s searing critique of the social consequences of Tantric 
normativities, namely, his discussion of the dominance of the world of material cultural 
production, especially the construction industry, by those pernicious Śaivas and their systems. 
In this case, however, faced with what seems to be a cold hard reality that the very technology 
that makes possible the production of material culture is largely derived from texts reflecting 
thousand oblations mingled with poison and blood. He will suddenly kill the enemy,” thus, and so forth. “One should sacrifice with the hawk sacrifice when performing abhicāra.” Cases like this are in fact adharmic, because, like violence and so forth, vaśīkaraṇa also is prohibited in various places. And likewise—“The violence of herbs, prostituting one’s wife, ritual murder, and using roots for magic.” Thus, by Manu, vaśīkaraṇa is included with those things that cause one to fall [from caste].

1473 
with Śākta commitments, against the even more extreme disavowals attributed to an even more 
stringently orthoprax imagined opponent, our author seeks out something of a middle path, 
allowing for the use of the technical materials found in these texts provided that their doctrinal 
elements are discarded. 
PP2: Thus, in regard to ritual installation (pratiṣṭhā) as well, only the procedure stated in the Purāṇas and so forth is to be accepted, not anything else. Because they [the Purāṇas] alone are accepted in the Bhaviṣyat Purāṇa as being authorities regarding “mixed dharmas.” 
And thus, in the Bhaviṣyat Purāṇa—“The Eighteen Purāṇas, and likewise the story of Rāma, the Viṣṇudharmaśāstra and so forth, and the Śivadharmas, O Bhārata, the Kārṣṇa, which is the fifth Veda, which is known to be the Mahābhārata, the Sauras, O best of kings of dharma, those stated by the Mānava, O lord of the earth, men say that victory is the name of these ones. . . .1325 
PP: But also, in the Devī Purāṇa [it is said:] 
The one who is the knower of the Vāma and Dakṣiṇa paths, who has gone to the far shore of the knowledge of the mothers, would be the best of ritual installers (sthāpaka) of the goddesses and with regard to the mothers. He is skilled in the meaning of the Pañcarātra. He is skilled in the system of the mothers. He possesses the house of Viṣṇu. He is always praised as a brahmacārin and giver of pacification. He is a knower of the śivadharma [śivaśāsana]. The one who knows the purpose of the gaṇas, the mothers and the grahas, being a householder or chaste student, is renowned as a ritual installer. . . . 
PP1: This is also not an indication that the practice [of this system] is that of the “outsider” Āgamas, [which are condemned]. 
PP2: [However this is to be rejected], because its practice is forbidden in the Matsya Purāṇa. As it is said in the Matsya Purāṇa: 
“O twice-borns, listen to the characterization in its entirety of the sthāpaka. He is skilled in the mantras of the Vedas, endowed with all of the limbs. He is a knower of the Purāṇas and is a knower of dharma. He is devoid of arrogance and greed. He arises in the country where the black deer goes about. He has an auspicious form; he is always

intent on the conduct of purity. He is not in contact with the lineages of the heretics”. . . . 1326 
A: Nor is it to be said that an installer of images who works with supplementary materials derived from the Tantras that constitute his own dharma—for example, ritual installation—has knowledge of [such] Vāma and Dakṣiṇa transmissions [i.e., a special capacity as sthāpaka] strictly on the basis of having taken initiations stated in those [Tantras]. 
Because, this [idea] is not accepted in the Smṛtis and other śāstras—because, it is not established that it is the Vāma and Dakṣiṇa transmissions as stated that delimit one’s being an installer and so forth. Because, given that upon one’s own examinations, the Left and Right transmissions, preceded by the demonstration of their own exegesis, have their doctrines supplemented in a dependent manner with the supplementary materials of [knowledge derived from] various vidyāsthānas, and therefore, the Left and Right transmissions merely convey supplementary assistance from one’s own Pratiṣṭhā Tantra by [offering] purely easeful and complete instruction.”1327 
In this section, the Aparārka introduces two distinctive pūrvapakṣins. The first of 
these insists that when establishing a structure or installing an image, only Purāṇic authorities 
can be consulted, for these are the sole resources prescribed for engaging with the so-called 
“mixed dharmas,” mostly pertaining to quotidian human needs and desires. At the same time, 
this stance prescribes that the ritualist who is to conduct the installation must be a-twice-born 
learned in the Veda and Purāṇas who was born in Āryavārta and has had no contact with 
heretics and their doctrines. For a Deccani king seeking the support of local Brāhmaṇa 
authorities who resides in the Koṅkaṇa, it is easy to see why such a definition would have

proven too stringent and narrow. Living in the Śaiva Age, complete non-contact with the 
heretics—in other words with the ideological and theological systems in evidence in most 
courts, was basically non-tenable for anyone who ever left their agrahāra. Even more 
importantly, for someone based in the twelfth-century Deccan, the Matsya Purāṇa’s emphatic 
insistence that the only person who can oversee construction sites and install images is 
someone born in what was by now a narrow belt in north India increasingly under the control 
of “foreign invaders” was highly impractical. Such a standard not only would have entailed 
that the overseers for all temple building and construction projects would have been culturally 
and linguistically distinct from the crews they deployed, which in practical terms would have 
been a disaster, but it excluded from consideration any of the Brāhmaṇa communities residing 
in the king’s own domain, the very people who would have represented the most logical allies 
for his Brāhmaṇizing project. 
It is the second opponent’s stance, invoking the Devī Purāṇa, however, that proves 
most relevant to our own interests, for what it asserts is that the ideal sthāpaka is none other 
than a Śākta Kaula following the Vāma path or Bhairavasiddhāntin adhering to the Dakṣiṇa 
transmission. This is to say, in the context of the medieval Deccan, that the sorts of authorities 
that the sthāpaka should consult are texts like the Piṅgalāmata and the type of person who 
should be in charge of installing images in the first place must belong to the very same 
demographics as the kārukas and their skull carrying Kālamukhas guru overseers. Moreover, 
the text makes plain that such a person has mastered the Śivadharmaśāstra and is employed to 
perform the Śāntyadhyāya to pacify bad circumstances and malignant entities. In his terse 
prose commentary, immediately following this quote, the imagined opponent sets out to 
establish that far from representing an outsider (bāhya) order of values, the Devī Purāṇa is 
1476 
perpetuating “mainstream” values, and in a certain sense, as we have seen throughout our own 
investigations, he is basically correct. 
Aparārka begins by acknowledging what to him must have seemed a sad state of 
affairs, namely, that it is logistically impractical to dispense with a methodology that 
thoroughly dominates the existing market. In other words, unlike Ballālasena, he is unwilling 
to simply declare that the Devī Purāṇa, which transparently advocates for the Śākta Tantras as 
pramāṇas, and its ilk are fraudulent sources that solely transmit delusion. How he seeks to 
circumvent this dynamic, which seemingly entirely undercuts his claims that the acquisition of 
Śaiva knowledge, like looking at the clouds in the sky and comparing them to different objects 
or animals, serves no concrete human end, is by asserting that the all of the actionable 
knowledge found in the texts of Vāma and Dakṣiṇa transmissions does not originate in these 
transmissions themselves nor is it causally conditioned by their doctrinal or theological tenets. 
Instead, he claims, everything of value in these texts actually is derived from the Brāhmaṇical 
traditions of the vidyāsthānas. Accessing this knowledge through the medium of Śākta Tantras 
is merely a matter of convenience for the users, since these sources offer particularly detailed 
and well-organized discussions of the relevant source knowledge. As we saw repeatedly in 
chapter 6, such a perspective of course is entirely in conflict with the emic understanding of 
the Śākta sthāpakas themselves, for they believed the capacity to craft and enliven images and 
empower structures that are so integral to temple design and construction emerge directly and 
organically from an esoteric awakening. When the craftsmen receives the transmission from 
their teacher, or a teacher from their own guru, as a byproduct of śaktipāta, there emerges a 
new capacity to align with, transfer, and manipulate different registers of energy, śakti. By 
adopting the bhāvas of the different gods as they work, the craftsman becomes able to replicate 
1477their presence in permanent form within animate objects and spaces. In short, 
professionalization in this model is fundamentally dependent on the ability to cultivate at will 
the states of altered of consciousness or experiences of possession that are defining features of 
Kaula discourse and are most certainly not a regular part of the repertoire of classical 
vidyāsthāna pedagogy. 
By attending to the interpretive choices that were made by Aparājita I’s near 
contemporary, Lakṣmīdhara, in the relevant portions of his own Kṛtyakalpataru, we get a much 
clearer sense of the eccentric nature of Aparārka’s compromise position even within the 
“Brāhmaṇical” discourse of the day.1328 Lakṣmīdhara invokes nearly exactly the same 
corpus1329 as Aparārka, namely, the Narasiṃha Purāṇa, Matsya Purāṇa, Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, and 
Devī Purāṇa. But in contrast to his counterpart, who, as we have seen, while not rejecting the 
text outright is noticeably embarrassed by much of what it advocates, for Lakṣmīdhara, it is 
the Devī Purāṇa that provides the most important conceptual resources that he will use in 
structuring his treatment of pratiṣṭhā. In fact, when it comes time to define the characteristics 
of the sthāpaka, the Kṛtyakalpataru embraces the very same passage that had caused 
Aparāditya I such consternation. Not only does Lakṣmīdhara cite from the text, offering a much 
more extended version of the passage that does much to clarify its actual intent, but the very 
passage in question actually supplies the guidelines he will use throughout his treatise in 
determining just how one should approach the consecration of the different types of deities. 
L: Now the installers (sthāpaka): 
It is said in the Devī Purāṇa: 
1328K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar, ed., Kṛtyakalpataru, Vol. IX: Pratiṣṭhākāṇḍa (Baroda: Oriental Institute, 1979). 1329Lakṣmīdhara’s text is of course considerably longer than Aparārka’s and devotes much more attention to the topic at hand. Thus, it is unsurprising that he supplements this shared canon with a small number of citations from additional sources, namely, the Vāmana, Varāha, and Āditya Purāṇas, most of which are invoked primarily in the extended discussion of alternative procedures for installing different forms of Vaiṣṇava deities. 
1478 
“Brahmā spoke: In the Śaiva system, within the Siddhānta of Śiva belonging to Śiva, the entrance [into the work of installation] is to be done. Whether a householder or a brahmacārin, the installer (sthāpaka) serves the cause of liberation. The one who is a knower of the Vāma and the Dakṣiṇa who has gone to the far shore of the knowledge of the mothers would be the best installer of the goddesses and even of the Mother. The one who is skilled in the meaning of the Pañcarātra, the one who knows the nature of the mothers, [installs] on behalf of Viṣṇu. He is a knower of the mantras, a householder, and a brahmacārin who keeps the fires. The one who is a knower of the śivadharma, who knows the purpose of the gaṇas and the mothers of the house, the one who knows the meaning of the solar deity system, is an installer of Sūrya, who bestows auspiciousness. 
The twice-born ṛtvij Brāhmaṇs who knows the nature of the meaning of the Veda and the Veda, and with regard to the other [deities], the installers who are knowers of their own śāstras who do auspicious worship: [all these are acceptable]. The Śaivas who are householders and best of twice-borns [can do installation] with regard to all [ritual systems]. And the ones are authorized who know the meanings of the mantras and the installation [procedures for] all of them.”1330 
In its extended form, at least as it is available to Lakṣmīdhara, the Devī Purāṇa seems 
to be teaching a model of professional eligibility akin to legal pluralism, with the added caveat 
that certain Śaivas seem to have a much broader band of expertise. Simply put, the ritual 
installation for different deities aligns with diverse standards and these govern who can 
perform the installation as well as the contents of the rituals themselves. 
1330Lakṣmīdhara seems to have a number of different, often inferior readings compared to Aparārka, as in jāpaka for the more logical sthāpaka. Note especially the replacement of “mātṛtantra,” likely referring to a specific class of Somasiddhānta-aligned pratiṣṭhā texts exemplified by the surviving Mātṛsadbhāva, with the vacuous “māṭrtattvaviśārada.” Nevertheless, it is preferable to go with the version of the text that Lakṣmīdhara himself would have read from. Perhaps, in the north, there was no knowledge of the Mātṛ Tantras by the twelfth century. Lakṣmīdhara, Kṛtyakalpataru, Pratiṣṭhākāṇḍa, pg. 66–67: atha sthāpakāḥ / tatra devīpurāṇe / brahmovāca / śivasya śivasiddhānte śaive kāryā niveśanā / gṛhī vā brahmacārī vā muktihetoḥ pratiṣṭhakaḥ / vāmadakṣiṇavettā yo mātṛvedārthapāragaḥ / sa bhave[t sth]āpakaḥ śreṣṭho devīnāṃ mātur eva ca / pāñcarātrārthakuśalo mātṛtattvaviśāradaḥ / viṣṇor gṛhī mantravettā brahmacārī ca sāgnikaḥ / śivaśāsanavettā yo gṛhamātṛgaṇārthavit / saurārthavedakaḥ sūryasthāpakas tu śubhapradaḥ / vedavedārthatattvajñā brāhmaṇā ṛtvijo dvijāḥ / anyeṣu ca svaśāstrajñāḥ sthāpakāḥ pūjakāḥ śubhāḥ / śaivāḥ sarveṣu kurvanti ye gṛhasthā dvijottamāḥ / sarvasthāpanamantrārthavedakāś cādhikāriṇaḥ / 
1479 
The text continues, offering additional specifications for esoteric Śākta systems, before 
concluding by specifying what types of social agents are not eligible for performing pratiṣṭhā 
and serving as sthāpakas. 
Now in regard to the Guruvetāla Tantra and in the Bhūta Tantras in the Dakṣiṇa system, in regard to the Kālikā in the Vāma Tantras the one who knows [the installation in all those systems] is a conveyor of noble auspiciousness. . . . Having known the form [image] that is [for] the installation of the goddesses—[that is the] entry way into the work [of ritual installation]. There would be twelve forms of Viṣṇu, of the one enjoined of [that] path and so forth. Having known the procedure for the door station deity, that installation would be auspicious. Otherwise, he would bring about an agitated quarrel, death, and great terror. 
In [the context of] the kingdom, in regard to a yajamāna, a king, or installer who is without the Āgama, those contrary entrants [into the work of pratiṣṭhā] will be cooked in the Avici hell and so forth [and likewise] those Brāhmaṇa sthāpakas who are devoid of the procedures (vidhi) belonging to Viṣṇu or Śiva. . . . O Indra, otherwise, the fashioning that is done using a common procedure will bestow terror. In general, the pūjā and the entry into the system (niveśanā) are different according to different doctrines.1331 
While the Devī Purāṇa seems intent on suggesting, albeit somewhat subtly, that Śākta 
initiates into the right- and left-hand transmissions and their various subdivisions really make 
the best sort of sthāpakas, especially when dealing with esoteric pantheons, the main rhetorical 
focus here is really on what sort of sthāpakas and patrons need to be avoided at all costs. These, 
we learn, are those who are devoid of mastery of the Āgamas, seemingly whichever one would 
be most appropriate in a given situation, as well as the “Brāhmaṇa sthāpakas” who do not even

procedure regardless of the deity being installed. Such people, we learn cook in the Avici Hell, 
and their actions bring calamity to those around them. 
Now that he has provided a whole range of options for different types of sthāpakas as 
befit different purposes, Lakṣmīdhara next turns to the question of who exactly has adhikāra 
for performing ritual installations. Again, it is the Devī Purāṇa that provides him with his 
answers. L: Now, the ones who are eligible. The Devī Purāṇa says: 
The gods should be installed according to the division of varṇa and āśrama and not otherwise. Brahmā is to be installed by Brāhmaṇas, he being auspicious and accompanied by the Gāyatrīs. Now, Viṣṇu is established by the four varṇas, having been caused to be installed by the ones desiring happiness. But Bhairava, however, [is installed] by the four varṇas and by the untouchables, according to their doctrines.1332 All the people install the Mothers who are the best of the gods. 
Having caused a liṅga to be installed, a householder or even an ascetic should worship it always. Śiva being installed bestows health, a kingdom, and likewise, a son. However, a Lord of Yoga (yogeśa) who is endowed with yoga should be installed by those who know yoga. Otherwise, a loud substantial commotion will arise in the city.1333 
In comparison to what we saw prescribed in the Piṅgalāmata, in a certain sense, the 
Devī Purāṇa is here advocating a socially “conservative” position within which only specific 
agents can engage in particular activities in a manner conditioned by caste identity, and within 
which there are potentially dire consequences for transgressing such norms. What is 
conspicuously absent from such a disciplinary order, however, is any effort at creating a 
systematic privileging of the authority of Brāhmaṇas. Instead, the ordering principle here is 
1332One might also more literally translate this phrase as “according to the doctrine of the untouchables,” but I have as of yet seen minimal contiguous textual evidence that would support this reading. 1333Lakṣmīdhara, Kṛtyakalpataru, Pratiṣṭhākāṇḍa, pg. 68: athā’dhikāriṇaḥ / devīpurāṇe— varṇāśramavibhedena devāḥ sthāpyā tu nānyathā / brahmā ca brāhmaṇaiḥ sthāpyo gāyatrīsahitaḥ śubhaḥ / caturvarṇaiḥ sthito viṣṇuḥ pratiṣṭhāpyaḥ sukhārthibhiḥ / bhairavas tu caturvarṇair antyajānāṃ tathā mataḥ / mātaraḥ sarvalokās tu sthāpayanti surottamāḥ / liṅgaṃ gṛhī yatī vā’pi saṃsthāpya pūjayet sadā / āyur rājyaṃ tathā putraṃ dadāti sthāpito haraḥ / kiṃtu yogārthibhiḥ sthāpyo yogeśo yogasaṃyutaḥ / anyathā kalahodvegaḥ pure saṃjāyate bhṛśam /

that pantheons and their associated regimes are essentially community-specific. While 
Brāhmaṇas have exclusive sovereignty over the installation of the images of the god Brahmā, 
they possess this right for precisely the same reason that professional yogins are given a 
monopoly over the installation of “yogic deities,” a logic of sympathetic magic in which like 
aligns with like. 
Before setting these materials aside and returning to our account of how Hemādri 
remade this world, we might also make note that the religious landscape that the Devī Purāṇa 
formulates and that Lakṣmīdhara proceeds to formalize draws a fascinating and somewhat 
expected distinction between two kinds of social inclusivism in the domain of religion, one 
that should render plain that even in regard to the early medieval world, histories of caste are 
often entirely different and distinct from histories of untouchability. As the Devī Purāṇa 
understands things, Vaiṣṇava traditions acknowledge the adhikāra of “all four varṇas”—in 
other words Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas, as well as Śūdras—to act as religious authorities, 
at least in the domain of installing images. This is substantive inclusivism that does indeed go 
beyond typical post Vedic-era Vaidika visions of who is eligible to act in the religious domain. 
As such, it would be easy to overlook that such a system deliberately skips over any mention 
of the people we now call Dalits, were it not for the fact that the Devī Purāṇa deliberately 
juxtaposes this delimited inclusivism with the ethos of the Bhairava tantras, which, from an 
etic perspective explicitly treats people from an antyajāti background as religious authorities. 
It is only in some of the Śākta sources, building upon the archaic Atimārgic legacy of the 
Śivadharmaśāstra where, at least in some domains, allusions to caste simply fall away. One 
order of preferentiality is then replaced by a different hierarchical order. This founded, in 
theory, on initiations and esoteric attainment, but in practice quite likely was powered by 
1482 
networked social connections that linked people from disparate backgrounds on the basis of 
shared commensality in a ritual setting. 
As we have seen in the Piṅgalāmata and the inscriptional record, in the world of the 
late medieval Deccan, one of the primary occasions for experiencing such ritual commensality 
was precisely the festivities surrounding acts of pratiṣṭhā as well as the subsequent annual 
celebration of such occasions. This was when kings, warrior chieftains, the local big man, or 
other analogous political authorities, drawn from a range of castes, the religious professionals 
responsible for the management of sacred domains falling outside of the purview of the state, 
by this period largely Kālamukhas, also from a range of castes, acting as the primary 
transmitters of the Śākta Tantras and Bhairava Siddhānta, and the ostensibly Śūdra or Dalit 
professional artisan and artist builder and performance classes who made the lived reality and 
composed the soundtrack that ordered much of lived experience, came together and shared 
space and affective emotional experiences while supping on the transgressive witches brew 
that marked them as brothers. As we have seen throughout this study, it was these moments 
and these spaces that formed key bonds that ordered an otherwise almost overwhelmingly 
pluralistic world whose differentiated domains rendered much of influence and social capital 
site and praxis specific. Instituting a new world organized around different values would 
necessarily therefore demand disrupting this existing order and undercutting the mode of social 
relations that it fostered. 
At Kukkunur, in the courtyard that stands before the Navaliṅgeśvara temple, the stone 
themselves speak of such continuities. There, on single sheet of stone, in varied hands spanning 
two centuries, five inscriptions from the Cāḷukyas, the Kālachuris, and the Seuṇa Yādavas 
express their intentions to protect the long established siddhapīṭha in accordance with “its own 
1483 
dharma” (ī dharmmamaṃ svadharmmadiṃ sāsirvvaru pratipāḷisuvaru).1334 The chief focus of 
each of these records is an affirmation of and investment in the oldest site at Kukkunur, 
corresponding to the original place of its founding (mūlasthāna). A few kilometers away from 
the Jyeṣṭhā temple, we find the site is marked by a now heavily renovated Rāṣṭrakūṭa structure, 
somewhat older even than Navaliṅgeśvara, that is dedicated to Śiva.1335 
As the locals do today, other inscriptions refer to this space as Kaḷēśvara, and in the 
tenth and eleventh centuries, the temple is represented as part of a compound incorporating the 
monastic headquarters that housed “the lineage of the āvaḷis.” These are of course the very 
same Kālamukha preceptors whose most illustrious representative, the siddha Kaḷēśvara, 
master of vast canon of Śaiva and Śākta knowledge, guru to sculptors, gold smiths and artisans, 
and caretaker of the triadic pantheon of Kālī, Jyeṣṭhā/Siddhayogeśvarī, and the Picumata 
Brahmayāmala’s Bhairava, had occupied so much of our attention in chapter 4. 
1334All the inscriptions consulted and summarized here are from a small volume called Śāsana Paricaya published by P. B. Desai. Despite its innocuous title, this volume gathers together all of the inscriptions discovered as of 1956, from Kukkunur, arranging them in chronological order. Pandurang Bhimarao Desai, Śāsana Paricaya: Idaralli Graṃthakāranu Sanṃgrahisi Pariśōdhisida 53 Śāsanagaḷannu avugaḷa Sārāṃśa, Pīṭhikĕ Muṃtādudaroṃdigĕ Saṃpādisidĕ (Dharwar: Karnataka Itihasa Samsodhaka Mandala, 1956). 1335Most of the texts in question are extremely fragmentary. Our focus here will be on a set of inscriptions that appear on a single stela (no. 47) recording individual donations offered on different dates across multiple generations.

Kaḷlēśvara temple, Kukkunur as it appeared before the recent renovations. Published in Gerard Foekema, The Cāḷukya Architecture. Vol II. p. 642.1336 
For this reason it is hardly surprising that in the documentary portions of the śāsanas under 
discussion, the bulk of which were produced during the floruit of Kaḷēśvara’s predecessors and 
successors, alongside consistently offering homage to these sacerdotal authorities, 
acknowledged with varying degrees of intimacy as gurudēvaru, svāmigaḷu, and pūjāri, we find 
evidence of financial support to the Brāhmaṇas at the local brahmapurī, variously 
characterized either as Ṛg Vedic or (somewhat implausibly given the register of expression in 
evidence) those who have crossed over the farthest shore of the four Vedas 
(cartvēdapāragarappa [sic]), but also of oja/ojja artisans, garland makers, and makers of song 
(hāḍuvargam), and of ascetics, possibly committed to the worship of Khaṇḍobā/Mailāri, 
engaged in austerities (ekkōṭi tapōdhanaru). Though each of these texts is pretty terse, there is

considerable consistency across the corpus not only in the sort of social agents and institutions 
to whom the donations are addressed, but even in the circumstances under which the 
endowments are being made. 
The maṇḍapa that abuts the front of the Kaḷēśvara temple at Kukkunur. The now heavily whitewashed images on top seem to be older than the interior, which has many Vijayanagar period modifications. 
Four of the five donations were made during solar, lunar, or combined eclipses, with two of 
them being made during eclipses during the new moon (amāvāsya) typically one of the least 
auspicious days of the Indian calendar.1337 All five of the inscriptions, it almost goes with 
saying, understand Kukkunur as an undying land-grant, to be managed in perpetuity by the 
overseers of its temple complexes, figures who explicitly and implicitly are recognized as 
having juridical authority over the management of the space and whose affairs fall outside the 
purview of state intervention. This dynamic, in fact, which simply takes the sacred autonomy

1486 
of the siddhakṣetra for granted, holds true throughout the entire inscriptional corpus without a 
single exception, independent of how aligned the donor is with the institutional values of the 
site. Thus, for example, a copper plate from 1183 CE issued by a Kalachuri ruler speaks of 
how: 
The King of Kings. . . renewed the endowment of the great divine field known of as Kukkunur, which is the domain of the mother of the world, the illustrious Goddess Jyeṣṭhā, which is contained within the 300 charter of Beluvala, having villages endowed in perpetuity with well-known limits, along with its gardens, stones, water, buried treasure, deposited wealth. . . . endowed with governing authority has mastery over the eight enjoyments. . . . It is endowed with [exclusive rights concerning] all the collections of substances, taxes, duties, customs, correctional authority, juridical authority. . . [jurisdiction over] artisans, garland vendors, and worshipping officiants, and is entitled in perpetuity not to be “pointed at” [repossessed] by the king.1338 
In a similar vein, less than a decade beforehand, the inscription dedicated to celebrating the 
siddha Kaḷēśvara concludes by rather emphatically declaiming: “To the one who protects the 
unperishing dharma, there will be a destruction of all sin. May it be so! [But,] for the person 
who even thinks about the ruin of this place, a complete destruction of their family line will 
ensue.”1339 
The very last inscription produced at Kukkunur during its heyday is scrawled on the 
bottom of a floor to ceiling stone plate that still stands in the courtyard before the 
Navaliṅgeśvara temple.1340 Rather significantly, it was issued in the twenty-first year of the

1487reign of Siṅghaṇadeva II, the Seuṇa Yādava king. It is unclear whether it was the king himself 
or one of his representatives who made the pilgrimage to Kukkunur to perform worship of the 
honorable feet of the ācārya of the gods. By this time, it seems, Kaḷēśvara, either deceased or 
retired, had been succeeded by a certain Virūpākṣasvāmi, and it was this authority that the 
Seuṇa power implored to perform rites directed at removal of “obstacles,” both sacred and 
secular. As part of the bargain, it almost goes without saying, the Seuṇa kingdom affirmed the 
sovereignty of Kukkunur and its Kālamukhas in perpetuity. The year was 1231 CE. Hardly 
anyone could have imagined that two decades later, the Śākta power center at the heart of 
Kukkunur would be wiped off the face of the earth let alone that this would take place under 
the explicit direction of the Seuṇa king’s own son. 
Throughout this study, Kukkunur has served as a touchstone of sorts for our various 
investigations as we have sought to excavate the various dimensions of the often-occluded life- 
world of the medieval Deccan and its institutions. It was Kukkunur that formed the bridge 
between our study of conventions of transactional Sanskrit textuality as a genre and its 
implications for making sense of the multilingual documentary records of the Deccan that 
enabled us to recover indications of shared approaches to institutionalization that linked 
together seemingly unrelated Śākta sacred centers like Bagali, Sirshangi, and Kukkunur itself. 
It was Kukkunur that offered us our case study of the professionalization process to which even 
the most gifted sacerdotal authority who sought to head up a lineage was subject, and that cued 
us in to some of the transactional dynamics by which the Atimārga Lākulas end up the primary

custodians and transmitters of the Bhairava Siddhānta and Śākta Tantras. Finally, as we turned 
our attention from the pratiṣṭhāpaṇācāryas who managed these places to the work crews 
compromised of artisan initiates acting their direction, it was Kukkunur that enabled us to 
recognize that the practices spoken of in works like the Piṅgalāmata, the Kālamukha ecumene 
of the Deccan, and the archaic artisan tradition of the worship of Caṇḍeśvara and Vāgeśvarī, 
elements of which continue to be reflected in the lived practices of the very same goldsmith 
communities that already in the eleventh century formed a core constituency served by these 
networks, all formed complementary parts of a single fascinating story. Thus, it is fitting, as 
our story comes to an end, that we turn once more to Kukkunur to witness first-hand how the 
Śaiva Age was deliberately destroyed. 
At Devagiri, in the assembly of the king, it was announced by the king Śrī Kṛṣṇa himself that Kukkunur [was to be made] a garbhagṛha for all the gods (sarvadevatāgarbhagṛham). He [the commander, Cauṇḍarāya], being commanded by the king “do it, for the sake of the flourishing of our kingdom,” had obtained the seal of the king for that purpose. 
Given that there was a transgression of dharma (dharmaprasaṅga), according to the statement “whoever owns the earth at which time owns the fruit,” the general welfare indicated that the great agrahāra of Kukkunur, which is the crest jewel of the fields of all the siddhas, had to be taken over [lit., released (mukta)]. In the seventh year of the reign of Śrī Kānharadeva, who is the wheel turner proud with splendor with the power of the arms of Nārāyaṇa of the Yādava clan, Kukkunur was made an agrahāra with fixed taxes (niyatakara), to be paid with gold dinar (niṣka). . . . 
Due to truth, the sun illuminates the world; the deities have arisen from truth. From truth, the earth bears fruit. In truth, everything is established. Thus, being addressed by them, Śrī Cauṇḍarāja, with supreme bhakti, preceeded by the washing of the feet, gave Kukkunur to those great Brāhmaṇas of various gotras along with showers of gold. 
Regarding the protection of this dharma, the fruit is the earth, which has been enjoyed by many kings beginning at creation. To whomever it belongs at a certain time, his is the fruit. . . . Whoever disregards [this] in action, thought, or speech will become a Caṇḍāla at that very moment, cast outside of all dharma. 
The seat of all dharmas, the breath of all embodied beings, the instruction of future kings: by him [Kandharāya], this order has been given. Let this be made free from 
1489 
deficiencies, with no defects, by those who are knowers of faults. May dharma be eternal, and embodied beings be happy.1341 
As we seen throughout this chapter, the Seuṇa Yādava King Siṅghaṇa II was at once 
the perpetuator of the old ethos of the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas and the promoter of newly emerging 
popular Śākta ecumene specific to Maharashtra. Rather unexpectedly, his death almost at once 
sparked a sea change in values. With the ascent to the throne of his son Kandharāya (c. 1247– 
1259/60), a new sort of centralized policies emanated from the Yādava royal court and down 
into the real world, leading to the rejection of an older order of values founded on a different 
vision of the comity between religion and law. In this copper plate issued in 1255 CE, a mere 
five years before the release of Hemādri’s Caturvargacintāmaṇi, an undying land-grant that 
for centuries had been under the direction of non-Brāhmaṇa Śākta-Śaiva religious authorities 
tending to a pantheon of potent and even somewhat terrible esoteric deities is summarily 
terminated and its custodians are evicted—or in the bitterly ironic idiom of the Dharmaśāstra, 
they are forcibly granted mukti.

taxes, much like we saw in the Marathi language inscription at Unkeshwar, the new Kukkunur 
is designated as a sacred center that is to house a pantheon comprised of “all the gods.” This is 
to say, the existing focuses of worship—Kālī, Jyeṣṭhā/Siddhayogeśvarī, and the Picumata 
Brahmayāmala’s Bhairava— are replaced by a decidedly non-popular and non-Tantric Vedic 
pantheon. In contradistinction with everything we have seen from our earlier sources, which 
addressed the merchant and artisan devotees of the Kālamukha gurus as the primary local 
authorities, oversight for their worship as well as all local affairs are placed in the hands of a 
collectivity of Brāhmaṇas. Indeed, instead of offering a hymn to a deity, such as the now ousted 
Jyeṣṭhā, the Kandharāya copper plate addresses its praises at tedious length precisely at these 
Brāhmaṇas themselves—all one thousand and two hundred of them. It is these gods on earth, 
four faced on account of their study of the four Vedas, singularly intent solely on sattvic 
things—and them alone—that the document sees as providing the source of sacral authority 
that makes Kukkunur great. And instead of being privileged for their great learning, the text 
celebrates our Brāhmaṇas primarily for their purity and their piety—in other words, for their 
conduct. The inscription concludes with emphatic affirmation of the necessity of protecting 
and enforcing dharma. It is dharma itself, and not the institution at Kukkunur, that is deemed 
eternal. 
Indeed, radically departing from the formulations as we find in the grants of the 
Cāḷukyas, Kalachuris, Hoysalas and prior Yādava kings, our text ascribes the locus of dharma 
not to some particularized samaya or svadharma that must be protected or to the authority of 
an enumerated samūha, but rather to the body of the king himself. It is Kandharāya, and by 
extension agents such as his chief minister and military commander (mahāpradhāna 
daṇḍanāyaka) Cauṇḍarāja, Hemādri’s immediate predecessor in the most powerful office in 
1491 
the land, that is “the seat of all dharmas, the respiration of all bodies, the instruction of future 
kings.” In place of site-specific pluralism, inflected by variations in time and context, now and 
forever, it is the state as embodied in the acting sovereign that is source of all legitimate 
authority and that sets the standard for what constitutes all acceptable human action. 
In the realm of geopolitics, the reign of King Kandharāya was marked militarily by a 
series of rebellions. For reasons that are unclear, and which may well have to do with the 
sudden rejection of longstanding norms in the realms of governance and religion, virtually all 
of the Seuṇa vassal powers residing in Karnataka, for example the Guttas, the Sindhas, and the 
Rattas, attempted to break away from Seuṇa oversight, and each of them was brutally 
suppressed. In contrast, on the home front, the period saw an unusual degree of comity among 
the Seuṇa aristocrats themselves. Rather than offing his siblings, a very common strategic 
approach in these circles for consolidating power, Kandharāya entrusted them with key duties 
in helping to manage the Seuṇa realm. Most importantly, he embraced his younger half- 
brother, Mahādeva, first appointing him as the prince in waiting and designated successor 
(yuvarāja) and then actually sharing the throne with him in the last years of his reign, a dynamic 
that in the inscriptional records leads to a repeated representation of Kandharāya and Mahādeva 
as a second Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa or even Yuddhiṣṭhira and Arjuna, in the kali age. Thus, 
already, during the lifetime of his predecessor, certainly by 1251 CE, when he is no younger 
yuvarāja, Mahādeva seems to have begun to assemble his own personal court of commanders 
and advisors with the express blessings of his brother the king. 
In the absence of the publication and comprehensive study of the complete Seuṇa 
Yādava documentary records as they have been uncovered by various Indian institutions, 
especially the ASI, we are not yet in a position to accurately reconstruct the officials that would 
1492 
have made up either of these Seuṇa cabinets, which is to say who were the exact people who 
would have stood witness in the assembly of the king at Devagiri while King Kandharāya 
announced that to ensure the stability of his realm, Kukkunur as it currently existed would have 
to be destroyed. There is little reason to doubt, however, that a young Hemādri, already 
working within the chancellery and the treasury and working hard on what would eventually 
become his Caturvargacintāmaṇi, would have been among them. And while access to such 
resources may well serve to clarify once and for all the direction in which such influence is 
flowing—in other words, whether Hemādri is simply entextualizing an newly emerging Seuṇa 
imperial ethos already in evidence in the early days of his professional life or whether, as his 
writings assert, he himself was a key architect of this conceptual project, one thing that is 
certain is that the considerable conceptual and rhetorical overlap between documents like our 
Kukkunur copper plates and the prescriptions of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi can hardly be an 
accident. In fact, as we are about to see, it is the Caturvargacintāmaṇi itself that provides the 
interpretive context for making sense of how seemingly incidental efforts at remedying 
individual “breaches in dharma” could usher in a new world order. 
As was alluded to at some length earlier in this chapter, the published edition of the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi leaves much to be desired, for it prints a text that is disordered and in 
many places very incomplete. As we do not, at least as of yet, possess a copy of the 
Mokṣakhaṇḍa, and the Tīrthakhaṇḍa of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi was unknown to its editors, 
in its current state the text as printed transitions from the division on dāna, a proper khaṇḍa, 
right to the Pariśeṣa, or supplementary portion. In Bharatacandra Siromani’s edition, this 
Pariśeṣa section begins with the two volumes containing the Śrāddhapaddhati and concludes 
with the astrological guidelines provided by the kālanirṇaya. One has only to read Hemādri’s 
1493 
own preface to the Śrāddhapaddhati, however, to recognize that the text itself presumes that 
the Śrāddhapaddhati was to have followed at least two additional topical divisions within the 
Pariśeṣa: And on that matter in the first [prakaraṇa of the Pariśeṣa], brilliant Hemādri who has 
an auspicious heart, speaks the śrāddha injunction joined with a praise of the result. 
There is stated in the beginning, during the installation pertaining to liṅgas and images and so forth, [the procedures] for worship of such deities as Śiva, Viṣṇu, Gaṇeśa, and so forth. Immediately after [in the text], during the section on the installation of the cows, there was stated the procedures for the ārādhana of Harihara and so forth, as well as the wish-fulfilling cows who are Nanda and so forth, [all of whom] have the form of deities. Now, regarding the installation of those having the forms of Brāhmaṇas and so forth. . . is stated the worship of deities who have the form of ancestors (pitṛ). . . .1342 
Thus far at least, the second, and potentially quite pertinent part of this paddhati, which 
would have told us in detail about what Hemādri envisioned regarding the worship of 
Harihara—Viṭṭhal at Pandharpur—as well as how Nanda and the other companions of Kṛṣṇa 
fit into this part of our story, has yet to surface. What we do have on hand, however, almost 
entirely intact, is the opening division of Hemādri’s unpublished and thus far undocumented 
Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, which we will read from the manuscript currently in the possession of the 
Royal Asiatic Society of Bombay. Here is how it begins: 
There was a king known of as Mahādeva who was the ornament of the Lineage of the Moon, of whom there was a multitude of gracious [lit., autumnal] qualities. . . . Of him there was a lord of all the śrīkaraṇas named Hemādri. . . . Of that lord of the Śrīkaraṇas, there was a paddhati pertaining to all the gods (sārvadaivikī), which was exceptionally clever in showing the path of the Śrauta and Smārta rituals. In that paddhati, this is the first śloka: 
Having approached the Pañcarātras, all the Purāṇas, and the entirety of the Śruti and Smṛti, and having “examined” the Āgamas, the Karmapaddhati is laid out for the benefit of sacrificers. 
1342Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Śrāddhakalpa, pg. 7–8: tatra cādye prakaraṇe sa hemādriḥ śubhāśayaḥ / phalapraśaṃsāsaṃyuktaṃ vakti śrāddhavidhiṃ sudhīḥ // uktam ādau liṅgapratimādyadhiṣṭhāne śivaviṣṇugaṇeśādidevatānām ārādhanam / anantaraṃ gavādhiṣṭhāne devatārūpāṇāṃ nandādikākāmadhenūnāṃ hariharādīnāṃ cārādhanam / athedānīṃ brāhmaṇādirūpādhiṣṭhāne. . . . pitṛrūpāṇāṃ devatānām ārādhanam ucyate/ 
1494 
By Hemādri is stated the dyadic iṣṭāpūrta, which are the sanātana dharmas of all twice- borns, conveying the rituals of the Śrauta and Smārtas [and] who [abide by the] sadācāra.1343 
Eerily foreshadowing the idiom of early colonial and modern Hindu apologetics, 
Hemādri states that the purpose of the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati is to teach one dimension of the 
sanātana dharmas to his preferred demographic, namely, all twice-borns of unimpeachable 
conduct. On the surface, the religious modality he is promoting is made up of a two-part 
synthesis of Śrauta—or “Vaidika”—and Smārta elements, with the latter term in this context 
referring to a heady brew of Dharmaśāstra, Purāṇa, and repurposed extracts from both the 
Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava traditions of the Mantramārga. In actuality, however, in the sources we 
will be examining, the Śrauta contribution is mostly confined to some mantras and the 
liturgical use of Vedic hymns, often in strikingly new ritual settings, as well as to the rhetoric 
of Brāhmaṇical normativity. Almost all Hemādri’s key conceptual resources are drawn from 
an expanding canon of Smārta religious resources, which have themselves been extracted from 
rather disparate points of origin. We might notice as well that in Hemādri’s formulation, “the 
Āgamas” are set apart rhetorically and syntactically from the other elements, even being 
governed by a different verb (instead of being “attained” (samāsādya), they are “examined” 
(nirīkṣya)), a state of affairs in alignment with the subordinate incorporation of this discourse 
that will be on display throughout our text. While many of these elements are themselves 
hardly new, when the Caturvargacintāmaṇi was composed, one could have found precious 
1343Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, fol. 1 recto – 1 verso: asti śarataguṇastomasoma- vaṃśavibhūṣaṇam / mahādeva iti khyāto rāj[a]rājeva bhūtale // 4 // tasyāsti nāma hemādriḥ sarvaśrīkaraṇaprabhuḥ / nijodārata[y]ā yaś ca sarve śrīḥ karaṇaḥ prabhuḥ // 5 // tasya śrīkaraṇeśasya paddhatiḥ sārvadaivikī / śrautasmārtakriyāmārgapradarśanapaṭīyasī // 6 // tasyām ayam ādyaślokaḥ / pañcarātrāṇi sarvāṇi purāṇāni ca kṛṭsnaśaḥ / śrutismṛti[ṃ] samāsādya vāgamān karmapaddhatiḥ // 7 // nirīkṣya yāya[jūk]ānāṃ saukaryāya prapañcyate / hemādriṇā sadācāraśrautasmārtakriyā’va[hau] // iṣṭāpūrtau dvijātīnāṃ dharmau prokt[au] sanātanau // 8 // 
1495 
few precedents that were more than a century or two old for treating these practices and values 
as forming complementary parts of single system, or for labelling that system “Smārta,” let 
alone for proclaiming, as Hemādri is about to do, that this Smārta canon serves superior 
religious ends than Śrauta knowledge and praxis. In other words, our author is seeking to 
identify as constitutive of what is orthoprax and orthodox a body of knowledge that in fact, 
among learned Brāhmaṇas, has only just barely begun to pass into the realm of social 
acceptability. 
As is often the case, before moving onto the Hemādri’s use of the term iṣṭāpūrta as 
comprising the union of Śrauta and Smārta dharmas, with the Smārta elements taking 
conceptual as well as rhetorical priority over the Śrauta, it is instructive to look to 
Lakṣmīdhara’s Kṛtyakalptaru as a rhetorical foil. Lakṣmīdhara raises the matter of iṣṭāpūrta in 
an extremely brief manner towards the beginning of his Brahmacārikāṇḍa,1344 in the context 
of the wider consideration of the different dimensions of varṇāśramadharma that opens his 
nibandha. Citing the Kālikā Purāṇa, we are told that iṣṭāpūrta is a dvandva compound made 
up of the Smṛta (and not Smārta) and Śrauta dharmas as accepted by the śiṣṭas (śiṣṭasammata). 
Iṣṭa is comprised of yajña and so forth, while pūrta is made up of things like pratiṣṭhā, a term 
Lakṣmīdhara helpfully clarifies he understands as referring to the installation of the gods 
through methods such as jalāśayotsarga and so forth (devatāpratiṣṭhājalāśayotsargādi). 
Iṣṭāpūrta, the text tells us, bestows both enjoyment and liberation (bhuktimukti), though it is 
1344Lakṣmīdhara, Kṛtyakalpataru, Brahmacārikāṇḍa, pg. 8: kālikāpurāṇe— iṣṭāpūrtau smṛtau dharmau śrutau vai śiṣṭasaṃmatau / pratiṣṭhādyaṃ tayoḥ pūrtaṃ iṣṭaṃ yajñādilakṣaṇam / bhuktimuktipradaṃ pūrtaṃ iṣṭaṃ bhogārthasādhanam / L: pratiṣṭhādyam devatāpratiṣṭhājalāśayotsargādi / tayoḥ [iṣṭāpūrtayoḥ madhye] / It is interesting to note that Lakṣmīdhara’s short treatment of iṣṭāpūrta, which Hemādri reworks in his Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, is followed almost immediately thereafter by Lakṣmīdhara’s terse treatment of the sādhāraṇa dharmas, which, as we shall see in the next chapter, Hemādri reworks in his Vratakhaṇḍa. In both instances, a minor element in the Kṛtyakalpataru is reimagined as the central organizing principle of a new discourse into which is invested a new and unprecedented significance. 
1496 
somewhat unclear whether these two outcomes are native to both domains, or if the pūrta gives 
“worldly enjoyment” while the iṣṭa results in heaven. Lakṣmīdhara next introduces his last 
proof text on this subject, drawn from the Mahābhārata, which seeks to further clarify the 
practices we should group under the two terms. Iṣṭa, we learn, entails the observance of the 
agnihotra, the keeping of the fires within the homes, and dāna. Pūrta, in contrast, is comprised 
of setting up wells, step wells, and tanks, the building of temples to the gods, the giving of 
food, as well as the making of gardens. Rather than representing the foundational elements that 
make up “pure” Brāhmaṇical observances, the purpose of these passages in situ is merely 
establish in passing that these practices are accepted—and acceptable—among twice-borns. 
Just as importantly, no attempt is made by our commentator or by his sources to align these 
two elements with specific canons of textual authorities, and this is in spite of the fact that the 
Kṛtyakalpataru, for the first time in Dharmaśāstra history, makes liberal use of Purāṇic textual 
resources. Lakṣmīdhara’s real objective here, as is made clear by the following citations from 
Manu and several other dharma works, help clarify the relationship between 
Varṇāśramadharma as a system in the abstract and the specific dharmas allotted to particular 
varṇa subsets, a topic that occupies him for quite a bit of time. With this in mind, we can return 
to considering how Hemādri will make use of the very same sorts of raw materials. 
H: Among those two, the iṣṭa bestows the fruit of heaven and the pūrta is known to bestow mokṣa. The iṣṭa is defined to be the agnihotra, austerity, truth, and the recitation of all the Vedas, the honoring of guests and the viśvadeva sacrifice. Wells, step wells, tanks and so forth, and the temples of the gods, bestowing food, and sweet [speech] are called pūrta. [Thus it is said:] 
“One who makes eastern gardens or reservoirs, and likewise, one who makes trees grow, one who bestows women, builds bridges—he obtains heaven, there is no doubt. Of whom there are tanks and so forth, and reservoirs resplendent with wells, and gardens, and shelters, the bestowing of food and who has lovely speech, there is wealth and the higher world. Those dedicated to building bridges and those dedicated to purifying tīrthas, the makers of the wells and step wells, are released from the great 
1497danger, and one who performs the improvement (saṃskāra) in the step wells, the gardens, and the tanks, and in the temples obtains the fruit belonging to original founders [of a settlement].” 1345 
The first thing that should be obvious here is that there is a gaping theological divide 
between the ideas espoused by Hemādri in his prose preface and his chosen proof texts.1346 In 
the prose, the Caturvargacintāmaṇi seeks to align the pūrta practices of making “wells, step 
wells, tanks and so forth, and the temples of the gods, and funding (people/endowments)”— 
what it defines as the Smārta dharmas—with the obtaining of the higher order goal of liberation 
(mokṣa). There is imagined to be a contrast here with iṣṭa practices of Śrauta religion, which 
at best merely lead to a temporary rebirth in one of the heavens. The problem here is that as 
Hemādri’s very first proof text itself proclaims, “he obtains heaven, there is no doubt” 
(svargam āpnoty asaṃśayaḥ). In other words, his sources themselves draw no such distinction, 
for they treat the pūrta practices as simply, at best, another way to win heaven (svarga) or the 
other world (paraṃ lokaṃ) and in fact mostly commonly align them with the gratification of 
mundane human desires. 
If we want then to understand why Hemādri has chosen to foreground these precise 
proof texts, despite the fact that they explicitly undercut one of his major assertions, we have 
to look at the other rhetorical features evident in these particular passages that are hardly 
ubiquitous in this sort of discourse. And what we find, not merely in the verses we have just 
examined, but also in the remainder of the text that has not been provided up to here, is an 
1345Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, fol. 1 verso – 2 recto: tatreṣṭaḥ svargapaladaḥ pūrto mokṣapradaḥ smṛtaḥ // agnihotraṃ tapaḥ satyaṃ vedānāṃ c[a] p[a]r[āy]aṇaṃ / ātithyaṃ vaiśvadevaś ca iṣṭam ity abhidhīyate // vāpikūpataḍākādi devatāyatanāni ca / ann[a]pradāna[ṃ] m[adhurā] pūrtam ity abhidhīyate // pūr[v]ārām[a]prapākārī tathā vṛkṣādhiropakaḥ / kanyāpradaḥ setukārī svargam āpnoty asaṃśayaḥ // yeṣāṃ taḍāgādiśubhāḥ prapāś ca ārāmakūpāś ca pratiśrayāś ca / annapradānaṃ madhurā ca vāṇ[ī], teṣām arthaś caiva paraś ca lokaḥ // setubandhar[atā] ye ca tīrthaśaucaratāś ca ye / taḍāgakūpakartāro mucyante mahābhayāt / kūpārāmataḍāgeṣu devatāyataneṣu ca / punaḥ saṃskārakartā ca labhate maulikaṃ phalaṃ / 1346This is particularly evident when one looks at this Purāṇic passage in situ, but given that we have executed this exercise so many times, extraneous substantiation here seems unnecessary. 
1498 
atypical emphasis on “purifying” or “renovating” existing material culture, whether we are 
talking about water sources or ritual centers, as producing the same exact karmic benefits as 
building something new, a stance that travels together with the conspicuous absence of the 
usual invocation that the protection and preservation of existing endowments and structures on 
their own terms by political and religious actors is the highest form of dharma. In other words, 
these proof texts offer sanction for a massive project to refurbish “public works” in a manner 
that brings existing institutions into closer alignment with the best practices and values of the 
people doing the “renovation.” Such an aim, which invokes that it is better to do things 
according to the right set of rules, provides a logical bridge to the next major focus in the 
paddhati, which seeks to align material institutional renewal with the instituting of new rule 
governed norms: 
A man becomes devoid of greed by not being intoxicated/impassioned and by means of proper rules. Having given to twice-borns by whom the Veda is caused to flourish [lit., who are made venerable by the Vedas], he is released from sin. The one whose food, given with a pleased mind, is consumed by hundreds and hundreds of Brāhmaṇas does not become an animal. By the giving of food, a man does not follow a bad course. Therefore, food is to be given in a manner that does not violate the rules. . . . 
H: Thus, by informing about the pūrta, he continues to relate the installation (pratiṣṭhā) of the god in context.1347 
Essentially what Hemādri is doing here is proposing that the procedures for establishing 
institutions are dependent on a new and necessary context. This context has as its constant 
point of reference norms that benefit or elevate Brāhmaṇas directly as well as norms 
concerning what is “proper” that Brāhmaṇas alone are in a position to adjudicate. As we have 
1347Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, fol. 2 verso – 3 recto: nyāyena cāpramattas tu naro lobhavivarjitaḥ / dvijebhyo vedavṛddhebhyo datvā pāpāt pramucyate // yasya hy annam upāśnāti brāhmaṇānāṃ śataṃ śatam / hṛṣṭena manasā dattaṃ na sa tiryaggatir bhavet // annasya hi pradānena naro durgaṃ na sevate / tasmād annnaṃ pradātavyam anyāyaparivarjitam //. . . . evaṃ pūrtanirūpeṇa prasaṅge devapratiṣṭhāṃ tāvad āha // 
1499 
seen in earlier chapters, this represents a marked departure not only from influential pratiṣṭhā 
texts such as the Piṅgalāmata, which recognize no such normativity, but also from the canon 
of Purāṇic materials invoked by earlier Dharmaśāstrins such as Lakṣmīdhara. Ad hoc though 
they may be, these standards serve to harmonize these broader categories comprising different 
types of installation practices with Hemādri’s reinvention of the philanthropic procedures in 
general as an almost exclusively Brāhmaṇa-centric domain. 
Since the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati has never been discussed anywhere in print, it is perhaps 
worthwhile to reflect a little on the structure and rhetorical strategies being deployed at least 
in the opening portions of the text, especially as much of what we see is less than transparent. 
Immediately following the theorization of iṣṭāpūrta we have just been exploring, the text offers 
a small section on determining the timing for installing different types of deities (tatra 
pratiṣṭhākālaḥ). All of this material is Hemādri’s own prose. The text then proceeds to offering 
a series of what it calls “paddhatis,” offering detailed accounts of the particular ritual 
sequences to be used for the different deities. Again, within these individual paddhatis, the 
material seems to be composed just for the Caturvargacintāmaṇi. Stylistically, these portions 
of the text look very much like the later portions of the Dānakhaṇḍa we looked at earlier, in 
which long run-on sentences organized around a chain of gerunds in order sequencing a set of 
activities are interspersed with fully scripted and frequently quite lengthy ritual 
pronouncements, outlining to the public everything that is going on in the ritual. Where these 
sub-paddhatis touch upon an issue of general relevance to all the procedures, either concerning 
the nature of a specific ritual agent or of the acts or objects he is making use of, however, the 
compositions interrupt the flow of the step-by-step instructions to offer topical treatments of 
the particular issue. In these cases, Hemādri consistently supplies us with his understanding of 
1500 
the defining characteristics of the ritual actor and the meaning of the technical terms of art, an 
approach that often demands the insertion of proof texts from other sources. 
One very useful way to think about this repeated alteration between these long hyper 
formalized stretches of prose and the introduction of some of the authorities they lean on for 
support is as an act of code switching. Just as we saw when looking at the world of transactional 
quotidian Sanskrit in chapter two, an attentive reading of these stock preliminary summaries 
of long ritual sequences reveals that through them the author is repeatedly instantly rendering 
legible the key details that a professional ritualist is trained to extract and identify from his 
sources. Just as significantly, at the same time as this is being accomplished, these elements 
are being translated into a conceptual vocabulary shared with Pūrva Mīmāṃsā. The rhetorical 
impact of this approach is to demonstrate over and over again that pratiṣṭhā ritual comes 
entirely embedded within and is inseparable from both a learned Brāhmaṇa and specifically 
Smārta framework and ethos, and that this is the case even in places where for dozens of folios 
the text is offering his reader cosmological visualizations and reams of mantras extracted from 
different corpuses within the logically unrelated tradition of the Mantramārga. For, as we are 
about to see, at the same time that a Smārta framework is being presupposed as indispensable, 
our Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati deliberately elides the tradition-specific theologies and methodologies 
pertaining to the veneration of the individual deities, such that, in the end, a functional 
equivalence is simply presumed between Viṣṇu, Śiva, the Goddess, and Sūrya in a manner that 
prefigures early modern pañcāyatana pūjā. As we have seen in many places within the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi, we can recognize the intention behind such efforts as an act of deliberate 
obfuscation, because sometimes Hemādri’s redactions sloppily leave behind fragments from 
older value systems. With this background in mind, we are ready to turn to the text. 
1501 
Now there is the procedure for the ritual application regarding the installation of Viṣṇu.1348 
The general (sāmānya) rituals apply to all the gods (sarvadevānām), the particular (viśeṣa) is described here.1349 [Now, the prayoga:] 
Now, in the region (deśe) to the northeast of the ritual space (āgāra) belonging to the yajamāna, which is smeared with pure stuff [i.e., cow dung] and accompanied by a rangoli, he performs ritual sipping (ācamāna) and is well ornamented with white garments and ointment with gold, silver, kuśa grass, water. . . . Having pronounced the occasion, on the astral conjunction that was indicated by the astrologer, for the sake of the completion of the intended ritual, which involves the installation of the gods or so forth, which is desired to be commenced without obstacles, and for the sake of satisfying wonder-dispensing Gaṇeśa who is acting as a necessary subordinate component [utilized] at the time of the pacification of all the obstacles regarding all undertakings; [Then,] having offered gold, clothes, candana, pan, and fruit, having done the pūjā of the sun, having bestowed a tilak on the swami, having offered pūjā to Mahāgaṇapati, success will be obtained; [As per the quotation”] 
“For a man who is desiring to do the pratiṣṭhā ritual of the gods, having produced the needed implements with regard to all the rituals of the yoginīs. Haivng taken recourse to the five nights, the four nights, three nights, or even one night, such that on the final pakṣa the karmasiddhi will take place, having considered the right day, directly, according to the śāstras, for the installation of the gods, having made offerings on the seven day from the day of the installation of the gods and so forth. . . he should practice the offering of the sprouts of all seeds of karma. Having approached the charming śālā, having satisfied the śilpin, having obtained image and indeed the liṅga of the śilpins, having examined the goods/materials—one should mount it on the chariot and adorn it. . . .” Then, according to the vidhi, one should practice the incubating in water of the god. 
On the day of the beginning of the pratiṣṭhā, having worshipped Gaṇeśa, one should articulate the conditions for the accomplishment of the ritual. And, having worshipped the Brāhmaṇas, having formed an intention for the ritual installation, one should practice the warding off. 1350

1502 
Deploying a terminology strongly reminiscent of the inscriptional record, Hemādri 
begins by suggesting that while the core format for conducting a ritual installation is to be 
applied to “all the gods,” a specialized or particular modification of these procedures is to be 
employed when the object of worship is Viṣṇu. Having introduced this meta-rule, Hemādri 
then proceeds on to offering a summary of the ritual activities that preface a ritual installation. 
Every element of his presentation translates these rituals—all of which originate outside any 
of the ritual realms that Vedic exegetical traditions would have recognized as legitimate—into 
a Mīmāṃsā idiom. It is for this reason that at every step in the process, we are repeatedly 
reminded which ritual agent holds authority over which dimension of the ritual procedure, that 
the key rituals are labelled using technical terms, like karman, even when such designations 
would seem superfluous, and that we are constantly being explicitly told what purpose (artha) 
individual steps in the ritual will serve. The most elegant illustration of how Mīmāṃsaka 
models are shaping this discourse is almost certainly its representation of the role of that 
Gaṇeśa plays in the ritual proceedings, for Hemādri takes great pains to demonstrate that he is 
not serving as “a devatā” in the Mīmāṃsā sense, but is only acting as “a necessary subordinate 
component (antaraṅgabhūta)” whose scope of influence is confined to the opening 
pacification rites. 
When we turn to the unspecified textual sources from which Hemādri has analytically 
derived this ritual procedure, almost immediately, we see that the materials in use, though full 
of the same general details, have nothing to do with the “special ritual” adaptation only to be 
aṅkurārpaṇakaṃ karmabījānāṃ tu samācaret // cār[u]śālāṃ samāsādya śīlpinam paritoṣya ca / śilpinas t[a]t samādāya pratimāṃ liṅgam eva ca // nirīkṣyāvayavāṃ samyag ratham ār[o]pya bhūṣayet / H: jalādhivāsaṃ devasya tato vidhivad ācaret / pratiṣṭhārambhadivase vighneśaṃ paripūjya ca / karmasiddhiṃ samābhāṣya brāhmaṇān paripūjya ca / pratiṣṭhākarmasamkalpa[ṃ] kṛtvā varaṇam ācaret / 
1503 
used when installing Viṣṇu. In fact, they seem to have been extracted from an explicitly Śākta 
ritual milieu that made use of non-standard Sanskrit, and within which rites for appeasing 
yoginīs formed an integral component of pratiṣṭhā. Just as importantly, quite unlike Hemādri’s 
own ritual program, this unknown source does not specify the nature and scope of authority of 
each of the kinds of ritual actors nor is it invested in imposing a hierarchy of significance 
among the different ritual segments, a central concern for the Mīmāṃsā exegete. In this 
alternatively theorized realm, ritual is just one damn thing after another, all of which are 
equally important. 
The Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati is very long and much of it is concerned with ritual procedures 
whose Śākta analogues we have already discussed at some length in chapter 6, or which would 
be familiar to anyone who has spent time with pratiṣṭhā literature in general. So, much like 
good Mīmāṃsakas, we are going to jump ahead to the mukhyadravya—or main ritual details— 
that matter to us. We have skipped ahead through all the ritual preliminaries and are now at the 
point where in any pratiṣṭhā rite, the ritual patron takes his seat, offers homage to the presiding 
religious authority, pronounces his ritual attention, and begins to act under the direction of the 
pratiṣṭhāpanācarya. 
H: Then, upon the bhadrapīṭhā to the east of the ritual space upon the darbha grass, the yajamāna along with his wife, having entered facing east and having done three rounds of prāṇāyāma accompanied by the wife, the one who has begun the sequence should make an intention: 
“Today, proceeded by the destruction of sin of myself, of my father, of my mother, and of twenty-one other people, including myself, and of the ten generations before and of those after, I will do the installation of Viṣṇu, in so far as it is possible, according to place, time and so forth.” 
H: It [the ritual procedure and announcement] is then done the same way regarding another god, and [also] with regards to dredging of the wells, in deploying the various 
1504 
words and so forth, it is to be known [as being the correct procedure in all such cases].1351 
If we go by our documentary records, the medieval Deccan had a mostly generic notion 
of what constitutes a patron. In practice, this social space tended to be occupied perhaps most 
often not by kings or Brāhmaṇa ritualists but by merchants, military commanders, and big men 
from a range of caste backgrounds. In Hemādri’s paddhati, in contrast, the patron is not only 
identified rhetorically with the Vedic role of the yajamāna, but he is required to assume an 
affect and ritual role explicitly derived from that of the twice-born sponsor of a Vedic sacrifice, 
right down to being accompanied in all his efforts by his wife. The mere inclusion of a wife as 
a necessary contributor to the ritual in and of itself deliberately narrows the scope of who can 
be a patron, as it effectively eliminates ascetics of any sort and young warriors on the make— 
to say nothing of women themselves acting as agents—three demographics that surface with 
considerable frequency in earlier sources. Furthermore, once we learn that the paradigm under 
discussion applies to all acts of institutionalization, even digging wells or setting up aqueducts, 
the representation of the yajamāna as “twice-born” effectively shuts down one of the primary 
means that śilpins/ojjas had of leaving their individual mark upon the social landscape through 
sponsoring small scale public works projects. As Hemādri is about to show us, these 
consequences are by no means unintended, but are part and parcel of efforts to inscribe a new 
form of credentialization process that is designed to exclude the previous officials who would 
have played these roles, from the very heart of the ritual. It is for this reason that the forming

of the ritual intention is now to be followed by “the choosing” of the ācāryas, a process that 
within our text involves laying out the standards for their selection, and in ritual itself demands 
the public pronouncement of their credentials. 
H: He should choose the ācāryas and so forth according to the forms as will be described. [As per the citation:] 
“An intelligent one with a good form, who is skilled, who is pure, who has good characteristics who knows the Vedas, the hotṛ should begin the hotra enjoined by the Vedas. The Brāhmaṇa who possesses Śruti—and even one who is solely intent on adjudicating the Vedas—one who is established in ritual, established in tapas, and likewise established in gnosis; one who is not attached, one who has offspring, one without wounds or disease; he is not violent, he is not ego driven, he is intent on the practice of rituals always. He has arisen “from” Āryavārta, and likewise from the land of the black deer. 
The ṛtvijs are endowed with all these characteristics. They are skilled in the rituals for pratiṣṭhā and subordinate to the ācāryas. The ṛgvedic priest, the adhvaryu, the singer of the Sāma Veda, and the even the Atharvan are [examples of] the ṛtvijs, knowers of the Tantras and skilled in the pratiṣṭhā rituals.” 
H: These two [the ṛtvij and ācārya] are endowed with the characteristics: they are in the Brāhmaṇa assembly [i.e., the council], and they are skilled in all rituals.1352 
In place of having a pratiṣṭhāpanācārya who directs the śilpins and serves as their guru, 
Hemādri envisions the installation rituals as being governed by a two-tier managerial system. 
The majority of the ritual action, we are told, is the responsibility of figures called ṛtvijs, who 
are legally subordinated (adhīna) to a governing ācārya, in the same manner a master has 
sovereignty over a servant. Typically speaking, the word ṛtvij is a term of art first found in the 
early Veda that refers to a ritualist who has mastered the Ṛg Veda. For Hemādri, however, the 
term is expanded to include those trained as Sāma, Yajur, and even Atharva Vedic ritualists, 
1352Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, fol. 5 recto – 5 verso: ācāryādīn vakṣyamāṇarūpān vṛṇuyāt // medhāvī rūpavān dakṣaḥ śaucavān śu[bha]lakṣaṇaḥ / vedavid vedavihitaṃ hotā hotram upākramet // brāhmaṇa[ḥ] śrutavāṃś caiva vedanirṇayatataparaḥ / karmaniṣṭhas taponiṣṭh[o] jñānaniṣṭha[s] tathaiva ca // asaṃyuktaḥ prajāyukto rogavraṇavivarjitaḥ / ahiṃsako ‘nahaṃkārī karmābhyāsarataḥ sadā // āryāvartodbhavaḥ kṛṣṇ[a]mṛgadeś[o]dbhavas tathā / etallakṣaṇasampannāḥ pratiṣṭhādikarmakuśalā ācāryādhīnā ṛtvijaḥ / bahvṛco adhvaryur atha chandogātha[r]vaṇāv api / pratiṣṭhākarmanipunāś tantrajñā ṛtvijaḥ smṛtāḥ / sarvalakṣaṇasampannau brahmasadasyau sarvakarmakuśalau / 
1506 
as well as those who merely “adjudicate the Veda,” in other words, Pūrva and Uttara 
Mīmāṃsakas, even if they do not themselves practice the rituals. Instead of themselves being 
born in Āryavārta, as Hemādri clarifies elsewhere, the ritualists need merely to be able to claim 
that they arise from people who had their origins there. At the same time, just as we saw with 
the yajamāna, the imposition of the requirement that ritualists be married householders with 
children works to exclude other classes of professional religious authorities, including the 
yogins who earlier sources had been viewed as playing an integral role in many sorts of 
installations. And since pratiṣṭhā refers not merely to installing deities or even building 
temples but to virtually all forms of institution building—right down to making gardens and 
planting trees—the impact of these changes, just in and of themselves, is to substitute a world 
full of things made by diverse social communities for a world where most things are made by 
or under the direction of Brāhmaṇas. But in fact Hemādri takes things a step further, for in a 
manner that will be instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time reading Dharmaśāstra 
literature, even just Manu, after outlining a whole bunch of best case scenarios for what one 
should hope for in a pratiṣṭhā ritualist, in prose crafted by our author himself seemingly 
supported by no particular proof texts, the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati then offers a bare bones standard 
for what qualifies one to be a ṛtvij or ācārya. The credentials that really matter are rather telling, 
for they are simply that the person is skilled in all the rituals, which earlier we learned entailed 
them “knowing the Tantras” while also being members in good standing “within the Brāhmaṇa 
assembly” (brahmasadas). In other words, in cases where other types of Brāhmaṇas are not 
available, institution building is to be overseen as well executed by the same social elite that 
make up the council of juridical authorities. The same dynamic is even more in evidence when 
1507it comes to the replacement for the pratiṣṭhāpanācārya, now called the sadasya, whose mode 
of self-presentation instantly conveys his extreme degree of privilege. 
Then, he should choose the sadasya and so forth with finger rings, hand ornaments and necklaces, gold earrings. . . . Then facing north, seated on his own āsana, the one who knows Vedānta, arising from Āryavārta, with a shaved head, devoted to the Purāṇas, he is extremely skilled in the main rituals; he is smiling, and he has deep knowledge. 
Having adorned the sadasya, who has conquered the senses, who knows the mantras, and has white clothing, with pearl ornaments, having worshipped, with effort, the sadasya who knows the śāstras with clothes with ornaments and with smearing with good smelling things and garlands.1353 
Thoroughly decked out in the gold Hemādri celebrates doling out en masse to his 
supporters, here the sadasya seems very much the representative of the nouveau riche elite that 
he most certainly would have been. The term sadasya itself had previously referred to the 
Vedic ritualist presiding over a sattra sacrifice. Here, in contrast, the sadasya is celebrated not, 
as we would anticipate, as an embodiment of the Vedic aṅgas or of śāstra, but simply for his 
mastery of Vedānta and devotion to the Purāṇas. As we will explore in the next chapter at some 
length, even as late as the twelfth century—even within Lakṣmīdhara’s Kṛtyakalpataru— these 
are perhaps the two least prestigious bodies of knowledge in South Asia so far as the traditions 
of classical śāstra and classical Tantra were concerned. There is thus every indication that 
people credentialing themselves by claiming mastery over two corpuses of knowledge that 
most traditional pandits and ritualists viewed as somewhere between irrelevant and stupid need 
to be understood as emerging from a different Brāhmaṇical demographic than that of the 
esteemed old families. In fact, despite the almost over the top peppering of lofty sounding 
1353Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, fol. 5 verso: tato varaṇīyasambhṛti[m] upakalpahemakuṇḍalakarakaṇṭhābharaṇ[ā]ṅgulīyakādyalaṃkaraṇair v[ā]sobhiḥ sadasyādīn vṛṇuyāt / tataḥ udaṅmukhaṃ svāsanopaviṣṭaṃ vedāntavidam āryāvartadeśaprasūtaṃ kuśalīkayutaṃ purāṇābhirataṃ prakṛtakarmasv atidakṣaṃ prasannaṃ gambhīrasarasvatīkaṃ, sītāṃbaradharaṃ mantravidaṃ jitendriyaṃ sadasyaṃ muktālaṅkaraṇair alaṅkṛtya pūjayitvā prayatnena sadasyaṃ śāstrakovidam / vastrair ābharaṇaiś caiva gandhamālyānulepanaiḥ //

Vedic terms of art found throughout the prose of our paddhati, the actual contents of the ritual 
procedures prescribes reveals such rhetoric to be a form of neo classicism, spoken by people 
who were no more living inside of a Vaidika mindset than Renaissance era princes who 
obsessively studied the rhetoric of Cicero from childhood onward can be characterized as 
authentically embodying the ethos of Republican and Imperial Rome. When this veneer is 
peeled back and you look at the actual content of the rites themselves, they are thoroughly 
saturated with what are unmistakably Śākta and Śaiva conceptual models. 
Having bowed to [the sadasya], according to injunction, one must perform the offering of the self to him. 
“You are our guru, you are mother and father, you are the Lord, you are the recitation! By your grace, O ṛṣi among Brāhmaṇas, who are unwavering, may everything be achieved by the mind [lit., gone to my mind]. For the sake of release from calamity, do the ritual action called the karuyajña with the ṛtvijs who are pure, disciplined, and well equipped!” With regard to the ritual called the viṣṇupratiṣṭhā, to have accomplished the ritual installation of you people, I choose you of x-gotra of insert x-śarman, with these clothes, ornaments, betel, and so forth [to be] sadasya! 
The reply is: “I am chosen!” Furthermore: 
In this ritual, in order to do the pratiṣṭhā ritual (karma) I choose you as ācārya with the clothes, ornaments, betel and so forth. You, sir, are the embodiment of the form of the mantra here on earth, which is the destroyer of the flood of saṃsāra and so forth.1354 
In this passage, we catch a glimpse of the incongruous appropriation of the dominant 
mode of sociality within the medieval śivapura by a newly arisen Smārta Brāhmaṇa 
professional class. In order to make sense of what sort of rhetorical work this appropriation 
accomplishes, it is worthwhile to first briefly reflect on the paradigm that it is supplanting. 
1354Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, fol. 5 verso – 6 recto: praṇamya vidhivat tasmai ātmānaṃ vinivedayet / tvaṃ no guruḥ pitā mātā tvaṃ prabhuś tvaṃ parāyaṇam / tvatprasādā[c] ca viprarṣe sa[r]vaṃ me syān manogatam / āpadvimokṣaṇārthāya karuyajñam atandritaḥ / ṛtvijbhiḥ sarvataḥ śu[kl]aiḥ saṃyatai[ḥ] susamāhitaiḥ / ācāryeṇa ca saṃyuktaḥ kuru karma yathoditaṃ / viṣṇupratiṣṭhākhye karmaṇi pratiṣṭh[ā]karma kār[a]yitum amukagotra-amukaśarmāṇa[m] ebhir vastr[ā]laṃkaraṇatā[m]būlādibhiḥ sadasyaṃ tvām ahaṃ vṛṇe / vṛto ’smīti prativacanam / tathā / asmin karmaṇi pratiṣṭhākarma kartuṃ vastrālaṃkāratā[m]bulādibhir ācāryaṃ tvām ahaṃ vṛṇe / mantramūrti[r] bhavān atra saṃsārādyaughanāśanaḥ / 
1509 
Within the realm of the śivapura, we need to remember, professionals such as artisans and 
performers, whose livelihoods were effectively inextricable from their inculcation within 
Tantric knowledge systems, as well as Tantric adepts, had typically undergone ritual initiations 
that rendered them subject (adhīna) to the initiating guru. This teacher was from thenceforth 
to be viewed as Śiva himself in human form and became the final juridical and spiritual 
authority in their lives. On both theological and pragmatic grounds, in emic terms, this role 
was seen as carrying with it substantial responsibilities, for the teacher was frequently seen as 
taking on both the literal and karmic debts of his disciples. In short, every element in this 
formulation emphasizes that what was being established is a lasting bond that fundamentally 
changed the initiate’s status. Depending on which tradition within the Mantramārga we are 
discussing, at the time of initiation, the guru either was to extract the soul of the initiate and 
infuse them with the mantra of lineage or, in the case of some Kaula traditions, he was enter 
into the body of disciple and transform him or her from within by leaving a seed representation 
of himself inside the channels and subtle body. Within the Śākta transmissions especially, of 
the sort that were codependent on the artisan and performance traditions so relevant to the 
present context, disciples were to venerate and visualize their initiatory teachers and their 
lineages on a daily basis as part of acts of routine worship. As the Kumārikā Khaṇḍa of the 
Manthāna Bhairava makes plain, this insertion of the veneration of the teacher as a structuring 
element even extended to the celebration of the birthdays of the lineage heads as a major 
calendrical festival. In other words, in very concrete ways, “the surrender” of the soul to a 
teacher was rooted in a lasting relationship, whether real or imagined, instantiated through 
sustained and repeated practice. 
1510 
Despite the fact that our text is mining what conceptually speaking are Mantramārga 
resources, as imagined by the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati the social role of the sadasya diverges 
radically from these older expectations. As Hemādri envisions him, instead of having a 
preexisting personal or ritual relationship with the patron sponsoring an act of institution 
building or with the various professionals who will execute the task, the sadasya is simply an 
elite member of the Brāhmaṇical jurist class whose services have been procured temporarily 
for the occasion. For that matter, despite the fact that during the ritual they are deemed 
subordinated (adhīna) to the sadasya, the ṛtvij ācāryas are also merely hired help with no 
preexisting connection to either their temporary master, the artisans, or the community. In other 
words, what our text is encouraging is essentially a ritualized surrender of personal and 
political authority to a stranger, quite likely serving in the local sabhā, without any pretense 
even of an imagined reciprocity. Indeed, in the formalized script provided by Hemādri, the 
patron is to begin the act of surrendering to this figure—who serves as a stand in for the Vedic 
ṛṣis— even before he has given his assent and chosen the sadasya as the designated authority. 
As we can see, this choice itself is executed in an idiom akin to a contractual establishment of 
a patron client relationship drawn from the world of ephemeral quotidian Sanskrit textuality. 
As the formalized passage makes plain, the sadasya’s authority is purely a function of his 
office, not the product of personal charisma, ascetic accomplishments, or even active sustained 
participation within the knowledge systems of the Mantramārga. In other words, not only do 
the sadasya and his ācāryas potentially lack any meaningful relationships with the other social 
agents involved in the pratiṣṭhā ritual, but they also even lack a meaningful relationship with 
the Tantras themselves. In other words, they are precisely the sort of sthāpaka the Devī Purāṇa 
had anticipated with such agitation, as bringing terror and ruin, one who is “without the 
1511 
āgama,” and who seeks to organize rites using “a common procedure,” instead of entering into 
each individual ritual occasion aligned with what is prescribed by “the different doctrines.” 
Nonetheless, in the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, these agents, who by traditional 
standards would be utterly lacking in adhikāra, for they have not immersed themselves in the 
modes of praxis that produce such a habitus, have acquired for themselves the quintessentially 
Mantramārga derived status of being like “god himself,” or “the embodiments of the form of 
mantra here on earth.” Without engaging in any efforts to actually bestow their grace or 
concrete favor upon the assembled public—for rewards in this system are reserved almost 
exclusively for Brāhmaṇas— the Smārta jurist has usurped the position of the Kālamukha 
sthāpanācārya carrying out the “karuyajña” with all its rhetorical trappings. Deploying what 
is fundamentally originally a Tantric or even Atimārgic repertoire to rather new even 
antithetical ends, the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati transmutes each act of institution building from an 
instantiation of sovereignty within a pluralistic world order to an affirmation of the 
subordination all religious activities to the state and its representatives. 
The considerable irony is that at the very same time that Tantric ritual and conceptual 
materials are operating as the engine that powers all of its rituals, the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati seeks 
to subordinate these elements both logically and rhetorically under a mountain of signifiers 
that while functionally still deriving from the Tantras are marked as performatively Smārta. 
As an illustration of how this works, let us skip past the rest of the ritual preliminaries and turn 
to the moment, immediately preceding the installation rituals themselves, when the sadasya 
and his ācāryas invoke the maṇḍala and prepare themselves to enter into the ritual space. When 
it comes to the maṇḍala itself, the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati offers us two options, both of which are 
treated as functional equivalents. If the deity and its pantheon is aligned with Vaiṣṇava 
1512 
elements (vaiṣṇave), one is to construct a vāruṇamaṇḍala, while in cases where Śaiva imagery 
prevails (śaive) one is to construct a sarvatobhadramaṇḍala.1355 After the text explains how 
each of these two basic formats can be executed at three different scales and degrees of 
elaboration, much like we saw in the Piṅgalāmata, there is a brief worship of the stylus 
(khaṭikā) and measuring thread (sūtra).1356 With the tools of his craft prepared, the ritualists 
then turn to making their own bodies suitable to the task at hand. As Hemādri explains: 
H: Thus, having constructed the auspicious maṇḍala according to the emanation (sṛṣṭi) and/or dissolution (saṃhāra) sequences, having constructed the divinity of one’s own body (tanudaivī) by means of the matṛka nyāsa and so forth, one should begin the pūjā, nyāsa, and so forth: 
“One should sustain (dhārayet) the concentration exercise (dhāraṇā) directly, which destroys the sins of the self. The yau bīja is situated in the cakra of the navel. It consists of smoke and heat and wind [or smoke and fierce wind]. Through meditation, one should separate all sin from the body. Established in the midst of the lotus of the heart, one should recollect the one who has a form made of splendor (tejorūpam). Above and below and horizontal from the navel, one should incinerate impurity by means of the rays. 
One should meditate on the form of the moon— an ocean of nectar established in the sky—which is the syllable vau. The intelligent one should cause the entire body to delight with the winds(?) (conj. from vyādhibhir, “diseases”)1357 of the heart lotus, which are creeping about all the nāḍīs by the path within the interior of the suṣumnā. Thus, having purified his own body, the one who knows the supreme reality, by means of the supreme bīja, [understands/meditates upon] himself as having the nature of the universe, born from the sequence of the sprouts and so forth. Having meditated upon himself as having this nature, then he should commence the nyāsa.”1358 
1355Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, folio 62 recto: tathā // vaiṣṇave vāruṇaṃ proktaṃ / śambhos tu sarvatobhadraṃ lai[ṅ]gaṃ svastikam eva ca / 1356Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, folio 62 recto. See bottom of folio beginning with khaṭikāṃ mānasūtraṃ ca gandhāyair abhipūjayet / 1357Either the practice system here is extremely eccentric or “diseases” (vyādhi) is a textual corruption, perhaps replacing a reference to internal subtle winds (vāyu). 1358Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, folio 62 verso: evaṃ bhadramaṇḍalaṃ nirmāya sṛṣṭisaṃhārakrameṇa māṭrkānyāsādinā svīyāṃ tanudaivīṃ kṛtvā pūjānyāsādy ārabhet / dhāraṇāṃ dhārayet samyag ātmanaḥ kalmaṣ[ā]pah[ā]ṃ / yaubījaṃ nābhicakrasthaṃ dhūmraṃ caṇḍānilātmakam / viśleṣayed aśeṣaṃ tu dhyānāt kāyāt tu kalmaṣam / [hṛ]tpu[ṇ]ḍarīkamadhyasthaṃ tejorūpam anusmaret / adhordh[v]atiryaṅnābhes tu jvālābhiḥ kalmaṣaṃ dahet / vauśaśāṅkākṛti[ṃ] dhyāyed ambarasthaṃ sudhāmbudhim / hṛtpadmavyādhibhir dehaṃ sakalaṃ hlādayet sudhīḥ / suṣumnāyonimārgeṇa sarvanāḍīvisarpibhiḥ / evaṃ saṃśodhya svadehaṃ parabījena tattvavit / aṅkurādikramāj jāt[a]m ātmānaṃ viśvarūpiṇam / evaṃvidham athātmānaṃ dhyātvā ny[ā]sa[ṃ sam]ārabhet / 
1513 
Hemādri here has prescribed that the sadasya and his ācāryas, who we must remember 
are not initiates in a Tantric knowledge system, are to perform what is instantly recognizable 
as a form of bhūtaśūddhi ritual that has as its express purpose the quintessentially Tantric 
divinization of the body.1359 The practice is supposed to commence with a series of focused 
visualizations practices (dhāraṇā) directed at different points in the body, beginning with the 
smoke within navel and culminating within the “sky” or the center of the head. Derived from 
the traditions of Śaiva yoga, these linked visualizations serve two purposes. On the one hand, 
as Hemādri tells us, they separate the body from “sin.” Just like we find in the Śaiva Tantras, 
as opposed to being framed in terms of accumulated karma, Hemādri here treats sin (pāpa) as 
if it is a substance, akin to the notion of an ontic stain (mala) that has to be forcibly burned out 
of the body. While this purification process, engendered by one type of dhāraṇā, is unfolding, 
our text simultaneously prescribes a second order of visualization practice. Commencing with 
an initial ritual identification of the practitioner with the divine splendor (tejorūpī) that resides 
within the center of the heart (this does not seem to be connected to a specific bīja), the 
practitioner is then to meditate on the moon within his forehead which has taken on the form 
of the Tantric seed syllable vau. While the text is not clear about what happens next (though 
based on parallels in other discourses, we would anticipate the body is flooded with nectar), 
apparently through the manipulation of an unspecified “supreme bīja,” the sadasasya and his 
ācāryas identify themselves with the universe in its entirety. This stage of the practice then 
concludes, as the practitioner makes the essentially Kaula-informed conceptual move of 
reversing the polarity between subject and object by taking this identification with the universe 
in its entirety as the object of his meditative focus. 
1359The standard introduction to bhūtaśuddhi remains Gavin D. Flood, The Tantric Body: The Secret Tradition of Hindu Religion (London: I. B. Tauris, 2014). 
1514 
Before we can turn to examining how Hemādri appropriates and subverts the traditional 
methods of the Mantramārga that accomplish the divinization of the body, it is useful to orient 
the reader to just what such methods entailed and how they would have deployed in a more 
typical setting. Now that he has replaced his ordinary human body with a loosely characterized 
divinized body, this is the point in the practice that we would anticipate that—at least within a 
Tantric sādhanā—that the practitioner will begin to reinscribe his form and subjectivity with 
content specific to his initiatory tradition. Just as will happen in the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, this 
task is accomplished through the practice of ritual imposition (nyāsa), which typically involves 
the projection of visualized images or seed syllables onto the different parts of the human hand 
or body. While in some cases, as in the construction of the “hand of Śiva,” where bījas are 
installed on the five fingers, these nyāsa practices can be localized and brief, especially in the 
later classical Śākta Tantras aligned with Kubjikā, and the emergent tradition of Śrīvidyā, there 
is a tendency to “stack” independent nyāsa sequences, often derived originally from different 
traditions, one on top of one another. 
The nyāsa procedures Hemādri teaches in the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati are considerably more 
elaborate than similar practices one finds in contemporary Tantric sources. Thus, while the 
Kumārika Khaṇḍa of Kubjikā traditions, for instance, limits itself to a six-phase nyāsa, the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi in fact prescribes a sixteen-fold nyāsa.1360 Introduced just before the 
Sadasya, the ācāryas and the crew make their initial contact with the image that is to be 
installed, the practice contains the following components: 1) praṇava-nyāsa, 2) vyāhṛti-nyāsa, 
3) mātṛkā-nyāsa, 4) kāla-nyāsa, 5) varṇa-nyāsa, 6) toya-nyāsa, 7) veda-nyāsa, 8) vairāj- 
nyāsa, 9) devayonī-nyāsa, 10) dvādaśadevatā-nyāsa, 11) kratu-nyāsa, 12) guṇa-nyāsa, 13) 
1360With some slight digressions, the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati’s nyāsa sequences occupy folios 62–73. 
1515 
āyudhā-nyāsa, 14) śakti-nyāsa, 15) mantra[mārga]nyāsa, 16) jīva-nyāsa. We will explore 
some of these in more detail in a minute. As you may already be noticing just based on the 
names, large portions of this practice incorporate what were originally entire Atimārga and 
Mantramārga ritual systems. But, these older practices are embedded alongside and often 
beneath “a new revelation,” to which our author gives conceptual priority. And as we are about 
to see, that tradition, much of which seems to have invented just for this occasion, celebrates 
the twofold division of the sanātanadharmas that proclaims its allegiance to a fusion of Śrauta 
and especially Smārta tradition. 
Now, given their understanding of how mantras work, this Smārta appropriation of the 
practice of nyāsa would seem to pose a serious conceptual problem. Nyāsa, on the simplest 
level, involves the manipulation of bījas as well as mantra sequences as means of imbuing the 
practitioner’s body and subjectivity with the powers inherent in those syllables. The practice 
makes sense precisely because it is predicated on believing that the mantras are themselves the 
deities. But this complete identification of deities and principles with non-semantic Sanskrit 
bījas is essentially a Tantric idea for which the newly codified Smārta system, which as we 
have seen throughout this chapter, grounds its theory of mantra in resources it borrows at least 
in part from the Mīmāṃsakas, has no equivalent. In Mīmāṃsā, in contrast, the meaning of 
mantras is mostly irrelevant, for while the individual words within a mantra are supposed to 
all have meaning, even if some of them have been lost over time, taken as a unit they serve an 
indicative function, pointing the ritualist towards identifying the deity governing the ritual. As 
we are going to see, Hemādri’s Smārta nyāsas simply repeatedly center litanies of proper 
names and nouns—only some of which refer to deities—but all of which are indicative of the 
same interpretive context, namely, the world of the sanātanadharmas. Succinctly, Hemādri’s 
1516 
sixteen-fold nyāsa envisions that the practitioner is to travel about in a vehicle that, while 
powered by the technology of the Mantramārga, has its every surface thoroughly encompassed 
by Smārta advertising. 
In our exploration of Hemādri’s sixteen-fold nyāsa, we will primarily attend to seams 
in the text indicative of its heterogenous nature and diverse points of origin. Thus, for example, 
the second nyāsa, or vyāhṛti-nyāsa, prescribes the imposition of the different subcomponents 
of the quintessentially Brāhmaṇical Savitra Gāyatrī mantra, on the feet, heart, and in the cavity 
of the skull. Despite the plausibly Śākta connotations of the name māṭrkā-nyāsa, the third stage 
in the practice simply involves the installation of the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet onto the 
body, beginning with the vowels and culminating with consonant clusters arranged in terms of 
varga. It is here that things become increasingly strange. In the kāla-nyāsa, first the planets, 
constellations, other important astrological elements, and the months of the year are mapped 
onto the human body, and then the process is repeated using the different yugas and other time 
frames. Apart from the absence of any bījas, this could almost be a cousin of the much- 
understudied kālacakra practices taught in many of the Śākta Tantras. The same, however, 
cannot be said for the varṇa-nyāsa that follows immediately afterwards, for here the meaning 
of varṇa is quite simply the identities of Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, and so forth, all of which are to 
be mapped onto the body. Not only do we see here a literal grafting of a part of the social order 
onto the divinized body that is supposed to be identical with the universe, a practice of course 
as old as the Puruṣasūkta, but the text even introduces post-Vedic conceptual components 
integral to policing caste relations as key elements of the practice. Thus, caste mixing in general 
(saṅkara) as well as anuloma marriages—where the male is higher caste than his partner—are 
ritually projected onto soles of the practitioner’s right and left feet, assigned inauspicious 
1517places right alongside the animals of the village (grāmapaśu) and those of the wilderness 
(araṇyapaśu) in what is essence a representation of the great chain of being. Following a brief 
projection of forms of water (toya-nyāsa), that descends from the clouds (megha) down to the 
ocean (samudrā), the text next introduces a “veda-nyāsa.” As we might by now expect, here 
Hemādri teaches that the eighth imposition involves superimposing the four Vedas, the 
vidyāsthānas, and the disciplines of śāstra, beginning from the Ṛg Veda and concluding with 
Nīti and Vaśyaśāstra (perhaps referring to indrajāla?) onto the divinized body, again 
suggesting an implicit argument that an emerging vision of Brāhmaṇical normativity is integral 
to all viable forms of ritual power.1361 
The eleventh stage in the practice, the so-called kratu-nyāsa, makes such a very un- 
Vedic use of ostensibly Vaidika materials that it reads like a modern exercise in cultural 
appropriation, every bit as incongruous—even outrageous—to a “real Srauta ritualist” as when 
yoga studios put an mūrti of Gaṇeśa right above the toilet or an attendee at Bhakti Fest gets the 
Gāyatrī tattooed above her belly button. 
1361In a similar spirit, the vairāja or devayonī mantra maps a hodge-podge of Vedic deities and Purāṇic figures, many of which, such as Hiraṇyagarbha, Nārada and Prahlāda, are associated with the traditions of devotional Vedānta, onto a body, rounding out its lists with canonical categories of types of wombs, yakṣa, gandharva, and the like, in which a person may achieve rebirth. Hemādri next begins to incorporate devotional theistic religion into this field of discourse. This will ultimately prove to be a rather involved and multistep process. Elsewhere its intended end is that Vaiṣṇava and Śaiva mythology, treated as unified field, are to be understood as functionally equivalent optionalities that are theologically identical and closely linked with Vedic knowledge. At this point in the text, however, no such optionality is invoked, and we are simply provided with a single format for what the text calls a mūrti-nyāsa. Mūrti-nyāsa prescribes the imposition on the body of a variation on the incarnations of Viṣṇu, in which the typical ten avatāras are supplemented with an additional list comprised of Keśava, Nārāyaṇa, Mādhva, Govinda, Vaiṣṇava, Madhusūdana, Trivikrama, Vāmana [sic], Śrīdhara, Hṛṣīkeśa, Padmanābha, and Damodara. As scholars of Vaiṣṇavism will probably have noticed, these additional names are the first ten of a set of twenty-four epithets frequently recited in Vaiṣṇava ritual communities, with our list terminating right before the introduction of the vyūhas of the Pañcarātra system. It is very likely that Hemādri has himself joined these together with the preceding list of daśāvatāra, for this formulation conspicuously repeats the figure Vāmana, the dwarf, who now appears in both lists. What is fascinating about this inclusion is that unlike most of the other theistic materials in the text, the extended list of incarnations of Viṣṇu are not treated as forms of knowledge that are tradition-specific to Vaiṣṇavas but instead are understood as part of the common cultural heritage of anyone participating in temple life. Clearly, we have come a long way from the late-eighth- or early-ninth-century Piṅgalāmata, where, so that the artisans could craft appropriate images, the goddess had to inquire with the god what that whole and decidedly “foreign” incarnation thing was all about. 
1518 
On the forehead, [place] the horse sacrifice. On the upper palate, place the human sacrifice. On the face, the royal sacrifice; on the throat, the cow sacrifice. . . . In the navel, the ahīnas (sattra); on the knees the sarvajits; on the penis, the agniṣṭoma; on the other side of the penis, the atirātra; the aptoryāma on the two thighs; the ṣoḍaśins go on the flanks; the utkthya on the left shank; the vājapeya on the right shank; the atyagniṣṭoma on the right arm; the caturmāsyas on the left; the sautrāmaṇi on the hands; the parśva-iṣṭis on the fingers; the darśapūrṇamāsas on the eyes; the sarva-iṣṭis in the pores; the syllables svāhā, and vaṣat on the two arms; the pañcamahāyajñas beneath the soles of the feet; and, the āhavanīya fire on the head; and the dakṣiṇāgni in the heart; and the gārhapati fire on the arms; and the vedī in the heart; the pravargya on the ornaments. . . . darbha grass upon the hair. . . .1362 
Hemādri here appears to have taken several previously discrete canons of Vedic 
sacrifices, inclusive of many exceptionally arcane and rarely practiced forms of Soma 
sacrifices, and strung them all together, filling in the gaps with stray elements used in sacrifice, 
such as the darbha grass, much in the same manner as one would decorate a Christmas tree. 
And just as holiday ornaments may have spent many years in the attic gathering dust, only to 
be taken out for special occasions, much the same is the case with Hemādri’s Śrautism, which 
amounts to a miscellany of very different things haphazardly assembled together on account 
of the fact that they all look decoratively Vedic. Though on the surface, the correlation of 
sacrifices to specific parts of the body appears evocative of the bandhu logic of the Brāhmaṇas, 
when one looks at the actual contents of these supposed parallels individually, they seem 
neither to be the product of careful reflection on points of commonality nor a continuation of 
older formations from the Brāhmaṇa literature. Indeed, the randomness and carelessness of 
many of these selections—why select the generic ahīna without representing the generic sattra

sacrifice?—why invoke the virtually nonexistent term sarvajit as opposed to the standard 
viśvajit?—all suggest a certain superficiality in Hemādri’s command of Śrauta knowledge. 
This shallowness in our author’s command over traditional “Brāhmaṇical” materials is 
starkly in contrast to the intimate understanding and precision that orders the sequences in the 
nyāsa that immediately follow it, wherein the materials being used are derived from the worlds 
of the Atimārga and Mantramārga, both of whose canons Hemādri has surreptitiously mined 
and cited without attribution throughout the paddhati. During the next five nyāsas, each of 
which are given in both Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava variants, the practitioner invokes the parivāra, 
weapons, and attributes of the supreme deity (either Sadāśiva or Vāsudeva) and constructs the 
throne upon which the deity sits, which is perched on top of the hierarchy of worlds. Here, for 
example, is a small selection from the nyāsa of the guṇas, the preliminary act in the sequence, 
offered with occasional Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava variants: 
oṃ hāṃ prakṛtitattvāya namaḥ / oṃ hāṃ prakṛtitattvādhipataye pitāmahāya namaḥ / oṃ hā[ṃ] puruṣatattvāya namaḥ / oṃ hāṃ puruṣatattvādhipataye viṣṇave namaḥ / 
oṃ hāṃ sadāśivatattvāya namaḥ / oṃ hāṃ sadāśivatattvādhipataye ajeśāya namaḥ / oṃ hāṃ kālatattvāya namaḥ / oṃ hāṃ kālatattvādhipataye ṛtudhvajāya namaḥ / oṃ hāṃ vidyātattvāya namaḥ / oṃ hāṃ vidyātattvādhipataye viṣṇave namaḥ / 
oṃ hāṃ cakrādyāyudhacihnebhyo namaḥ /

śaive aṣṭatriṃśat[t]attvebhyo namaḥ / aṣṭatri[ṃ]śat[t]attvādhipebhyo namaḥ /1363 
After having installed the elements and the tanmātras, which, apart from occasional 
divergences on who is the presiding deity, are treated as identical in the two systems, as we 
ascend up to the veneration of more subtle ontic levels, the text begins to offer us two sets of 
1363Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, fol. 39 verso. 
1520 
options, both of them within a Tantric framework. Rather atypically, once we get past puruṣa 
and prakṛti, the text places sadāśivattatva as subordinated to kāla and vidyā, each of which in 
turn is subordinated to Viṣṇu and his weapons. In this shared fused cosmology, however, the 
two founts of theistic religion themselves take second place to the elements, and the three 
domains of the fire, the sun, and the moon, so central to post-classical Śākta traditions. The 
section concludes by indicating that Śaivas can emend this visualization (śaive— 
aṣṭatriṃśatattvebhyo namaḥ) to incorporate some more elements of their traditions. In doing 
so, however it invokes, not the expected thirty-six but thirty-eight tattvas, which are to be 
superimposed “on top” of the already invoked sāmānya Saṃkhyā-derived map of the cosmos. 
At our current state of knowledge, identifying Hemādri’s exact sources is not yet possible, but 
it is telling that Abhinavagupta, who also knows of this variation in the enumeration of ontic 
levels, identifies tattvas 37 and 38, respectively with Bhairavatattva and Kālasaṃkarṣiṇītattva, 
strongly suggesting this system’s point of origin in the scriptures of the pre-philosophical Kālī 
Krama, perhaps among materials that make their way into the later divisions of the 
Jayadrathayāmala. 
Very much taking the opposite stance of tradition specific sectarianism, when Hemādri 
turns to the question of envisioning the presiding deities, he reframes them in a manner that 
emphasizes points of commonality. For example, he suggests that the core theological 
principles that support each version of the throne—dharma, jñāna, vairāgya, and aiśvarya— 
are identical for Śaivas and Vaiṣṇavas. He even suggests that, despite divergences in the names 
and imagery the weapons and the entourages associated with the two pantheons, as they are 
made up of an equal number of components, we should understand them as operating as 
tradition specific optionalities that are functionally equivalent. Departing from what was taught 
1521 
in the Devī Purāṇa, however, where which ritual actor should install what deity is determined 
by which system is appropriate, Hemādri asserts that suitability to the task is not determined 
at all by the type of ritual actor performing the rite and their initiations, for the 
Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati asserts that those remain constant in all cases. Instead, what is determinative 
is purely the identity of the deity that is being placed inside of the temple.1364 In both cases, 
again, our author has rearranged these elements to maximize the appearance of apparent 
commonalities. Within such a framework, the text is implicitly arguing being Vaiṣṇava or 
being Śaiva is primarily evocative not of distinctive worldviews, but different approaches to 
ritual style. 
Just as this delimitation of pantheons—just the two options with minimal internal 
variation— offers us functionally analogous parallel sets of preferences with minor variations, 
so too are the mantra systems deployed by the practitioner during the sixteen-fold nyāsa upon 
his own body largely mirrored in the ritual mechanics that the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati prescribes for 
preparation of bases and the installation of images. As the final stage of the sixteen-part nyāsa, 
the Caturvargacintāmaṇi teaches what it calls the jīva-nyāsa—the ritual installation of the 
soul. The same procedure in an expanded form also is deployed during the act most commonly 
called prāṇapratiṣṭhā, when the deity is made to take residence in the image, what our text 
calls pratimājīvanyāsa. In a substantial terminological departure from what we typically find 
in the classical Tantras, repudiating one of the core theological claims of a Śākta worldview of 
reality pervaded by powers (śakti) in Hemādri’s Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, the sadasya, ācārya, 
1364For Śaiva “workings,” we learn, the ritual system to be used here is the śrīkaṇṭhanyāsa, the pañcabrahmamantras, and something called the Śaiva dvādaśākṣaramantra whose syllables are aligned with set of twelve rudras, beginning with the figure of Śarva. For Vaiṣṇavas, in contrast, one is to use a narasiṃhanyāsa, which bears a family resemblance to the one found in the kalpa of the Sāttvatasaṃhitā. The dvādaśākṣara in use is oṃ namo bhagavate vasudevāya, and the Vaiṣṇava twelve-syllable mantra whose components are correlated to a set of twelve aspects of Viṣṇu, well-known to early modern Vaiṣṇava communities. 
1522 
yājamāna, and śilpins are never depicted manipulating or embodying “powers.” Instead, as 
they work their craft, they fuse their subjectivities with atom-like “souls” (jīvas). As the text 
tells us, these souls come to us accompanied by adjuncts or impositions; the word often used 
is upādhi, a term of art borrowed from Vedānta that, while not integral to the nature of souls 
themselves, result in the manifestation of specific qualities and ontic modalities (bhāvas). The 
manner in which one works with these principles is the same regardless of whether the site into 
which they will be made to enter is the human body or an object, and is also independent of 
the apparent nature of the deity being installed. Through a preliminary practice of prāṇāyāma, 
the ritualists cause different breaths into enter into distinctive channels.1365 Using the praṇava 
mantras, the practitioner brings the unmarked puruṣa who is a pervader (vyāpin) to rest in the 
cavity within the eight-petalled lotus in the heart. Through the use of a whole array of mantras, 
the puruṣa is then “made” into a jīva through the superimposition of series of qualities, 
including the tanmātras and the elements, the jīvātman, and paramātman. The ritualist joins 
(saṃyojya) his own self to the image, and the puṇḍarīkātman is then invoked from his heart 
into the heart of the image. The ritualist now makes himself identical in his bhāva with the 
witness of all things (sarvasākṣiṇaṃ bhāvayitvā).1366 This enables the installation of something 
called the sarvātman, followed by the puruṣātman, an act that is accompanied by the recitation 
of the passage in the Svetāśvatara Upaniṣad that speaks of the supreme reality as having faces 
everywhere (sarvatomukha). Finally, the grace bestowing nature (anugrahātman), the nature 
of making up everything (sarvabhūtāman), and the three functions of creation, maintenance, 
and dissolution are infused into the deity, at which point either the practitioner or the image 
awakens to its true nature. This nature—the real identity of both person and deity—is expressed 
1365The udāna, for example, is brought through the brahmarandhra or its insentient equivalent. 1366Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, bottom of folio 71. 
1523 
in a language that is deliberately crafted so as to be devoid of either explicitly Śaiva or 
Vaiṣṇava technical terms of art. The implicit message is that while at lower levels of 
articulation, different circumstances may call for the use of different mantra systems, 
ultimately the “one who sees everything” transcends all dualities. At least within the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi itself, for Hemādri’s later writings will express a different point of view, 
this supreme deity is neither Śiva nor Viṣṇu but something that incorporates or transcends both 
of them. Elsewhere in the Pariśeṣakhaṇḍa, where the matter comes up in passing, Hemādri 
directs his readers to the explanations he had offered in the Mokṣakhaṇḍa as well as in the 
second division on pratiṣṭhā, both parts of our text that have yet to surface in manuscript. 
Though we will not pursue the matter further, there is good reason to believe that Hemādri 
himself identified this supreme reality with the Harihara principle, which in the present age 
has assumed the form of the patron deity of the later Seuṇa kings, Viṭṭhal at Pandharpur. 
With this new presumption of an exoteric undifferentiated universal nature as the 
undifferentiated principle that animates reality comes a new commitment to transparency in 
ritual. If all images are functionally the same thing and the ritual installer is always the same 
“establishment” person who in his daily life is at once responsible for the management of a 
varṇāśramadharma oriented social order and answers to an increasingly centralized 
surveillance state, it logically follows that there is no need for any secrets at all, let alone a 
hidden esoteric regiment of practices offering an alternative theory of sovereignty that falls 
outside the state. From the perspective of the emerging new social order, both those responsible 
for the preservation and transmission of those secrets and those secrets themselves are utterly 
superfluous, and that is before one begins to take into consideration that this obsolete 
demographic is sitting on top of much of the wealth and property of the Deccan. Thus, for both 
1524 
political as well as theological reasons, the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati reimagines almost every stage 
of ritual to minimize potential opportunities for the old guard to keep peddling their outmoded 
wares. This reinvention begins with a complete spatial reorientation of the workings of ritual. 
Succinctly, the vast majority of activities that were previously conducted either off site or 
inside of a private space within the temple such as the garbhagṛha are now performed in public, 
either outside or alongside the temple or in maṇḍapas and other pavilions, and before a public. 
Even at places in the ritual where it is essentially unavoidable that certain activities have to be 
performed inside of a closed structure, the sadasya and the artisans are never left alone to 
themselves, but are always accompanied by Vedic ritualists who are not part of their team but 
paid on spec. It is probably not an accident that it is precisely at the junctures in the ritual where 
the older order, represented for example by the Piṅgalāmata, would have imbued public acts 
with secret private meanings or clandestinely conducted parallel events for initiates, that the 
Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati deploys the ṛtvijs to go about reciting Vedic ṛcs, fumigating the space with 
the air of the new orthopraxy. 
Here, for example, is how the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati treats the period while the image of 
the deity is incubating. This activity now happens underneath an open-air pavilion—a pavilion 
that is in fact built using ritual procedures that Hemādri himself identifies in the Vratakhaṇḍa 
as being derived from the Piṅgalāmata itself! In the Piṅgalāmata, this event marks the 
occasion for staging public utsavas for the public during the day and gatherings where 
vīradravya is consumed by initiates at night.1367 Needless to say, Hemādri proposes a rather 
different approach: 
1367In a similar place in the proceedings, the Piṅgalāmata had prescribed: One should let four days pass with festivals of song and dance and with the sounding of bells and ḍamarus. Offering flowers, dhūpa, naivedya, betel and so forth [the event continues] with celestial festivals day and night. . . . At night there is bestowing of the awakening performance [jāgran] with the sounding from the dance and song. In regard to the general [i.e., the 
1525 
This is the procedure for the incubation of the god and temple and so forth. 
Then, having passed the night in the awakening (jāgaraṇe), [the celebration is to be done] with the recitations of Purāṇa, instrumental music, and Veda. In the morning, outside, the teacher, having bathed, having done the occasional rituals, is accompanied by the mūrtipas. Having gone to the yāgamaṇḍapa, having enjoined the worship for the eastern door and so forth, having done the pūjā of the banners, pots, vastumaṇḍala, and ritual site, in each respective pit, with the mūlamantra, having oblated a hundred and eight times with the śānti substances to each deity with the mantras of the image, the mūrtipati, and the lords of the world, having offered the pūrṇāhuti, having given to the mūrtidhara the brahma stone in the form of a turtle and the piṇḍikā that are to be incubated along with it, and having utilized the protector with the Indra mantra, accompanied by the sounds of pacification, it is led counterclockwise to the prāsāda. 
Having sprinkled the garbhagṛha in a couterclockwise fashion with pacification water and [water purified by] the astra mantra to ward off obstacles, with a stream of flowers and water. . . . using the [Vedic] mantra that begins “mahāṃ indro vajra bahur,” having inscribed [the space] with that mantra, again having sprinkled all around with water purified by the astra mantra, [they enter] into the middle of the womb of the door [to the garbhagṛha.]1368 
Prior to recovering the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, on the basis of what could be inferred from 
other sections of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi,1369 I had assumed that the domesticated model of 
temple construction Hemādri teaches was largely indebted to the late classical tradition of the 
Śaiva Siddhānta, which from the eleventh century onward increasingly acclimated itself to 
emerging neo-Brāhmaṇical norms. Through its continued incorporation at key points in the 
non-transgressive procedure] one should only do those festivals during the day. By day, the sattra is to not to be stopped; one should donate to the non-lordly (i.e., the poor). By day unceasingly one should give feasts to the poor and orphans. . . . Then at night, [the giving of feasts] it is carried out among the vīras and the yoginīs and the kārukas. And at nighttime, and at the end of the day, one should make use of the food and drink to be enjoyed by the vīras and so forth. The festival with the song and dance along with instruments is during the daytime. See the full discussion in chapter 6. 1368Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, fol. 84 verso – 85 recto: iti devapr[ā]sādādyadhivāsanavidhiḥ / tataḥ purāṇagītavedādipāṭhai[r] jāgar[a]ṇe niśām [a]tivāhya prātar ācāryaḥ snātvā naimittikaṃ karma kṛtvā mūrtipānvito yāgamaṇḍapam etya [sic] pūrvādidvārapūjāṃ vidhāya dhvajakalaśavāstuvedīmaṇḍalādipūjāṃ kṛtvā sve sve kuṇḍe mūlamantreṇa mūrtimūrtipatilokeśamantraiḥ // pratidevam aṣṭottaraśataṃ śāntidravyeṇa hutvā pūrṇāhutiṃ datvā mūrtidharaṃ sahādhivāsitāṃ kūrmabrahmaśilāṃ piṇḍikāṃ ca trātāram indramantreṇa gṛhītvā śāntighoṣeṇa pradakṣiṇaṃ prāsādam ānīy[ā]stramantreṇa [śantātiyena conj. śāntitoyena?] ca vighn[ani]vāraṇāya vāstuvardhanīpuṣpodakadhārayā pradakṣiṇaṃ prāsādagarbham abhyukṣya mahāṃ indro vajrabāhur iti mantreṇa samullikhya punar astrapūtavāriṇā sarvataḥ prokṣya dvāragarbhamadhyaṃ. . . . / 1369These do indeed draw upon older recensions of the Kāmikā Āgama as well as the Bṛhatkālottara, plausibly suggesting a primarily Saiddhāntika interpretive milieu. 
1526 
ritual of elements and theological claims utterly alien to Śaiva Siddhānta discourse, such as the 
thirty-eight-level tattva system, however, the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati itself unexpectedly and 
repeatedly disproves this hypothesis. In light of our close reading in chapter 6 of the centrality 
of the worship of Caṇḍeśvara both to a posited archaic artisan religiosity among the kārukas 
and to the Śākta traditions maintained by the Kālamukhas into which this tradition was 
absorbed, it is fitting that we close our exploration of the ritual systems propounded in the 
Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati by looking at how what is essentially a Smārta ritual manual appropriated 
and preserved key components of kāruka viśvakarman religion. In fact, throughout the text as 
a whole, especially in passages that Hemādri attributes to “the Viśvakarmamata,” we 
intermittently keep encountering Caṇḍeśvara, often paired with Sarasvatī as his Śakti, woven 
into mantra sequences and visualizations in rhetorically significant places. While as one would 
anticipate, given our author’s theological commitments, during the installation process itself 
there is no trace of the “secret” as a material object nor is there a complementary clandestine 
ritual system being enacted alongside the installation of the public deity, as we reach the final 
day of the ritual process, uncanny commonalities begin to reassert themselves. 
Through by making the sadasya simply an elite member of the community hired just 
for the occasion, Hemādri has effectively elided the role of the sthāpanācārya as at once a 
ritual professional and the actual initiatory guru from the ritual process. Just as we saw in the 
Piṅgalāmata, as the ritual comes to an end, this conceptual choice poses a methodological 
problem, for one of the roles assigned to the sthāpanācārya is to use his powers and his 
command to “make the ritual complete.”1370 
1370Piṅgalāmata, Pratiṣṭhāpaṭala: “[He proclaims], ‘from my grace, the result of this ceremony has become characterized as having the nature of a completed liṅga.’ Whatever the particular the aim that was desired [by each assembled person], he should invite the others to enjoy that sort of result. . . . Recollecting the Śiva-state, 
1527Hemādri’s unexpected solution is to assign this role not to a person but to a deity. As 
it so happens, that deity is Caṇḍeśvara: 
Having meditated thus, with the stated mantras, having performed the upacārapūjā, one should petition: “Whether from knowledge or ignorance, whatever is deficient or extraneous, let all that be complete, O Caṇḍanātha, by your command! So long as the liṅga stands, the god of gods, Maheśvara, within it, for that much time, O Caṇḍa, may you remain in the presence of Śiva.1371 
The Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati next turns to describing Caṇḍeśvara’s ritual function. At first 
glance, it would seem that Caṇḍeśvara is simply a servant of the Supreme deity set up as the 
designated consumer of ritual refuse (nirmālya), just as in parallel Śaiva Siddhānta sources. 
And then, out of the blue, having first indicated the general rule, the text itself introduces a 
stipulation that for its intended audience would have effectively ruled out such a possibility. 
“Fruits, roots, food, and drink and so forth, tambūla, garlands and ointment—the consuming of nirmālya is given to you, indeed, by the command of Śiva.” 
Having bowed, he should give the first bali offering. 
“Caṇḍa is not authorized [however], with regard to a bāṇaliṅga, an iron liṅga, a siddhiliṅga, or a self-arisen one, and in regard to all images.”1372 
As an attentive reader may have noticed, back in chapter 6, we have already 
encountered substantial scholastic reflection by Tantric authors working within the tradition of 
the Śaiva Siddhānta on this very same issue. In his own writings on Caṇḍeśvara, for example, 
the guru makes [the ritual] complete and even. With his left hand, the ācārya should worship with sweet smelling things and flowers, and he should offer an argha to the top of the liṅga.” See chapter 6 for further discussion. 1371Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, fol. 98 verso: evaṃ dhyātvoktamantrair upacārapūjā[ṃ] vidhāya prārthayet // jñānato ’jñānato vā ‘pi yan [n]yūnam adhikaṃ kṛtam / tat sarvaṃ pūrṇam evāstu caṇḍanātha tavājñāyā // yāvat tiṣṭhati liṅge ’smin devadevo maheśvaraḥ / tāvatkālaṃ tvayā caṇḍa sthātavyaṃ śivasannidhau // The incongruity of choosing to have a subordinated Caṇḍeśvara play this role as the completer of the sacrifice is indicative of an older system where Caṇḍeśvara was the presiding deity of the whole ritual is strongly suggested by the parallels in the Vaiṣṇava application, where the agent who make the ritual “complete” is Viṣṇu himself.

Dominic Goodall directs our attention to a passage in the thirteenth-century Saiddhāntika 
Jñānaśiva’s thirteenth century Jñānaratnāvalī. And as we can see below, Jñānaśiva, almost a 
direct contemporary of Hemādri, is unambiguous in his assertion that any text that excludes 
caṇḍeśvarapūjā from forming an essential component of the rituals associated with 
bāṇaliṅgas, siddhiliṅgas, svayambhūva liṅgas, or mūrtis by definition cannot belong to the 
tradition of the Śaiva Siddhānta: 
Surely [PP] 
In the case of a bāṇaliṅga, a portable one, ones that have risen [from rivers], one established by a Siddha, a spontaneously arisen one and in the case of all [representational] images, Caṇḍa has no authority. [So too] in the case of one in which there is visualization of a non-dual [deity such as Bhairava or Tumburu]. And also in the case of rites for the Lord [installed] on the ground. 
Others, however, [opine:] 
No worship of Caṇḍa [is to be performed] when the [image of] the Lord has been crafted either. 
How can [such a view as] that [be maintained]? True. [But] this is [in fact] a prohibition of the installation of Caṇḍa and not a prohibition of his worship. This is advanced as somebody else’s doctrine. In the Śaiva Siddhānta, however, the rule is that he should always and in every case be worshipped. And this is expressed in the Kālottara: 
Whether the liṅga is stable or portable, or made of precious stone, clay, wood, rock, iron, or is represented in a picture, or is a bāṇaliṅga, [the worship of] Caṇḍa remains determined by rule (niyāmakaḥ) in the Siddhānta, but not in other tantric traditions: neither in the Vāmasrotas nor in the Dakṣiṇasrotas.1373 
Following the Kālottara, Jñānaśiva assigns the methodological stance that certain 
focuses of worship do not fall under the jurisdiction of Caṇḍeśvara, and thus by implication 
that the things offered to them do not become nirmālya, to either the Vāma or Dakṣiṇa 
transmissions. This is to say, he associates it with the domains that, as we have seen, the Devī 
1373Dominic Goodall, “Who is Caṇḍeśa?” In Genesis and Development of Tantrism, ed. Shingo Einoo (Tokyo: Institute of Oriental Culture, University of Tokyo, 2009), 365. Emphasis added. 
1529 
Purāṇa associates with “the best among the sthāpakas,” which by our period have come to be 
occupied by the Kālamukhas and their śilpin or kāruka disciples. Just as we saw in the 
Piṅgalāmata, a work that the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā had assigned to the Vāmasrotas alongside the 
Mataṅgapārameśvara, which also preserves these features, the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati has also 
retained strong indications that it has inherited an older system of values in which Caṇḍeśvara 
stands in for Śiva as the Lord of the universe. 
On the fourth day after the installation of the liṅga or the day after that, outside of the base of the temple [jagatī] in the īśāna direction, according to half the measure of the garbhagṛha of the temple, in house of moon, having practiced the pīṭhanyāsa and so forth, [one is to do the following mantras:] 
oṃ caṇḍanāya namaḥ / oṃ caṇḍeśvarāya hūṃ phaṭ svāhā / Thus, having summoned [him, one recites:] oṃ caṇḍāya hṛdāya hūṃ phaṭ namaḥ oṃ caṇḍakavacāya hu[ṃ] phaṭ namaḥ / oṃ caṇḍāstrāya hu[ṃ] phaṭ namaḥ / 
oṃ caṇḍasadyojātāya hum phaṭ namaḥ / oṃ riṃ [caṇḍa]1374vāmadevāya huṃ phaṭ namaḥ / oṃ raḥ [caṇḍā]ghorāya huṃ phat namaḥ / oṃ [caṇḍa]tatpuruṣāya [huṃ phaṭ namaḥ] / oṃ cāṃ [caṇḍa][ī]śānāya [huṃ phaṭ namaḥ] /1375 
May there be homage to you Caṇḍanāyaka the fierce lord, who is the origin of the fire of Rudra, and terrifying. He bears a śūla and a daṇḍa and has four faces and four arms. He has twelve red eyes and a great fire that spews forth from his mouth. He is adorned with a moon, a crown, and dread locks, and a small bracelet/earring. He has a serpent for his sacred thread, and ascetic’s pot along with a mālā. He is seated on a white āsana. He destroys afflictions through devotion and humility. . . . He is the inconceivable one, the lord of Viśvarūpa. Homage to you, with genuflection out of devotion.1376 
1374As is often his practice in delineating mantras, the scribe makes a small dot rather than repeating the name in the mantra that is present in each iteration. It is not reasonable to think that in practice the word “caṇḍa” would have been repeated in each case. A more conservative reading would see the initial retention of the term as holdover from the pre-redacted source material. 1375Mantras are reproduced exactly as found in the manuscript, including irregular lengthening of bījas. 1376Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, fol. 97 verso – 98 recto: atha śaive caṇḍapratiṣṭhocyate / liṅgapratiṣṭhopari caturthe dine dināntare vā / jagatībāhya iśānyadiśi prāsād[a]garbhārdhamānena candragrahe pīṭhanyāsādi vidhāya / oṃ caṇḍāya namaḥ / oṃ caṇḍeśvarāya huṃ phaṭ svāhā ity āvāhya / oṃ caṇḍāya hṛḍayāya huṃ phaṭ namaḥ / oṃ caṇḍakavacāya hu[ṃ] phaṭ namaḥ / oṃ caṇḍāstrāya hu[ṃ] phaṭ namaḥ / oṃ caṇḍadsadyojātāya huṃ phaṭ namaḥ / oṃ riṃ vāmadevāya huṃ phaṭ namaḥ / oṃ raḥ aghorāya huṃ phaṭ namaḥ / oṃ tatpuruṣāya huṃ phaṭ namaḥ / oṃ cāṃ [ī]śānāya huṃ phaṭ namaḥ / rudrāgneḥ prabhavaṃ caṇḍanāyakaṃ ca bhayānakam / śūladaṇḍadharaṃ raudraṃ caturvaktraṃ caturbhujam / mukhodgīrṇamahājvālaṃ raktadvādaśa- locanam / jaṭāmukuṭa-induma[ṇ]ḍitaṃ kaṇikaṃkaṇi / vyālayajñopavītaṃ ca sākṣasūtrakama[ṇ]ḍaluṃ / śvetapadmāsanāsīnaṃ bhaktiprahvārtināśanam /. . . . acintyaṃ viśvarūpeśaṃ bhaktinam[r]anamo ‘stu te / 
1530 
In the prose ritual instructions that precede the mantra system and the visualization, 
which have been composed by Hemādri himself, though even here we see some continuities, 
Caṇḍeśvara’s role is much diminished. Though the old association with “the place of the 
moon” has been retained, instead of residing in a closed structure of equal dimensions to the 
garbhagṛha of the main focus of worship in the temple, Caṇḍeśvara is now installed in a 
permanent open pavilion outside of the temple in a space that has half the dimension of the 
main focus of worship. Like so many other features of the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, every element 
of this realignment serves to undercut the older ritual system in which the “real” esoteric god, 
who instantiated a radical rejection of the very idea of ritual purity through distributing his 
offerings as blessings to everyone, resided in the place the moon.1377 
When we turn from Hemādri’s own prose to the unattributed “traditional sources” that 
he has retained for liturgical purposes, however, a very different dynamic is in evidence, 
beginning with the mantras themselves. As Goodall has observed in other contexts, while one 
would anticipate that a mere servant of the deity would be assigned a single seed syllable for 
his mantra, here Caṇḍeśvara is given the five-part mantra nyāsa of a sort that is otherwise 
reserved for Śiva and the goddess. Even more tellingly, beginning with the mantra “oṃ 
caṇḍasadyojātāya hum phaṭ namaḥ,” this five-part nyāsa then appears to be followed by the 
unprecedented invocation of the five faces of Śiva as extensions of Caṇḍeśvara himself. The 
dhyāna that immediately follows maintains this identification throughout, invoking 
Caṇḍeśvara as the terrifying lord of the world in the form of a four faced Atimārgic deity. The 
iconography in evidence, even many of the terms of art, largely overlaps with the visualizations 
1377As we might anticipate, the pīṭhanyāsa, has also been reworked. Though deploying a version of the śrīkaṇṭhanyāsa, the new krama deliberately excludes the presence of dangerous goddesses by replacing the mantras of kriyā śakti with ṛcs from the Ṛg and Atharva Vedas. 
1531 
given in the Piṅgalāmata.1378 Instead of being identified with “the wrath of god,” here 
Caṇḍeśvara is understood as the “origin of the fire of Rudra,” in other words, the source of the 
cosmic fire that destroys the universe at the end of the kalpa. And while these cosmic 
affiliations abound, conspicuously absent from these passages are any allusions to Caṇḍeśvara 
as a disciplinary force, responsible for example for inflicting punishment on those who break 
samaya codes, of the sort one would expect to find in Siddhānta aligned practice systems. 
Hemādri’s deliberate retention of these formal elements in the liturgy coincide with 
considerable efforts to undercut the Śākta theological vision of the tradition of Caṇḍeśvara, 
especially its radical inclusivism and outright rejection of notions of purity and impurity. For 
before, during, and after the god is installed, the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati performatively seeks to 
overwrite the Śākta approaches to the redistribution of food, goods, and value as well as its 
more transgressive and sanguinary dimensions. In this new ritual system, once the deity is 
installed inside of the temple—the only major activity conducted inside of the temple out of 
the view of the public—the ācārya and his ṛtvijs, but noticeably not the artisans, offer a series 
of śānti rites in which a vegetarian and non-transgressive form of caru—quite unlike the 
concoction contained inside “the secret”—is fed into the fires to the accompaniment of Vadika 
mantras. Once this act is completed, the ritual refuse produced during the installation of the 
deity is gathered up and brought before Caṇḍeśvara, while at the same time, the ācārya—who 
does not share with anyone—is fed the wholesome caru.1379 
1378The significant variation that the ṭaṅka of the deity has been replaced by a club, a formulation that may well precede the Tantras, suggests an Atimārgic origin for some of these materials. 1379In the paddhati itself, the presentation of these different facets of the ritual are actually scattered over the surrounding folios, such that (in a passage I have not included) we learn, first (fol. 96 verso), that an offering contained within a closed pot is to be made during the ritual, and then, after some text intervenes, that is to be made to the guru and both of these things happen long before we are informed about the contents of that offering, which actually happens after virtually the entirety of our text’s discussion of Caṇḍeśvara and his role in ritual. Rhetorically the impact is to utterly marginalize the part of the ritual that would have corresponded to the offering and consumption of the cāru in older systems; perhaps this choice is intentional and polemical. To avoid confusing 
1532 
Once the sadasya has been fed, accompanied by the yajamāna, bearing the ritual refuse, 
he goes before Caṇḍeśvara so that the rite can be completed. In place of the sharing of the joy 
(anumodana), which in the Piṅgalāmata the guru distributed to everyone assembled at the end 
of rite, here the sthāpaka simply pleads to the deity on behalf of the community. Once it is 
clear the deity has accepted this offering, Caṇḍeśvara receives a series of baths designed to 
ensure that he is clean. 
“O lord, for the sake of the pacification of the flood of sins, may the pūjā of this yajamāna, the bathing and giving of enjoyments be accepted—it [this result] is brought near1380 by me”. . . . One should begin the bath at the place situated on the right side, preceded by the statements of hail along with sounds of trumpet, the conch, the recitation of auspicious things, the Devasūkta, and other such sounds.1381 
a modern reader, I have rearranged the presentation of these details so that first we are informed about what is given to the guru at the same moment that we see outlined the different phases of the ritual procedure. 
Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, “One should give [to the guru] yogurt, akṣata grain, the tips of kuśa grass and milk or honey, barley, along with fruits and flowers for the attainment of desires. . . . The installation of “all the gods” applies to a garden of trees, a pond, or in regard to images, with regard to rituals of improvement and renovation, or with regard to replacement that has to be done, and with regard to temples, pots, and so forth. All of this is the common system, which is stated in the Śruti, Smṛti, and Āgamas.

The ritual that follows, which incorporates the use of powdered marijuana and entails the worship of the previously Śākta aligned sandals of a Śākta siddha, a procedure that has been Vedicized and domesticated, is of considerable interest. Thus, despite numerous issues with the text, it has presented below in a preliminary fashion. “Having set down the pādukas on the footstool, having dressed it with bathing clothes, having worshipped along with lights, incense, flowers, and scents, having anointed it with oil and fragrance, having made a powder. . . there is the bathing in the purified unction water. . . with acacia flower (śirīṣa), indigo, and sunflower, along with water full of powder that contains kuśa grass and sida cordifolia (sahadevī), there is the “wiping” of the body. With the words “śa[ṃ] no devī”. . . with the mantra “agnim mūrdhānam [divo apratiṣkutam tamīmahe namasā vājinam bṛhat],” there is the offering of the murā plant (myrrh), the kuṣṭa (dolomiaea costus), a coconut, the fragrant root of the uśira plant (vetiver), fragrant flowers, vālaka plants (fragrant swamp mallow), the chaste tree, reṇukā (chaste tree), turmeric, and haridrādvaya (turmeric extract), for the sake of siddhi.

1533 
Now housed in an outdoor pavilion, the antithesis of his traditional abode, the ancient 
one Caṇḍeśvara—the god who gave things to everyone and for whom everything was 
considered pure—is bathed again and again in the service of purification to the sounds of 
pacification mantras drawn from Ṛg and Atharva Vedas. In a similar spirit, the conclusion of 
the ritual incorporates two conceptual elements very much at odds with the milieu from which 
the practices had sprung. On the one hand, we have an act of sin-eating, which benefits only 
the patron. On the other, there is the offering of a coconut coated in turmeric and steeped in 
extracts from a cornucopia of flowers and intoxicants in lieu of “the best of sacrifices”—at a 
moment where either an animal or a human being was to be decapitated and placed upon the 
pādukas. Succinctly, while on the surface Hemādri has preserved many of the formal 
dimensions found in his sources, his knife-like mind has set itself to the task of trimming out 
the core theology that animates these texts with the critical intelligence and deftness of a 
surgeon. In a systematic manner, what takes the place of this old order of values is the 
promotion of a theological-political model promoting the universality of dharma that 
consistently selects against practices suggestive of the episteme it has just dethroned and those 
orders of society that are demographically likely to attempt to clandestinely perpetuate it. 
This seems an opportune moment to introduce the reader to what from a modern 
perspective is one of the most unsavory dimensions of our Dharmaśāstra, namely, the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s robust discourses on the moral necessity of excluding and expelling 
from the realm of ritual any “subversive” elements clinging to the now deposed paradigms of 
the early medieval Deccan. In attending to this task, we will begin with examining the 
Notice the use of the so-called Atharvavedic Sailila hymn 1.6. Interestingly, the Kauśuikasūtra, which offers ritual applications for Atharvan mantras, prescribes the hymn is to be recited for śāntyudaka as well as in several other contexts related to pacification rites. 
1534 
prescriptions offered by the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati at its conclusion, which warn of the moral 
danger of permitting the occurrence of deviant practice in the realm of institution building 
before concluding with a closely related discourse in the Śrāddhakalpa on policing the 
demographics among ritual attendees at all public acts of commemoration and institution 
building. Here, then, in Hemādri’s own words, is how the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati concludes: 
The installation of all the gods (sarvadevānāṃ) is stated by the Śruti, the Smṛti, and the Āgamas. Have rummaged through the Purāṇas and other things, it is related by Hemādri Suri. 
Whatever else is discerned in accordance with what is contained within another system, that also is to be employed here [but only] in so far as it is not contradictory [with the structures governing] place, time, and so forth [as taught within our system]. . . . 
One is not authorized to perform the installation ritual merely having had recourse to the śāstra. One who knows the Vedas and who knows the principles of ritual practice is worthy to do it. 
A person of little knowledge (alpajña), who, out of ignorance or greed, desires to do the ritual installation of the gods, should be forcibly restrained by the kings. 
For, by the king, who acts according to dharma and desires the increase of dharma, all of the rituals in his kingdom must be done, directly, in accordance with the śāstra. . . . 
For, there are many people who want to do it [pratiṣṭhā] who do not know the mantras (amantrajñāḥ). The suppression (nigraha) of [such people] is to be done by the kings out of fear for the destruction of the kingdom. 
The lowest of men does not correctly know the procedures for nyāsa and homa. He is not to be considered an ācārya. He is to be seized like a thief. . . . 
Thus, having seen that the triple worlds were impoverished in the recitation of dharma, due to the power of the kali [age] by him, acting out of concern for the assistance of the triple worlds, the lovely “Wish-Fulfilling Gem” was manifested. Śrī Hemādri, the lord of all the śrīkaraṇas who are connected to Mahādeva, king of kings, is skilled in all the vidyās. Contained within the Pariśeṣa Khaṇḍa of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, in which he has composed the elaboration on the iṣṭāpūrtadharma, that paddhati concerning the installation of all the gods is completed—Offering to Viṭṭhal.1382 
1382Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, fol. 109 verso – 110 recto: prati[ṣṭhā] sarvadevānāṃ śrutismṛtyāgamoditā / purāṇādi samaloḍya proktā hemādrisūriṇā / tantrāntarānusāreṇa yac cānyad api vīkṣyate / tad apy atra niyoktavya[ṃ] deśakālāvirodhi yat / karmānuṣṭhān[a]bhūyastvān phalabhūyastvadarśanāt / kevalaṃ śāstram āśritya pratiṣṭhākarmanārhati // 3// karmānuṣṭhānatattvajño vedajñaḥ karturm arhati / ajñānād yadi vā 
1535 
As this division of his work draws to a close, Hemādri takes great pains to drive home 
a quintessential dimension of his interpretive project that was perhaps in danger of getting lost 
amidst a sea of ritual details. Quite simply, the comprehensiveness of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi 
is implicitly an argument for its self-sufficiency. In other words, Hemādri is presenting his own 
work as constituting in and of itself an entire knowledge system, whose strictures anyone else’s 
interventions into these same domains will have to obey and whose standards they will have 
to match. As we will see in much more detail in the next chapter, the Caturvargacintāmaṇi 
offers itself to its intended readers as both a canon of content and a method. As Hemādri 
suggests here in the second verse, while the former is amiable to further expansion—such that, 
for example, one might add to a list of observances (vrata) by drawing on further Purāṇas or 
integrate a set of procedures for building a well or temple with different shapes or 
proportions—the latter is fixed and inflexible. The terms of these restrictions are at once 
demographic and ideological. While having access to “the śāstra” is absolutely necessary if 
one wishes to perform any act of institution building (pratiṣṭhā), however humble, in and of 
itself it is hardly sufficient, for one must also know the Veda. What might not be immediately 
apparent is that by “the śāstra,” Hemādri refers not to scholarly learning in general but, quite 
pointedly, to his own text. In other words, the Caturvargacintāmaṇi is telling us, over and over, 
that if you want to do anything “the right way,” you will have to rely on the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi. 
lobhād alpajñaḥ kartum icchati // 4 // pratiṣṭhākarma devānāṃ niyantavyaḥ sa rājabhiḥ / rājñā dharmapravṛttena dharmavṛddhiṃ abhīpsitā // 5 // svarāṣṭre sarvakarmāṇi samyak kar[y]āṇi śāstrataḥ / amantrajñā hi bahavaḥ kartum icchanti sarvadā // 6 // teṣāṃ tu nigrahaḥ kāryo rāṣṭrabhaṅg[a]bhayā[n] nṛpaiḥ / nyāsahomavidhiṃ samyak na jānāti dvijādhamaḥ // 7 // ācāryo na sa mantavyo nigrāhyas taskaro tathā / cintāmaṇau mahāśāstre kṛte. . . . athāmunā dharmakathādaridraṃ trailokyam ālokya kaler balena / tasyopakāre dadhatānucintāṃ cintāmaṇiḥ prādurakāri cāruḥ / iti śrīmahārājādhi[r]āj[a]-śrīmahādevīya-samastakaraṇādhīśvara-samastavidyāviśārada- śrīhemādriviracite caturvargacintāmaṇau pariśeṣa-kha[ṇ]ḍe iṣṭāpūrtadharmanirūpaṇe sarvadevatāpratiṣṭhā- karmapaddhati[ḥ] samāptaḥ / śrīviṭṭhalārpaṇam / 
1536 
By extension, everyone who does not take the Caturvargacintāmaṇi as their 
methodological and ideological lodestone is by definition a person of little knowledge 
(alpajña) and a person who does not know the mantras (amantrajña). And, since doing things 
“the right way” is more important in this paradigm than doing things “effectively,” such wrong 
modes of doing and being, which inculcate a divergent model of the social order grounded in 
divergent networks of sentiment and solidarity, can hardly be tolerated. They threaten the 
“harmony of the world,” at least if one believes that the world is harmonious in so much as it 
matches up to the idealized models laid out in the Caturvargacintāmaṇi. Indeed, in a certain 
sense, Hemādri is entirely right. Whatever their background, anyone who has not been trained 
under his direction is virtually guaranteed not to know the “right procedures” and the “right 
mantras.” The very simple reason why this necessarily would have been the case is that, though 
individual elements in the rites he prescribed have their own earlier histories, as pre- 
systematized ritual units, the methods and mantra sequences taught in the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati 
had no prior discursive life outside this text itself. 
In other words, in crafting his Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati, Hemādri has deliberately and 
summarily set out to dismiss and decredentialize an entire industry and everyone who works 
in it. Their expertise deemed obsolete, the very pool of pratiṣṭhāpanācāryas and their crews 
who made the institutional worlds of the Deccan and had for centuries been acclaimed as 
among the most learned people on the subcontinent are rebranded. Instead of being celebrated 
as tantraviśārada in every sense of these multifaceted terms, now they are “men of little 
knowledge” who act “out of greed or ignorance.” Because acts of ritual and institution building 
are above all else performances of values that make experientially real the norms that inform 
them for those who participate within their frames, the activities of these people are deemed a 
1537threat to the health and power of the state. Just like what we saw happening at Kukkunur, where 
after its “liberation” the Kālamukhas were expunged from the historical record and the esoteric 
deities of the Mantramārga and Vidyāpīṭha whom they tended were summarily replaced by a 
pantheon comprised of “all the gods,” the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati demands that “the lowest of men 
who does not correctly know the procedures for nyāsa and homa”—and indeed how could 
they, for Hemādri has invented both of these ex nihilo—"is not considered an ācārya.” Instead 
of the kings of the Deccan stepping outside of their own domains and going before such figures 
as supplicants who are seeking wisdom, power, and council, Hemādri proposes a new royal 
program. From henceforth, it is incumbent upon any king to treat such people as thieves. If the 
kingdom is to survive, let alone flourish, they must be quickly identified and then forcibly 
suppressed. 
The term here that Hemādri repeatedly deploys in describing this disciplinary regime, 
quite interestingly, is nigraha. Depending on context, this is a word that can mean suppression, 
restraint, imprisonment, or even destruction, and it likely that here most if not all of these 
applications are intended. As a term of art, however, nigraha has special additional rhetorical 
significance, for it is situated at the heart of the emic theory of just what it means to be a king. 
Vijñāneśvara, for example, tells us at the beginning of his commentary on Yājñavalkya’s 
division on vyavahāra, “the supreme dharma (paramo dharmaḥ) of the king is the protection

medieval Deccan, one of the key components of the responsibility of the king to protect his 
people had been understood as entailing the protection of dharma through the preservation in 
perpetuity of the individuated sovereignty of the undying land grants and their administrators. 
The king’s role as protector against “bad people,” in contrast, is treated as a conceptually 
subsidiary duty, largely homologized with the preservation of the rule of law, and given 
considerably less rhetorical emphasis. Far from being restricted to simply the king himself, this 
same dictum was viewed as being relevant for any local big-man who wields disciplinary 
power. This is why both aspects of its implementation, protecting the people through protecting 
the dharma embodied in the land along with protecting the people from enemy raiders and 
brigands with his mighty bow, could feature prominently in the professional self-representation 
of a Śākta Śūdra gangster such as Habbĕya Nāyaka operating in remote regions in the shadows 
of the mountains. 
For a big man like Habbĕya just as much as for a king, however, the “duṣṭajana” under 
consideration were simply understood as people who preyed upon the population, such as 
thieves, murderers, and brigands. Vijñāneśvara1384 himself also seems to adhere to a similar 
standard, for though he councils that in regard to a bad person, disciplinary power (daṇḍa) 
must be deployed directly and immediately (duṣṭe samyagdaṇḍaḥ prayoktavyaḥ) his catalog 
of what makes something bad, whether we are talking about thoughts and impulses that must

be suppressed (also called nigraha) through self-discipline, or thieves, liars, frauds, violent 
criminals, and murderers, is in no way framed in doctrinally specific terms. As we have seen 
in chapter 3, in this earlier discourse, “difference” (bheda) in ritual or conduct is not only never 
labelled duṣṭa by the authorities, but the king is explicitly instructed that within its respective 
domain it is to be protected using the full resources and authority at his disposal. Thus, in this 
context, the suppression of people is about punishing material crimes as defined under the law 
and not about summarily punishing “ideological deviancy,” wherever and whenever it might 
occur. Though not entirely lacking in historical precedent, especially earlier in history and 
elsewhere on the subcontinent, in terms of the norms that animate the prescriptive and 
documentary records in use throughout the medieval Deccan, what Hemādri is proposing 
amounts to a stark break from tradition. Even when compared with their peers, the Seuṇa 
Yādava rulers of earlier generations were unusually eloquent and vocal advocates for what can 
only be described as something more than mere religious tolerance.1385 From henceforth, under 
the Seuṇa Yādavas, at least in theory, through the newly trained cadres of Brāhmaṇa authorities 
it has recruited for just such a purpose, the state is supposed to closely monitor every act of 
institution building. Where their services are not employed and Caturvargacintāmaṇi-derived 
“best practices” are not followed, the institution is to be disrupted and its managers expelled, 
imprisoned, or even killed. 
“Outcasting “Difference”: The Making of the Tantric Subaltern 
Though monitoring acts of institution building and renewal, and intervening when they conflict 
with the “best practices’” of the new professional class, represent a much higher priority for 
1385N. Lakshminarayan Rao, ed., South Indian Inscriptions vol. XVIII: Bombay Karnatak Inscriptions vol. III (New Delhi: Archaeological Survey of India, 1975), 279–80.

the securing of a new Yādava ecumene grounded in the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s vision, an 
analogous dynamic is also at work in the realm of occasional rituals, with considerable 
attention being devoted to policing what sort of people should and should not be included. 
Once we recognize that the very heart of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s reimagining of what it 
means to “be Brāhmaṇa” entails the recasting of the Dharmaśāstrin primarily as the 
administrator and overseer of the quotidian religious lives of the population, the rationale for 
this focus on governing and monitoring rituals of very different sorts becomes immediately 
clear. It is certainly no accident that, at least in the portion of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi that has 
been edited and published, the greatest care and attention that Hemādri directs to thinking 
through in painstaking details the ins and outs of any ritual system, including the for us 
exceptionally pertinent matter of who is to be expelled from the sacrifice, is directed towards 
the topic of śrāddha rites. 
The choice is clearly highly strategic. As Matthew Sayers has demonstrated1386 
convincingly and at some length, such rituals form a logical conceptual bridge between 
classical Śrauta, pre-dharmanibandha Smārta, and dharmanibandha style religious praxis. In 
selecting śrāddha as the test case for thinking through the workings and boundaries of ritual, 
Hemādri is able to make a convincing case for the continuities between the piṇḍapitṛyajña of 
the Vedas proper, the four-fold śrāddha ritual of the Gṛhyasūtras, and the at least twelve types 
1386Matthew Sayers, Feeding the Dead: Ancestor Worship in Ancient India (New York: Oxford University Press, 2013). Sayers offers a painstaking historicization of the procedural and rhetorical continuities and discontinuities among ancestor rituals as they developed in the Vedic corpus proper, within the Gṛhyasūtras, and the emergent codifications of śrāddha reflected within the Dharmasūtras. The scope of his study sadly does not extend even to the world of early Dharmaśāstra. Much of his conceptual apparatus is derived from an early study by Knipe, and the historical work he offers is nicely complemented by Knipe’s more wide-ranging and acutely theorized engagements with ancestor rites in South Asia, which are deeply informed by anthropological work conducted in numerous parts of the subcontinent and among very different demographics. Knipe’s work has been recently anthologized as: David Knipe, The Hindu Rite of Entry into Heaven: Essays on Death and Ancestors in Hinduism (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 2019). 
1541 
of “Purāṇic” śrāddha recognized by the dharmanibandha Smārtas, and thus, by extension, for 
the canonicity of the new Smārta mode of religion. Just as importantly, however, though they 
had originated as a ritual honoring the ancestors on specific delimited occasions, embedded 
within other Vedic rituals, governed by calendrical concerns, or marking the death of the 
sacrificer’s parents, over time, the scope of śrāddha ritual expanded so far beyond this ritual 
function that they had effectively become a standard approach to sanctifying pretty much any 
kind of special occasion, such as celebration of victory, a marriage, the birth of a son, starting 
out on pilgrimage, commencing or concluding medical treatment, or performing public forms 
of theistic worship.1387 Nor was the influence of this ritual form restricted to domains where 
Vaidika Brāhmaṇas were the only religious authorities. By the eighth century, Tantric 
variations of śrāddha1388 have been adapted into Śaiva and Śākta revelations and codifications 
of the ritual are prescribed in the ninth- and eleventh-century paddhatis of Brahmaśambhu and 
1387In terms of the taxonomization of śrāddha, our best resource remains Kane’s magisterial, though often quite partisan, History of Dharmaśāstra. The discussion of śrāddha, contained within the fourth volume, begins on pg. 334 and culminates around pg. 679, which is already exploring the overlap between śrāddha discourse and the discourse on tīrtha. The exploration of categories of śrāddha according to various sources is tersely covered between pg. 380–83. P. V. Kane, History of Dharmaśāstra, 8 vols. (Pune: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1930–1962). 1388Tantric materials on śrāddha, both in terms of the classical period and in the quite textually rich world of the early modern tantranibandha, which especially in Kaula sources often have elaborate discussions of lineage- specific śrāddha rituals, have until recently received virtually no attention. A welcome foray into correcting this oversight, though somewhat constrained by its near exclusive focus on the traditions of the Śaiva Siddhānta, is found in the fifth chapter of Nina Mirnig’s recent monograph on Śaiva death rituals, which argues for a relatively late accommodation of the ritual within Śaiva domains. Nina Mirnig, Liberating the Liberated: Early Śaiva Tantric Death Rites (Vienna; Austrian Academy of Sciences, 2018). It is this pioneering works which informs our discussion of the Śaiva sources. Based on admittedly impressionistic engagements with the Śākta materials, suggestions emerge of a parallel dynamic either of late adoption or a post-hoc attempt to homologize what was originally an independent system of praxis within a recognizably śrāddha paradigm. This would explain Jayaratha’s framing of Abhinavagupta’s comments at the beginning of the Tantrāloka’s twenty fifth chapter that some people have asked skeptically where in the Trika system is the name śrāddhavidhi uttered. Abhinavagupta’s explanation is that within the Siddha Tantras, while the term is nowhere in evidence, the same practice is referred to when the scriptures speak of the necessity for feeding the vīras at the time of a death rite. Even so, the primary sources that both authors will lean upon in the remainder of the chapter are mostly derived from the Śaiva Siddhānta. Abhinavagupta, Tantrāloka vs. 25.1–2, with Jayaratha’s commentary: atha śrāddhavidhiḥ śrīmatṣaḍardhokto nigadyate // nanu trikadarśane kutra nāma asau śrāddhavidhir uktaḥ ity āśaṅkyāha— siddhātantre sūcito ‘sau mūrtiyāganirūpaṇe / sūcita iti— na tu sākṣāt svakaṇṭhenoktaḥ / yaduktam tatra “mṛtakasya gṛhe vātha kartavyaṃ vīrabhojanam” / 
1542 
Somaśambhu of the Śaivasiddhānta as well as in the twenty-fifth chapter of the tenth-century 
Tantrāloka of Abhinavagupta.1389 Succinctly, even before we take into account the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s own efforts to add to the instances where śrāddha rites are performed, 
by the thirteenth century, this ritual form would have effectively punctuated most of the 
important moments in many people’s lives. 
In the next chapter, we will examine in some detail how Hemādri’s treatment of the 
śrāddha ritual provides his readers with a hermeneutical skeleton key to understanding both 
the theology and method that underlies his vision of the universalization of Hindu dharma. For 
the moment, however, let us restrict our focus to the much narrower task of examining the 
disciplinary dimensions of the śrāddha ritual as a means of policing who is to be included and 
excluded from meaningful social moments. Like so many other modalities we have examined 
throughout our investigations, within the various sources that nibandhas draw upon, the rules 
for who is invited to sponsor, to attend, and to be fed at śrāddha rites not only vary in 
substantive and significant ways from text to text, but even within a single text are highly 
dependent upon the specific type of śrāddha rite under consideration. For example, if a specific 
type of śrāddha rite involves an offering of liquor and meat to the bhūtas and piśācas, with the 
remainder from that offering being fed to the attendees at the conclusion of the rite, ascetics 
who have taken vows that prohibit the consumption of such substances under any 
circumstances are prohibited from participating. In the nibandha literature, however—for this 
is a case where, though he provides an order of magnitude more detail, Hemādri is building 
upon some precedents set by Lakṣmīdhara—the bare effect of bringing together these disparate 
strictures and compiling them in a single framework where they are treated as complementary 
1389Though it stipulates that the rite serves no purpose for the enlightened yogin, chapter 25 of the Tantrāloka is entirely dedicated to a discussion of śrāddha rites. 
1543 
elements of single system markedly changes the nature of the conversation. In the 
Śrāddhakalpa of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, the section on who is to be forbidden from being 
fed after the śrāddha rite and who is to be driven away from a site where śrāddha rituals are 
taking place runs more than a hundred pages. By the time all of the types of social agents who 
cannot participate have been delineated, which Hemādri does with great precision in his 
commentary on the sources, much of society has been excluded. For Hemādri, however 
(seemingly in distinction from his source), one of the key objectives in these sections is to lay 
a foundation for the unambiguous exclusion of the ruling authorities of the Śaiva Age from 
every significant aspect of social and religious life. 
Let us take, for example, the manner in which the text frames the general rules for 
feeding ascetics at the śrāddha. 
H: Śātātapaḥ says, “One should feed the ascetics (yati).” And with regard to that, a qualification is stated. As is stated in the Brahmavaivarta: 
“At the time of śrāddha, one should drive away (varjjayet) bald-headed ones (muṇḍas), those with dread locks, and those with red robes. You should pay off (pradāpayet) the ones with scalp tufts, those reddened with dhātu marks, and those with triple notched staves. However, the ones who are always established in their vows, are knowledgeable, and are meditators, are devoted to the gods, and are great souls, they, being all those things, cause purification by mere sight alone.” 
H: Muṇḍas means ones with bald heads along with a top knot. The jaṭilas means Śaivas, Pāśupatas, Kālamukhas, and so forth. The robed ones mean those who have for their clothes red and brown robes, such as figgies(?) (āśvatthas).1390 
As you will by now anticipate, faced with the core conceptual problem that the Smṛti 
texts do not actually make the arguments that he wants them to make, Hemādri qualifies the 
1390Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Śrāddhakalpa, pg. 423: āha śātātapaḥ / yatīn bhojayediti / H: tatra viśeṣa uktaḥ / brahmavaivartte— muṇḍān jaṭilakāṣāyān śrāddhakāle vivarjayet / śikhibhyo dhāturaktebhyas tridaṇḍibhyaḥ pradāpayet // te hi vratasthitā nityaṃ jñānino dhyāninas tathā / devabhaktā mahātmānaḥ punīyur darśanād api // H: muṇḍāḥ śikhayā saha muṇḍitamastakāḥ / jaṭilāḥ śaivapāsupatakālamukhādayaḥ / kāṣāyāḥ āśvatthādikaṣāyaraktavasanāḥ // Āśvattha as the name for a class of ascetic or a religious community seems to be otherwise unattested and one might suspect a textual corruption. 
1544 
teachings of Dharmaśāstra with statements from an unrelated source, the Brahmavaivarta 
Purāṇa, which in its current published iteration is virtually an addendum to the Bhāgavata 
Purāṇa. Though the Rādhā-centric iteration of this work now available to us is almost certainly 
quite different from the version available to Hemādri in the thirteenth century, given the rest 
of his use of this text, the recension from which this extract was drawn expressed roughly 
analogous and unambiguously Vaiṣṇava commitments that informed its exclusion of its Śaiva 
rivals. Even so, the text as written does not really speak very clearly to his exact concerns, and 
so he must flesh out his intended message through his commentary. In each case, he tweaks 
the construal of the term present in the root text considerably. The end result is to exclude from 
the śrāddha all of the major competing types of religious authorities. 
In place of people with shaved heads, an accoutrement that could arise from a range of 
communities and circumstances, Hemādri excludes perhaps the most orthodox-presenting 
form of Brāhmaṇa, known especially from south India, whose head is adorned solely by a top 
knot. People with dreadlocks again represents an underspecified category that in fact does not 
exclude all the social agents that defined the Śaiva Age, since some of them did not wear 
dreadlocks. Just as problematically, the category could also incorporate slightly more 
acceptable varieties of philosopher ascetics, like Pātañjalian yogins, of whom Hemādri 
approves. As Hemādri’s predecessor in the field of Dharmaśāstra, Medhātithi would have it, 
jāṭila might even simply refer to Brāhmaṇa students who have not completed their studies and 
thus do not have the adult privilege of participating in śrāddhas. For this reason, our author 
spells out explicitly that what the text intends is that one is to drive away Śaivas, Pāśupatas, 
Kālamukhas, and so forth. In other words, the whole panoply of ritual agents who might have 
been attending and conducting śrāddha rites in lieu of Smārta Brāhmaṇa Dharmaśāstrins are 
1545 
now to be expelled. Finally, because the category of robed ones could potentially be interpreted 
as demanding that Hemādri’s precious Vedāntins, the future Daśanāmīs, might be excluded 
from the very roles for which they are being cultivated, the prohibition is adapted to specify 
only brown and red robes, perhaps intending the deselection of Buddhists. Saffron, in contrast, 
is deemed perfectly fine. 
The passage we have just examined introduces a substantial section exploring the 
different rules and restrictions for including yatis in the śrāddha, such as what do you do with 
ascetics who have taken a vow to eat nothing or only one food. Most of these are largely 
irrelevant to our concerns. The interesting point is that Hemādri has chosen this particular focus 
as his framing mechanism in organizing his text. He will return to it several times within the 
discourse, including at the end. Rhetorically, Hemādri is explicit that the passage we have just 
examined is to be treated as the benchmark against which all other statements about yogins 
must be tested and interpreted. As he writes, “therefore, by this [above statement], it is known 
that the entirety of the statements about yogins [in our text] have precisely the subject of yatis 
who are endowed with these characteristics.”1391 And thus, after treating such topics as the 
importance of seeking out and inviting to the feeding lines after the śrāddha Brāhmaṇas who 
are hungry and living in poverty, but are too proud and concerned about their reputation to 
seek out assistance, Hemādri concludes this topic, which is labelled under the heading “those 
outside the āśramas (āśramabāhyāḥ),” seemingly for both good and ill, by reasserting in no 
uncertain terms that certain categories of ascetics are to be summarily driven away from the 
śrāddha, as for example in this extract from the Brahmavaivarta which reads, “But the bald 
headed ones, those wearing dreadlocks, and clothed in red robes must be driven away from the 
1391Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Śrāddhakalpa, pg. 423: etena sarvāṇy api yogivacanāny etallakṣaṇānvitayativiṣayāṇy eveti vijñāyate / 
1546 
śrāddha.” Once again, his preferred authorities are collections of Purāṇic proof texts mostly 
drawn from Vaiṣṇava leaning sources, since these are the texts most likely to match up to his 
intended message, but these have been interspersed with clipped extracts from other, more 
Śaiva leaning Purāṇic sources that are not as self-evidently treating the same topic but that 
have been edited such a way so that the reader assumes doctrinal harmonization. 
The next thirty pages of the Śrāddhakalpa are devoted to two deeply interconnected 
topics, a detailed catalog of the professional and religious identities who are not permitted a 
banner, and those viewed as “despoilers” of the purity of the śrāddha offering, and who are 
thus are not fit for the receiving lines. In the present context, we can barely do justice to the 
sociological richness of the resulting text’s representation of life-worlds of non-elite people in 
the medieval Deccan. Eschewing the usual stereotyped imagery we expect from kāvya, or 
antiquated formulas one finds in the Dharmaśāstra, Hemādri approaches the topic with a 
devotion to verisimilitude—making sure we know exactly who these people are and what they 
do—that previously in this study we have only seen in Someśvara III’s gadyakāvya, the 
Vikramāṅkābhyudaya. The key difference, of course, is that whereas the Cāḷukya king shared 
with us the social diversity of his kingdom because he believed it to be part of what made 
Kalyāṇa great, Hemādri’s intention is to ensure that professional Brāhmaṇa ritualists 
throughout the Seuṇa kingdom have all the tools they need to weed out unwanted classes of 
people. The particularity and the sheer variety of the social world that Caturvargacintāmaṇi 
sets out to domesticate blows open our comfortable presumptions about what medieval India 
must have been like. Thus, in the lesser manner of those forbidden a banner (ketanānarhāḥ), 
to cite just a few example (pg. 477–79) the ranks include devalakas—as Hemādri explains, 
1547these are those who worship deities for the sake of obtaining money1392—as well hypocrites 
(dambhikās), which Hemādri tells us is a technical term for those who observe restrictive 
injunctions (niyama) that cannot possibly ever yield results.1393 Our text mentions transgender 
people and soma sellers—as Hemādri specifies, the latter are those who sell the soma vine.1394 
It singles out various different subclasses of bards that attend a royal court, subdivided into 
such categories as the bodhakas, who are vaitālikas, and the caraṇas, who keep the company 
of female dancers called plavakas. Apparently there was a recognizable class of people who 
taught Śūdras Sanskrit śāstra, again with a special subcategory for those who specialized in 
teaching Śūdras Sanskrit grammar, and there were also those who taught śāstra to those who 
would end up teaching Śūdras.1395 Hemādri mentions several sorts of those who, for all intents 
and purposes, ascend in caste by marrying up, again with a special category for those who 
marry the daughters of Brāhmaṇas.1396 He speaks of those who cast out pretas for a fee, 
apparently called mṛtaniryyātakas, figures whose inclusion in the ranks of those who do not 
get a banner but are not despoilers of the line apparently differentiates them as somewhat less 
despised than several other categories of exorcists who appear in the other section.1397 Our 
author lists several different subcategories of financial debtors and the indebted, including 
those who charge exorbitant interest1398 as well as the so called “debt maker,” “one who obtains

a debt for the purpose of producing ‘unnecessary income.’”1399 People who make arrows sit 
alongside Brāhmaṇas who never even observe their rituals, who in turn are lumped next to the 
foreigners (yavanas).1400 
One of Hemādri’s longer and rather revealing discussions, for it is very suggestive of a 
new kind of state coming to terms with documenting and cataloging the population, involves 
the different subcategories of “people who have not been previously recognized.”1401 As our 
author explains, these are people who either themselves or even their ancestors are not 
mentioned in recorded sources, along with those whose foundational line are only listed in 
relation to a gaṇa or a saṅgha, archaic terms that may well still point to the survival of vestigial 
pre-monarchical modes of governance into the thirteenth century. As will be clarified in the 
next division, on those who “despoil the line,” one sub-type of people who descend from a 
gaṇa are in fact Śrauta ritualists who apparently remain within their own communities all their 
lives, having no further ties with the rest of society, a social arrangement that Hemādri treats 
as just as bad as being nāstika. 
When it comes to the ranks of those who “despoil the line,” Hemādri synthesizes 
together a range of different sources, each of which on its own privileges different criteria for 
determining exclusion from ritual settings. While many of these, probably the oldest 
restrictions, relate to having physical disabilities, sickness, or injuries, or entail Brāhmaṇas 
who violate the norms of their caste, a whole of host of them are much more eclectic and speak

immediately to our concerns in this chapter.1402 Encompassing at once concerns we would label 
as legal, purely “economic,” the regulation of professions, and the policing of social behavior, 
Hemādri’s approach to ritual governmentality amounts to a series of interrelated approaches 
for regulating different modes of transactionality and exchange. Part of the point here is that 
someone like a usurer, a counterfeit or a gambler, a defrauder of the village, someone who 
1402 It is these elements that are privileged in the following samplings from Hemādri’s enumeration. “These ones are not worthy of the line: [In response to Uśanas]. . . . Someone is usurer who subsists by the increase of interest with regard to a certain means of livelihood. . . . A merchant is someone who subsists by the transactions of selling and buying. . . .

One who subsists by śilpa is a one who has the livelihood of the construction of houses and temples. . . . A samprayoktṛ means one who gambles; however, a kitava in particular is one who cheats at dice. . . . A hypocrite is one who practices dharma on the pretext for the sake of pleasing the world. . . . 
[In response to Manu,] A preṣya is one who is doing the command of a king or village council. . . . The cow protector is the one who protects cows for the sake of subsistence. . . . But a contract laborer (bhṛtaka) is someone who takes wages according to the speech, “I will do this for so much money”. . . . A grinder of oils and so forth is a tailaka. A kūṭakāraka is someone who speaks non-truth in the court while acting as witness. Otherwise, the term refers to the act of the falsification of impressed coins and so forth. As for the mad or ones whose minds are unsteady, [this can be] on account of flaws of the vāta and so forth, or because of being seized by piśācas and so forth. . . . A gṛhasaṃveśaka is one who subsists on the discipline of vāstu, such a sthapitas and sūtradhāras and so forth. . . . A klība is someone of whom the “excitement has been broken off” in regard to “duties that have to be done.” “One who is always asking” is someone who always irritates the world by asking all the time. Here, the ka suffix is used in the original sense to indicate blameworthiness and so forth. . . . Aurābhrikas are those of whom the vendible items are rams or sheep; thus is also the case with the [seller] of buffalos. . . . The pretaniryāpaka is one who, for a price, casts out or conveys away pretas. The one who has a reviled ācāra is one of whom the social practice is censured. The ajapāla, a goat herder, is someone who protects goats for the sake of subsistence. As for the grāmakūṭaka he is someone who cheats the village. The sense is he causes to be consumed the wealth of the village by many sorts of fraudulent businesses. But a tulākūṭa, scale fraud, is a deceiver [who operates] by means of having a business that uses fraudulent scales.

manipulates the scales, which is to say someone who cheats the system “economically,” finds 
their immediate counterpart in the realm of religious life in the hypocrite “who practices 
dharma on a pretext for the sake of pleasing the world,” which is, of course a near paraphrase 
of the more conservative Mantramārga position about why one should continue to observe 
worldly dharma, and in the domestic world in a married man who is impotent. By defying the 
role assigned to them by the order of things, all of them are effectively committing fraud in 
precisely the same manner. Hemādri is equally keen on targeting professions and ways of life 
that step over and outside of his vision of a singular shared social normativity, in a large part 
because they represent autonomous sites of power and agency. Poison sellers and alchemists 
belong alongside exorcists for hire in that they offer or manipulate power substances on behalf 
of anyone of means as a paid service. People with “deviant” ācāras as well as preṣyas, the 
designated voices of the village council and the state, are problematic because they represent 
the older pluralistic paradigm Hemādri seeks to displace. Just like travelling troupes of 
performers, and nomads who wander in and out of urban and village areas selling the products 
from their cows, goats, and buffalo, contract labor exists outside of permanent social relations 
governed by logics of uninterrupted dependency. In other words, literally in the first case but 
figuratively in the second, these are people who do not “know their place” within the social 
order and who spend much of their time effectively not subject to a singular and consistent 
guiding authority. 
Finally, there are ritually indispensable but low status communities like the oil pressers 
and the oil vendors, who, we should remember, figure frequently in the early medieval 
Kannada inscriptional record especially as both the patrons and recipients of usually small- 
scale grants affiliated with a temple complex. As we have seen repeatedly throughout this 
1551 
study, many of these demographics who are to be shunned, “service classes,” musicians and 
performers, artisans, healers and exorcists, nomads, as well as oil makers, also tend to have 
cultural and initiatory ties with Mantramārga ritual practitioners and “specialized” institutions. 
That being said, it is difficult to say whether it is the internal logic that animates these life- 
worlds themselves or their doctrinal allegiances that would have proven the bigger point of 
contention, for both represent value systems that are effectively antithetical to Hemādri’s 
interpretive project and for precisely the same sort of reasons. 
As you may have noticed, among the ranks of those who despoil the line, Hemādri has 
already incorporated śilpins as well as more general contractor builders (gṛhasaṃveśaka). This 
portion of our text is not organized thematically but is structured around Hemādri’s responses 
to a range of proof texts that themselves often simply enumerate different classes of rejected 
persons in accordance with the exigencies of meter as opposed to with the aim of cataloging 
examples according to coherent principles. Even so, more so than with any other demographic, 
Hemādri choses to return again and again to tackling comprehensively all the possible different 
terms of art that might be used to refer to the different groupings of artisans, focusing especially 
on goldmakers, with the express purpose of making sure that none of them slip through the 
cracks of his attempts at excluding them from commensality. 
[In response to the Yamasmṛti], śreṇīs are original inhabitants (prakṛti) [of a village] such as goldmakers and so forth. The sacrificer on behalf them is called a śreṇī sacrificer. One who subsists by attaining an increase in his store of gold through [the practice of] art is kalopajīva. He is one who makes a livelihood by means of art such as fashioning gold and so forth. Or, he is someone who lives by the sixty-four arts. One who is a great offender is a person of whom punishment has been done by the king, through the marking of the feet and so forth; he is [also] said to be a “punishment banner.” A honey killer is one who kills honey bees for the purpose of taking their honey. . . . Samayas are differential [legal] arrangements made by a king and so forth. . . .1403 A sacrificer of the pūga: a pūga is a collectivity of people who have the same

occupation, who are also of the same caste. One who is a sacrificer of that pūga is a pūga sacrificer. . . .1404A bhṛtya-teacher is one who has taught hired laborers or who is a teacher of hired laborers. Thus also [he] is a Śūdra-teacher. . . .1405 
One who subsists by the activity of writing books is a paustika. Or, a book writer may be one who sells books for money. A storyteller is one who is a teller of stories, such as the Bṛhadkathā, for the delight of the court parasite (vīṭa). A machine maker is someone who constructs machines for the sake of an assembly in forts and so forth, or for the sake of hunting. A kāṇḍapṛṣṭha is someone who subsists on weapon craft. . . . One who is vāditram plays a musical instrument that is struck. Nṛtya means one who dances. Gītā is song. Tāla rhythms are [dancing rhythms] such as cañcatpūta and so forth. The focus is one who subsists by his skill at these vidyās. A mūlyasāṃvatsarika is someone who points out the constellations and so forth out of his desire to obtain money. 
As is stated by Manu: “One should not speak the tithi of another person, or one should not point out the nakṣatras.” A great traveler is someone who travels on the ocean or is always going on the road. The aśmakuṭṭaka is a fashioner of stone for the purpose of building temples and so forth. . . .1406 
In much the same way that the Pratiṣṭhāpaddhati sets out to dismantle piece by piece 
the ritual systems and ethos that animated the professional lives of the makers of the world, 
here in the Śrāddhakalpa, the Caturvargacintāmaṇi sets about to disassemble the variety of 
social and juridical forms that made possible their largely autonomous way of life. In doing so, 
our text provides welcome confirmation that the social realities on ground in the Maharashtra

of his day that Hemādri sets about regulating out of existence bear a close affinity to those that 
we saw outlined in chapter three in Varadarāja’s Vyahāranirṇaya, right down to the use of 
parallel terms of art. The world of the arts and artisans, in other words, was comprehensively 
ordered around the differential arrangement of the law (vyavasthā) as established by kings and 
other ruling authorities, which gave sanction to samaya codes of differentiated law. This in 
turn enabled social forms like the pūga, self-governing collectivities in which people of single 
profession share a single caste background, but also created spaces for a myriad of types of 
non-Brāhmaṇa religious and technical authorities, such a mathematicians and astrologers, who 
were responsible for the ritual lives of these communities and who also provided various forms 
of mass education, both in technical disciplines and in the realm of cultural production. 
Particularly in light of the almost normative historiographical assumptions that the 
Brāhmaṇa as landlord-farmer was one of the defining pillars of a perennial Brāhmaṇa led social 
order often characterized as “feudal,” the amount of attention that Hemādri invests in 
delegitimizing this practice is also worthy of mention. Since the age that they live in does not 
entail the adoption of the dharmas associated with a time of trials, any involvement in 
agriculture, we are told, renders a Brāhmaṇa ineligible as a ritual participant, with an important 
stipulation. Overriding the context-specific legal pluralism we have encountered so often, the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi offers a universal injunction governing all agricultural production that 
removes the practical equivalent of ritual fault. Presumably taken out of a single year’s harvest, 
the producer is to give 1/6 of his yield to the king, 1/20 to the gods, and 1/18 to Brāhmaṇas, 
and so long as he does so, his transgressions will not be punished. This arrangement at once 
points to the preexistence of a substantial number of caste inappropriate tenant farmers who 
have to somehow be accommodated as well as alternative financial means whereby Brāhmaṇas 
1554 
who are not themselves farmers can passively accrue income from the land merely by agreeing 
to overlook the transgressions of their neighbors. At the same time, much like we saw in the 
inscription from Unkeshwar,1407 it points to a new consensus that all modes of production 
should both directly enrich the state and help to fund the state supported project of reimagining 
the religious landscape, regardless of whether the “donees” themselves have any devotional, 
social, or personal ties to the religious institutions in question. 
With the multitudes of people who merely despoil the line dispensed with, the worst of 
the worst—those who must be violently driven away if they even approach the area where a 
śrāddha is taking place are reserved for last. In contrast to what we have seen up until now, 
this category is defined explicitly in doctrinal and theological terms. 
As described by Hemādri, of good intellect, whose jocular conversation is an ocean of nectar, a veritable sun whose radiance is wisdom, who is a lovely treasury of discrimination of truth from falsity, who is the king of the waves of compassion, the highest gold mine of auspiciousness—hear now the ones who have come forth from bad living creatures, who are to be driven away from the ground in the vicinity of the śrāddha [sacrifice]. . . .1408 
As is stated in the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa: Naked people and so forth should not ever see the śrāddha. . . . 
H: Naked (nagna) means those who have abandoned the Vedas. By the word ādi (“and so forth”) are understood those who have renounced the practice of Vedic ritual of those sorts. And likewise, on that very subject it is stated: 
“Since the three Vedas is the covering of all beings, those indeed who abandon it, out 
of delusion, are known indeed as the naked.” 
H: The “three” means the Veda. Saṃvaraṇa means covering or garment. For just as a garment protects people from cold, wind and so forth, in the same way, the Vedas also 
1407This was discussed in the beginning of the present chapter. 1408All of the following passages are from the apāsanīyanirūpaprakaṇa, the seventh ādhyāya of the Śrāddhakalpa within the CVC, which begins on pg. 515. Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Śrāddhakalpa: puṇyānāṃ paramākareṇa kar[u]ṇākallolinībhūbhṛtā / tattvātattvavicāracārunidhinā prajñāprabhābhāsvatā / narmālāpasudhārṇavena sudhiyā hemādriṇā varṇyate / śrāddhāsannabhuvo ‘paneyam adhunā duṣprāṇijātaṃ tv iha // 
1555 
protects from suffering in that it establishes the practice of one’s own dharma. Thus, it is similar to a garment. 
“Those who follow the dharmas of the Buddhists, Śrāvakas, the Text-less, Śāktas, Jīvakas, Kāpilas are indeed folks that are naked.” 
H: Buddhists means Buddhists (saugata), Śrāvakas means Śvetāmbara Jains. The Text- less are the Digambara Jains. Śāktas are Kaulas. Jīvakas are Bārhaspatyas—the sense is the Cārvākas. Kapila is one who resides in the Lokāyata country. Kāpilas are those who are led by him.1409 
In the root text on which Hemādri’s is relying, the people who are to be completely 
forbidden fall under the category of “the naked” (nagna). In the original source, this is likely 
a mundane pragmatic restriction. We are probably simply talking about people who do not 
wear any clothes, who must put clothes on before attending the ritual. And yet, through 
intertextual exegesis, Hemādri is able to shape this passage into something that provides a 
capstone to this part of his interpretive project. In this regard he clearly again is leaning on a 
specifically Vaiṣṇava precedent, for all of the sources that offer this somewhat fanciful 
allegorical reading of the term nagna seem to originate in such a domain.1410 What our author 
1409Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Śrāddhakalpa, pg. 519–520: brahmāṇḍapurāṇe— nagnādayo na paśyeyuḥ śrāddham etat kadācana. . . . H: nagnāḥ vedaparityāginaḥ / ādiśabdena tatprakārā vaidikakarmānuṣṭhānatyāgino gṛhyante / tathā ca tatraivoktam / sarveṣām eva bhūtānām trayī saṃvaraṇaṃ yataḥ / ya vai tyajanti tāṃ mohāt te vai nagnā iti smṛtāḥ / H: trayī vedaḥ, saṃvaraṇaṃ prāvaraṇaṃ yathā pravaraṇaṃ sītavātādibhyaḥ puruṣāṃs trāyate evaṃ trayy api svadharmān anuṣṭhāpayantī duḥkhebhyaḥ trāyata iti prāvaraṇasādṛśyam / bauddhaśrāvakanirgranthaśāktajīvakakāpilān / ye dharmān anuvarttante te vai nagnādayo janāḥ / H: bauddhāḥ saugatāḥ / śrāvakāḥ śvetapaṭāḥ / nirgranthāḥ jaināḥ / śākta kaulāḥ / jīvakāḥ [b]ārhaspatyāḥ cārvākā iti yāvat / kapilaḥ lokāyatikadeśīyaḥ tena praṇītāḥ kāpilāḥ / 1410 The source of this argument and the rhetoric of the Vedas as a covering (saṃvaraṇa) seems to be the Viṣṇu Purāṇa, where it appears twice in this context in the seventeenth and eighteenth chapters of the third division of the text. In both cases what is being presented is a theistic Purāṇic appropriation of Dharmaśāstra norms of a sort that will only substantively penetrate the genre of Dharmaśāstra with the advent of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi itself. See especially Viṣṇu Purāṇa 3.17.4–6: ko nagnaḥ kiṃsamācāro nagnasaṃjñāṃ naro labhet/nagnasvarūpam icchāmi yathāvat gaditaṃ tvayā // parāśara uvāca: ṛgyajuḥsāmasaṃjñeyaṃ trayī varṇāvṛtir dvija / etām ujjhati yo mohāt sa nagnaḥ pātakī smṛtaḥ // trayī samastavarṇānāṃ dvija saṃvaraṇaṃ yataḥ / nagno bhavaty ujjhitāyām atas tasyām asaṃśayam // Also of relevance is Viṣṇu Purāṇa 3.18.34–36: tato devāsuraṃ yuddhaṃ punar evābhavad dvija / hatāś ca te ‘surā devaiḥ sanmārgaparipanthinaḥ // saddharmakavacas teṣām abhūd yaḥ prathamaṃ dvija / tena rakṣābhavat pūrvaṃ neśur naṣṭe ca tatra te // tato maitreya tanmārga-vartino ye ‘bhavañ janāḥ / nagnās te tair yatas tyaktaṃ trayīsaṃvaraṇaṃ vṛthā // The Viṣṇu Purāṇa, however, offers an exclusively Vaiṣṇava interpretive project and has no use for the core logic of the universal dharma that animates the CVC. 
1556 
has done in a sense is that, without invoking Vaiṣṇava signifiers or making plain that this idea 
is product of interreligious polemic, he has taken entextualized Vaiṣṇava specific norms and 
theological frameworks and equated them with the shared worldview of a new kind of Smārtas. 
Indeed, as Hemādri explains in his commentary, the function of the Veda is not that it provides 
the core conceptual resources for this new tradition, but rather that it “protects from suffering” 
by “establishing the practice of one’s own dharma (svadharma).” In other words, its main 
virtue is that it provides checks that seek to override a pluralism of values and a pluralism in 
law. For Hemādri, the figures that most thoroughly embody such abhorrent normativities are 
not the agents of the Mantramārga as whole, but a curious rouges gallery of what we would 
call Śramaṇa religions—Buddhists, Śvetāmbara and Digambara Jains, the survivors of the old 
materialisms, along with what this study has taken to be our author’s main intended opponents, 
the Śāktas, whom Hemādri quite accurately identifies as Kaulas. Intriguingly, by and large, 
one of the defining features of the heterodoxy of all of these communities is that, in addition 
to being socially dependent for their survival on a site- and community-specific differentiation 
of norms, at least by this time period, they have adopted nominalist-like epistemologies that 
treat individual things and “experience” as sources of authority. In essence then, whether or 
not such agents themselves adhere to the expected norms of Varṇāśramadharma, they 
represent everything written on the slate that is our particularized world that the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi seeks to wipe clean away. This section then concludes with a series of 
warnings, emphasizing once again that in a world where legal and moral judgements are both 
normative and universal, there exist no exceptions to universalized ritual and legal norms, even 
for the ruling powers. Perhaps most pertinently, Hemādri directs his readers to the following 
seemingly cursory statement: 
1557And this is the prohibition regarding the eating of rice of a king who has deviated from his own dharma. Thus is to be seen: “The food is never to be eaten of kings who are devoid of protecting the people, who are deviating from the law books. One who is eating it should go to hell.”1411 
Given what we have learned about the dominant normativities that animate the 
medieval Deccan, and which continued to hold sway in places where the Seuṇas did not rule 
and the Caturvargacintāmaṇi had not been embraced as the law of the land, if taken seriously, 
this small statement amounts to the shattering of any hopes of commensality between the 
Seuṇas and other royal courts. This is not the place to engage with the rather substantial 
multilingual corpus of texts and documentary records produced in the courts of the Seuṇa’s 
major regional rivals, the Hoysalas to the east in Karnataka and the Solaṅkī Caḷukyas of 
Gujarat, but suffice it to say that in both domains, but especially among the Hoysalas and their 
vassals, right alongside an increasingly influential and decidedly Vaiṣṇava normativity, 
Kalyāṇi Caḷukya social “best practices,” including the use of non-Brāhmaṇa ācāryas 
overseeing artisans in construction and the initiation of generals and sometimes the kings 
themselves into Śākta samaya codes continued into the fourteenth century. Were they actually 
to follow the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, even to parley or arrange and celebrate a marriage, the 
Seuṇas would have no longer been willing to share the food and trust of their relatives and 
rivals. Succinctly, the program of social reform that the Caturvargacintāmaṇi promotes in 
almost every aspect aims not at the restoration of long held social norms but at a revolution in 
1411 The remark in question is supplied by Hemādri in the context of commenting on an extended passage assigned to the Hārītasmṛti that is mostly dedicated to discussing the impropriety of consuming the food of the gaṇas and gaṇikās but that at no point offers any rules governing the behavior of other kinds of elite social agents, let alone kings, and it seems to represent authorial innovation. Hemādri ascribes later portions in his discourse to the rather obscure and apparently lost Chāgaleyasmṛti. Hemādri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Śrāddhakalpa, pg. 782: ayaṃ ca svadharmavyapetasya rājño ’nnabhojane pratiṣedha iti draṣṭavyam / “prajāpālanahīnānāṃ rājñām ucchāstravarttinām / annaṃ na jātu bhoktavyaṃ bhuñjāno rauravaṃ vrajet //” iti chāgaleyasmaraṇāt / 
1558 
the practice and understanding of dharma that irrevocably breaks away from an almost 
thousand-year consensus. 
In preparation for our upcoming encounter with Hemādri’s vision as a theologian, it is 
worth considering some the sources that have inspired this drastic break from the familiar. As 
we will see in our final chapter, though Hemādri’s universal dharma is profoundly influenced 
by a range of Vaiṣṇava scriptures, no single work has more an impact than the Bhāgavata 
Purāṇa, and this true even in regard to the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, where it is quoted sparingly. 
It is thus fitting that we close out our own exploration of the disciplinary dimensions of 
Hemādri’s interpretive project, especially as they pertain to the “curation” of individual 
participation upon the sacrificial grounds, by turning to the Bhāgavata’s own reflections upon 
such matters, which until now have been entirely overlooked by modern Western scholarship. 
The fourth division of the Bhāgavata Purāṇa1412 begins with a retelling of the story of 
the destruction of Dakṣa’s sacrifice, a tale that for many contemporary Śaivas in the thirteenth 
century was emblematic of both the demographic inclusivism of their tradition as well as of 
the necessity of ferociously defending the honor of their god.1413 Needless to say, the 
Bhāgavata construes this story in a rather different manner. Succinctly, as we are about to see, 
it will reimagine this story as a charter myth justifying the exclusion of initiated Śaivas from 
social life and the sacrificial grounds. 
1412The story of the Dakṣa’s sacrifice and its aftermath occupies most of Bhāgavata Purāṇa 4.2–4.7. 1413An important point of reference here is the multilingual discourse of the twelfth- to fourteenth-century Vīramāheśvaras, which connects the story of Dakṣa’s sacrifice with their community’s practice of gaṇācāra, which will be inherited by more familiar Vīraśaiva traditions. The Viramāheśvaras in turn seem to be drawing on older systems of social normativity aligned with the Kālamukhas and Bhairavasiddhānta mandating that those who criticize the godhead from outside the community forfeit their lives. For more of this important topic, see the forthcoming monograph of Elaine Fisher. 
1559 
At first things proceed in the usual fashion, with Dakṣa denouncing his daughter Satī’s 
relationship with the ill-mannered skull wearing lord who dwells in the cremation grounds.1414 
In a pointed language that resonates with the rhetoric of the text we have just read, Dakṣa 
laments that by Śiva and his followers the path (panthā) practiced by good people (sadbhir) 
had been defiled (dūṣita). Though Śiva took his daughter’s hand in marriage in front of sacred 
fire in the presence of Brāhmaṇas (viprāgnimukhataḥ) as if he was a good person (iva 
sādhuvat), from Dakṣa’s perspective, at least, the god failed to do his father-in-law proper 
homage after the marriage. For this reason, his new father-in-law has come to resent him 
immensely, lamenting that bestowing his daughter in marriage was “like [giving] beautiful 
speech to a śūdra (śūdrāyevośatīṃ giram).” Dakṣa then continues on in the usual fashion, 
denouncing the impurity and inauspiciousness of the so-called auspicious lord, as well as his 
motley filthy retinue of followers, until at last he declares that there is going to be implemented 
a new restrictive injunction (niṣidhyamānaḥ). Henceforth, in the Vedic sacrifice, the god Bhava 
will no longer receive any offering whatsoever. This far, the story is indistinguishable from 
any of its other tellings. Of course, by end of the tale, Śiva’s rightful share will be restored to 
him and we will be taught that Śiva and Viṣṇu are one and the same supreme principle and 
neither is to be disrespected.

(Delhi: Chowkamba, 2011).

Then, suddenly and unexpectedly, the Bhāgavata swerves off onto a very different 
course that aims at conveying a contrarian message. To accomplish this task, in a subplot 
leading up to the actual performance of Dakṣa’s sacrifice, it introduces into the story two new 
protagonists, who usually play no meaningful role in the myth. The first of these figures is 
none other than Nandikeśvara, the leader of Śiva’s gaṇas and the revealer of the 
Śivadharmaśāstra. The second is the Vedic sage Bhṛgu, forefather of the often-ferocious line 
of the warrior Brāhmaṇa Bhārgavas. What happens next, according to the Bhāgavata, is that 
Nandīkeśvara makes a mistake. Defiled by the garment that is anger (roṣakaṣāyadūṣitaḥ), he 
places a curse on the head of Dakṣa and his followers.1415 Dakṣa, he declares, entrapped by the 
net of karma, will have his mind turned away from the Vedic dharma. Because he acted like a 
beast (paśu), that clever one will become goat -aced (bastamukhaḥ) and will become obsessed 
with desire for women. Dakṣa and his followers, the gaṇeśvara proclaims, will be reborn again 
and again in this world. Directing his attention to Dakṣa’s Brāhmaṇa followers, Nandikeśvara 
proclaims: May those haters of Hara whose selves are agitated be deluded by the abundant kindling wood that is the sweet smell of the flowery scriptural language! For the sake of their livelihood [and not out of piety] may the twice-borns eat everything, bear vows, austerity, and wisdom here in this world! May they be beggars for whom the [only] wealth is the pleasure gardens of the bodily senses.1416 
As the Bhāgavata teaches, while Nandikeśvara was well within his rights in cursing 
the misguided Dakṣa, in directing his ire to his Brāhmaṇa followers the lord of the gaṇas made 
1415Bhāgavata Purāṇa 4.2.20–26: vijñāya śāpaṃ giriśānugāgraṇīr nandīśvaro roṣakaṣāyadūṣitaḥ / dakṣāya śāpaṃ visasarja dāruṇaṃ ye cānvamodaṃs tadavācyatāṃ dvijāḥ // ya etan martyam uddiśya bhagavaty apratidruhi / druhyaty ajñaḥ pṛthagdṛṣṭis tattvato vimukho bhavet // gṛheṣu kūṭadharmeṣu sakto grāmyasukhecchayā / karmatantraṃ vitanute vedavādavipannadhīḥ // buddhyā parābhidhyāyinyā vismṛtātmagatiḥ paśuḥ / strīkāmaḥ so ‘stv atitarāṃ dakṣo bastamukho ‘cirāt // vidyābuddhir avidyāyāṃ karmamayyām asau jaḍaḥ / saṃsarantv iha ye cāmum anu śarvāvamāninam // giraḥ śrutāyāḥ puṣpiṇyā madhu-gandhena bhūriṇā / mathnā conmathitātmānaḥ sammuhyantu hara-dviṣaḥ // sarva-bhakṣā dvijā vṛttyai dhṛtavidyātapovratāḥ / vitta- dehendriyārāmā yācakā vicarantv iha // 
1561 
a pivotal mistake with long lasting repercussions. In defense of the Brāhmaṇas, Bhṛgu now 
steps forward and offers his own counter curse. 
These ones who bear vows to Bhava, and those ones who are entirely attached to them—may they be heretics, obstructing the true śāstra! Their purity destroyed, their minds deluded, bearing bones, ash, and matted locks, may they enter into Śaiva initiation (śivadīkṣāyāṃ) in which liquor is divine. Since you all blaspheme against Brahmā and the Brāhmaṇas, who are the bridge that is the support of men, thus, you have taken recourse to heresy! For this alone is the auspicious (śiva) eternal path of all the worlds/people (lokānāṃ), which previously they followed, of which the veridical authority (pramāṇa) is Janārdana. Having reviled that brahman, the Supreme, Pure [one], eternal, the abode of the good, go to heresy (pāṣaṇḍa), where your divinity is king of bhūtas!1417 
In this manner, the Bhāgavata condemns to the darkness the knowledge system of the 
Mantramārga and all its followers, not because they “disrupted” the sacrifice, but because they 
had the audacity to criticize Brāhmaṇas. The message here quite simply is śivadīkṣā is the 
foremost sign of heresy and that it is inextricably linked with transgressive practices. As the 
story progresses, Śiva himself and his worship, provided it is part of a multifaceted system of 
practice addressing other non Śaiva gods, will be redeemed. And though he is humbled, his 
head replaced with that of a goat, Bhṛgu’s curse is never lifted nor does the text ever condemn 
it. Indeed, it subtly asserts that it has established a new status quo where those who exclusively 
worship Śiva and imitate his actions are rendered radically impure and forever more unfit to 
participate in society. The story resumes in the usual fashion, with Satī denouncing her father 
and committing ritual suicide and an enraged Vīrabhadra, acting on behalf of Śiva and 
accompanied by his gaṇas, descending upon Dakṣa’s sacrifice and destroying it. In order to 
appease the frenzied throng of Śaiva devotees, Brahmā and the other goods seek out lord Śiva 
1417Bhāgavata Purāṇa 4.2.28–32: bhavavratadharā ye ca tān samanuvratāḥ / pāṣaṇḍinas te bhavantu sacchāstraparipanthinaḥ // naṣṭaśaucā mūḍhadhiyo jaṭābhasmāsthidhāriṇaḥ / viśantu śivadīkṣāyāṃ yatra daivaṃ surāsavam // brahma ca brāhmaṇāṃś caiva yad yūyaṃ parinindatha / setuṃ vidhāraṇaṃ puṃsām ataḥ pāṣaṇḍam āśritāḥ // eṣa eva hi lokānāṃ śivaḥ panthāḥ sanātanaḥ / yaṃ pūrve cānusantasthur yatpramāṇaṃ janārdanaḥ // tad brahma paramaṃ śuddhaṃ satāṃ vartma sanātanam / vigarhya yāta pāṣaṇḍaṃ daivaṃ vo yatra bhūtarāṭ // 
1562 
and ask him to intervene, promising that his rightful share in the sacrifice will be restored to 
him. The decapitated Dakṣa is given the head of a goat, at which point he realizes the essential 
truth that Brahmā, Śiva, and Viṣṇu are the same supreme power—in other words, the core 
theology that animates the Caturvargacintāmaṇi. Dakṣa proclaims that this supreme god’s role 
is to serve as the protector and corrector of Brāhmaṇas, and Śiva is pleased. Everyone then 
assembles to attend the “vaiṣṇava yajna,” which is to commence with an offering made to 
Viṣṇu in three vessels. First, however, in order to ensure both the sanctity and continuity of the 
interrupted rite, the malign influence of Śiva’s “disruptors”—the pramathagaṇas—must be 
expunged. As the text pointedly states, the puroḍaśa is performed “to purify [the sacrifice] 
from the touch (saṃsarga) of the vīras (vīrasaṃsargaśuddhaye).”1418 
Once this has been accomplished and the taint of the followers of the Mantramārga has 
been expunged, all at once—to the astonishment of the crowd—Viṣṇu makes himself manifest 
before the sacrifice. One by one, the gods and the sages begin to praise him, and of course Śiva 
is no exception. Strangely enough, however, the words that Śiva speaks are only incidentally 
addressed to his other half, for in reality, they target his followers. 
If some ignorant person promotes me [lit., repeats me] as having bad conduct (apaviddha)—I whose mind is fixed on your lotus feet, which, even though they [grant] all aims here in this world by means of [your] benediction, ought to be honored by dispassionate sages with respect—because of your supreme grace, I do not take that into account.1419 
1418Bhāgavata Purāṇa 4.7.16–17: kṣamāpyaivaṃ sa mīḍhvāṃsaṃ brahmaṇā cānumantritaḥ / karma santānayām āsa sopādhyāyartvigādibhiḥ // vaiṣṇavaṃ yajñasantatyai trikapālaṃ dvijottamāḥ / puroḍāśaṃ niravapan vīrasaṃsargaśuddhaye // As Śrīdhara, whose commentary postdates Hemādri’s floruit but whose glosses often mirror those offered by our author, understands things—the vīras are the pramathas, and the flaw that must be purified is their having made contact with the sacrifice so that their impact will cease to be active (vīrāṇāṃ pramathādīnāṃ saṃsargakṛtadoṣasya śuddhaye nivṛttayartham). 1419Bhāgavata Purāṇa 4.7.29: tava varada varāṅghrāv āśiṣehākhilārthe hy api munibhir asaktair ādareṇārhaṇīye / yadi racitadhiyaṃ māvidyaloko ‘paviddhaṃ japati na gaṇaye tat tvatparānugraheṇa // This verse has many syntactic odd features which Śrīdhara’s gloss conspicuously avoids acknowledging. When it comes to its lexical peculiarities, Śrīdhara’s commentary reads out of the verse a specific theological message somewhat in excess of the bare semantics in evidence, much of which is founded on his understanding of the term apaviddha as referring to deviant conduct. Nevertheless, numerous textual parallels from across a range of time periods and genres, 
1563 
Though these words are quite oblique, the core message is quite simple. Though some 
ignorant people may have disseminated (japati glossed by Śrīdhara as jalpati) the message that 
Śiva promotes a degraded mode of social praxis (ācārabhraṣṭam in Śrīdhara’s understanding 
of apaviddham), Śiva says, “I pay (gaṇaye) them no heed,” for in actuality Śiva himself clings 
to the grace of the supreme lord and repudiates such toxic nonsense. In other words, the price 
Śiva has paid for his own inclusion in respectable society is the exclusion of his most devout 
devotees. The gist of the matter is that Śiva is great, but Śaivism is not, and anyone who thinks 
otherwise needs to get with the program and start reading and following real śāstras. The 
Bhāgavata, for instance. Or, the Caturvargacintāmaṇi. . . . 
where the term is frequently glossed as pariduṣṭa or akṛtya, support the general contours of his construal. The reading of japati as standing in for jalpati is more eccentric. Note also that mā here is the rarely seen enclitic for the first personal pronoun and not a negation lacking a corresponding aorist.

Chapter 5: A Substantive Intervention: Reading the Material Culture of the Western 
Deccan Across Region and Dynasty 
More than one hundred miles from the Cāḷukya capital at Kalyana in the district of Bhoom, 
Osamanbad, lies a small village of scarcely ten thousand people. Despite its remoteness, it 
remains for certain caste communities an important site for pilgrimage, attracting devotees 
from as far away as Pune. Though in recent years the tradition has been emended to conform 
to the schedules of working people participating in a capitalist economy, it has long been 
customary that when a male child is born—on the sixth day he is alive—his parents would take 
him before Mother Sātwai, the goddess of the six. 
Sātwai Devī in situ on the side of Māṇakeśvara Temple. 
Sātwai Devī’s duties include inscribing the fate 
of the child upon on his forehead, a task she 
carries out on the midnight of his sixth day. 
Indeed, there seems to be some sense that 
through preemptive propitiation, the goddess of 
the sixth day can be coaxed into adopting a 
more magnanimous attitude in fixing a child’s 
destiny. For this reason, before a stone smeared 
in turmeric and vermillion, families come to 
Sātwai Devī with offerings of liquor, child size 
bangles, and, traditionally, a goat or chicken.

As the careful reader of Kiss of the Yogini has by now probably recognized, from the 
perspective of a historian of religion, the goddess Sātwai605 as found at the Māṇakeśvara temple 
in Bhoom represents a thinly veiled transposition of the pan-Indic goddess Ṣaṣṭhī, also 
primarily a goddess of childbirth, with whom our Devī even shares her name. Already 
described in the Mānavagṛhyasūtra, where she is identified with “Śrī, the great goddess of 
royal sovereignty,” as White aptly notes, Ṣaṣṭhī has been worshipped by “nearly every Hindu 
in India. . . since Kushan times” and thus “hers is no more a ‘folk’ cult than those of the great 
Goddesses Durgā or Lakṣmī.”606 So, in a general sense, Sātwai’s turning up somewhere within 
605Sātwai Devī is mentioned in passing in a number of ethnographies from the colonial period as well as in mid- twentieth-century district surveys, which are often among the best sources of information on the cultural practices of the Marathawada. Thus, in R.V. Russel’s four volume study, The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India, vol. 4, Sātwai Devī is discussed twice (pg. 31, 38) under the entry for the Kunbi people, where we learn: “On the sixth day after birth they believe that Chhathi or Satwai Devi, the Sixth-day Goddess, comes at midnight and writes on the child’s forehead its fate in life, which writing, it is said, may be seen on a man’s skill when the flesh has come off it after death. On this night the women of the family stay awake all night singing songs and eating sweetmeats. A picture of the goddess is drawn with turmeric and vermilion over the mother’s bed. The door of the birth-room is left open, and at midnight she comes. Sometimes a Sunār is employed to make a small image of Chhathi Devi, for which he is paid Rs.1-4 and it is hung round the child’s neck. On this day the mother is given to eat all kinds of grain, and among the flesh-eating castes the soup of fish and meat, because it is thought that every kind of food which the mother eats this day will be easily digested by the child throughout its life. On this day the mother is given a second bath, the first being on the day of the birth, and she must not bathe in between. Sometimes after childbirth a woman buys several bottles of liquor and has a bath in it; the stimulating effect of the spirit is supposed to remedy the distension of the body caused by the birth.” R.V. Russel, The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India, vol. 2 (London: Macmillan and Co., 1916), 31. 
In the first volume of The Castes and the Tribes of H.E.H. The Nizam’s Dominion, published in 1920, Syed Siraj- ul-Hassan tersely confirms that “on the fifth day after birth, Satwai, the guardian of infants, is worshiped with offerings of dentifrice and goods.” He associates this practice, however, not with the Kunbi, but rather with the Gondhali, the caste that performs the Gondhal rites that descend from the dances dedicated to Bhairava and the goddess, with the Koli, a fisherman caste, and with the Mali, who are roughly on par in status with the Kunbi as well as the Hāṭkar Dhangars, the latter of whom hold the highest status among the ninety-two sub-tribes of nomads. Syed Siraj-ul-Hassan, The Castes and the Tribes of the Nizam’s Dominion, vol 1. (Bombay: The Times Press, 1920), 235. 
In both of these ethnographic representations, unlike the circumstances we are discussing, however, all of the rituals under discussion are of a purely domestic character. We should note in passing that the rituals described by Russel especially correspond quite closely to Bāṇa’s discussion in the Kādambarī (as noted in White, Kiss of the Yoginī, 41), of the paintings made on the wall of “Queen Candrāpīḍa’s lying in chamber.” This is hardly surprising, for the Maharashtrian traditions surrounding Sātwai descends directly from the cult of the goddess Ṣaṣṭhī, which, as White has suggested, has already taken form under the Kuṣāṇas. 606David Gordon White, Kiss of the Yoginī: “Tantric Sex” in its South Asian Contexts (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003), 41.

the religious social imaginary of the rural Marathawada is hardly unexpected; her veneration 
is effectively part of a perennial religion. With such knowledge already in hand, when we ask, 
“where does this goddess come from” and “what is she doing here,” our task is not that of 
reconstructing intellectual genealogies. When we speak of “here,” what we are setting out to 
locate is not “the place of a cult within the culture.” Instead, we are posing a question much 
more like the ones asked by spatial geographers. If one carefully attends to the larger material 
context in which this particular image of the goddess of the sixth day is situated, it soon 
becomes evident that, for Sātwai, the “here” where she resides, rather incongruously, is on the 
side of an early medieval temple complex. 
Left side of Māṇakeśvara temple. The image today worshipped as Sātwai Devī is on the far left, marked by vermillion run-off. The garbhagṛha is under the dome. 
Under uncountable layers of vajralepa, this Sātwai almost certainly commenced her own life 
as a largely incidental decoration, most likely not even the focus of any sort of worship, 
embedded within a wider and distinctive religious field. Blurring the imagined lines between 
594 
“folk and elite religion,” between practices kept in the family and those exposed to a range of 
publics, the application of this particular religious imaginary at this particular place poses a 
different sort of puzzle. 
The village of Mankeshwar is named after a single rather spectacular temple,607 which, 
in the usual fashion, is understood by the local people as executed in the “Hemadpanti” style.608 
Apart from the fallen śikhara, which has been replaced by a dome and pinnacle from the 
Maratha period, the structure, though defaced in places, is mostly intact. Despite the assigned 
moniker, simply on stylistic grounds Māṇakeśvara is indisputably a product of Kalyāṇi 
Cāḷukya period workmanship. Fortuantely, new evidene, in the form of an unpublished 
inscription in old Marathi located inside Māṇakeśvara’s maṇḍapa puts any further doubts 
about provenance to rest.609 While both the condition of the text as well as the style of 
607Apart from brief mention in James Burgess and Henri Cousens, Revised Lists of Antiquarian Remains in the Bombay Presidency (Bombay: Government Central Press, 1897), 16, I know of three brief treatments, the best of which are in Marathi. The first, G. B. Deglurkar, Temple Architecture and Sculpture of Maharashtra (Nagpur: Nagpur University, 1974), contains practically the only relatively modern discussion of material culture in the region, identifies the temple but misrepresents its provenance and iconographic program. Recent work by my dear friends and colleagues the archeologist and cultural historian Saili Palande-Datar and Amol Bankar offers major improvements on Deglurkar’s work, but are intended for more popular audiences. See for instance Amol Bankar, “Māṇakeśvara yethīl Śivālayācā Paricaya,” Prasad May 2016: 24–27. Both Saili and I visited Māṇakeśvara together to on our second trip through the Marathawada on November 7, 2017. 608Rather ironically, as the present work will make plain, structures of all sorts in Maharashtra from the early medieval period are uniformly characterized as executed in the style of building ascribed to the thirteenth-century Brāhmaṇa polymath and chief minister of the Seuṇa Yādava kingdom, Hemādri. In this case, however, the association likely stems from material culture evidence that is slightly misconstrued. The published inscription from Māṇakeśvara, from which we learn the name of the temple, the original of which seems to have been lost or relocated, documents a renovation carried out by the Seuṇa Yādava king Siṅghaṇa II in 1224 CE. The king in question, who as we shall see was the last ruler of his line to participate in the transregional religious ecologies we have been exploring, immediately precedes Hemādri’s floruit, which begins under Siṅghaṇa’s son and successor, Kandharāya. As another unpublished inscription on site reads, as was transcribed some years ago by Brahmanand Deshpande (courtesy of Amol Bankar, unpublished): svasti sri saku 1147 sabhānu 2 nāma saṃvacchare māgha sudha 10 (3 akṣaras missing) svau svastistrī yādava ka- (4)lakamalakalikāvi (6 akṣaras missing) kāsabhāskara sri siṃghana (6 akṣaras missing) devaḥ / māṇakesvarī datta, akṣarakita (remainder too damaged to read). 609The inscription that follows was documented and transcribed by Amol Bankar and myself apparently for the first time, though rumors of the text’s existence have circulated for some time in epigraphical circles. Some of the photographs used in these efforts were taken by Saili Palande-Datar. In collaboration with my friend and colleague, the epigrapher and numismatician Amol Bankar of the Bharata Itihas Samsodhaka Mandal, we arrived at the following tentative reading. One hopes that Bankar will in the coming years improve upon these conjectures and publish a proper study of the inscription. 
595 
inscriptional shorthand in which it is composed pose many difficulties, the identity of the 
patron in question, “the great heir to the throne” (yuvarāva maṭhīṃ) is thankfully not among 
them. As the date and listed title make plain, this is a śāsana (sāsana) issued by the Cāḷukya 
crown prince Mallikārjuna, the eldest son of Vikramāditya VI. As his fate would have it, 
Mallkārjuna predeceased his exceptionally long-lived father and thus never assumed the 
throne. Perhaps the Cāḷukya emperor would have benefited from a visit to the goddess of the 
sixth day. 
This chapter sets out to show that, even when our intellectual focus is thinking with 
nuance about a mostly long departed medieval world, texts are not the only sources we have 
for reconstructing contexts. Indeed, when it comes to posing questions not about ideas

themselves, but about relations and interactions, or the play of meaning as it manifests within 
a lived multifunctional spaces and landscapes, sometimes texts are in fact the wrong sort of 
tools for our thinking. In this spirit, our present discussion offers three case studies in which 
textuality is largely decentered, as hermeneutics gives way to a phenomenology of space. To 
put the matter in simpler terms, we will be thinking about space, its impact on people and 
things, and how it can serve as a vehicle for instantiating values. Through taking space and not 
text as our context, like any other viewer, we are forced to confront what we tend to think of 
as isolated objects of knowledge or distinctive places as always already existing within a 
multitude of relations. 
Much as we saw in chapter two when we treated texts as material objects, the translation 
of protean ideas into delimited physical forms that come to us already supplied with particular 
affordances leads to a reassessment of the range of often transactional functions that particular 
spheres of meaning evoke in daily life. However, instead of thinking with texts, however 
utilitarian, our main focus will be material culture. The medieval Deccan is home to some of 
the most abundant and also the most poorly documented temple complexes and sculptural 
traditions on the subcontinent. Most of these have never been the subject of academic study 
within a Western context. Apart from texts, along with even more thoroughly neglected 
archaeological evidence, they make up virtually all of what survives of early medieval culture. 
Despite the fact that, as we will see momentarily, such things represent probably the largest 
and, in a certain fashion, most readily contextualizable archive that is largely the product of a 
Tantric social imaginary, in thinking through the history of pre-Islamic religious tradition, they 
have scarcely received more than a few footnotes. 
597As corrective to such tendencies, the present chapter offers three interrelated case 
studies. The first, with which we will continue in a moment, engages with the temple complex 
at Māṇakeśvara as an exemplum of how an unabashedly Tantric ritual complex is embedded 
in space in a manner that translates the types of epistemic values we have been exploring into 
the medium of stone. In the second, through chasing images Bhairavas closely linked with the 
perpetuation of royal power across the Deccan, we will see how iconographic transformations 
and spatial transpositions over the longue durée begin to suggest a very different story about 
the changing place of cremation ground culture within society. Finally, as prelude to chapter 
6, which will offer an insider’s perspective of how explicitly Śākta values animated the types 
of social agents who produced our surviving material culture, we will travel from the ruins of 
the Cāḷukya capital at Kalyāṇa to the workshops of one the artisan communities that made the 
material culture. 
Irreconcilable Images in Irresolvable Space: The Changing Cāḷukya Temple 
Though the hundreds of near life-size images that adorn the outside of Māṇakeśvara are 
exceptional in their execution as well as essentially undocumented, the temple’s most 
unexpected and noteworthy feature is far more inconspicuous. Indeed, captivated by the more 
vivid parts of Māṇakeśvara’s iconographic program, as you circumambulate the temple— 
perhaps in a counter-clockwise fashion—most likely you will miss them entirely. 
598 
Mankeśvara, Maharashtra: Seated images of goddesses encircle the entire circumference of the Māṇakeśvara temple. 
. 
Small, seated goddesses, bearing a range of accoutrements—encircle the entire circumference 
of the temple, all of them placed at about the level of a person’s thighs. Should you take the 
time and tally them up, they number sixty-four. In other words, despite initial appearances, 
Māṇakeśvara, a temple constructed at the express direction of the heir apparent to the Kalyāṇi 
Cāḷukya throne, is dedicated to the sixty-four (catuḥṣaṣṭiḥ) yoginīs.610 
610 For more on yoginīs in general, the reader is directed to the long discussion of such matters found at the end of chapter 4. On the yoginī temple as general phenomenon as well as the standard treatment of their distribution throughout the subcontinent, the definitive work is Vidya Dehejia, Yoginī Cult and Temples: A Tantric Tradition (New Delhi: National Museum, 1986). 
599 
In the scholarly imagination, we tend to 
envision this quintessential expression of 
Tantric material culture—the yoginī temple— 
as a distinctively hypethral and circular 
structure placed on top of hill at least on an 
elevated plane. At places like Jabalpur in 
Madhya Pradesh or Hirapur in Orissa, while 
the external walls of the temple are 
nondescript, once one crosses through the 
gateway into the temple, the visitor is 
virtually assailed by the visceral highly 
individuated renderings of yoginīs. These 
deities are installed all around the internal 
walls of the site, facing inward and with the 
intention of encircling a free-standing image 
of Bhairava, in most cases no longer extant. 
External wall of Māṇakeśvara: Baṭuka Bhairava and two female attendants. One is dancing, kapāla in hand. 
Thus, outside the Deccan, the more familiar instantiations of the yoginī temple instantly present 
themselves to the observer as hyper-differentiated spaces, utterly dissimilar from the common 
temple in both form and function. The absence of such structures in the southern Deccan has 
generally been taken as an indication that the worship of yoginīs, and with it the Śākta social 
imaginary, never really found a home in the region.611 Produced under royal patronage, at the 
611When discussing their geographical distribution Dehejia (pg. 77–83) takes a more moderate position, suggesting that absence of evidence is not strictly speaking evidence of absence. Outside of Srisailam and the Kōlāramma Temple on the border between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, precisely because she equates yoginī temples with hypetheral structures the only evidence she can find for the Deccan south of the Narmadā is ethnographic in character. Incidentally, though images at both sites have not survived, both Khidrapura near Kolhapur and an unnamed temple on site at the Seuṇa Yādava capital in Sinnar near Nasik are plausible candidates for hypetheral structures. 
600 
direction of the scion of the most influential ruler of his day outside the Tamil south, the temple 
at Māṇakeśvara offers a substantive rebuttal of such working assumptions. Indeed, when we 
reassess the material record, we find that that—while this sort of yoginī temple itself seem to 
be mostly a Maharashtrian feature, there is a virtually limitless canon of images and structures 
pointing toward a distinctly Deccani take on the Śākta past hiding in plain sight.

601 
At Māṇakeśvara, Bhairava and his consort Bhairavī occupy the place prescribed to 
them by scripture: the heart of the maṇḍala, encircled by sixty-four yoginīs. Indeed, the couple 
actually appear twice. First, expertly crafted images of the two deities are found on the exterior 
of the temple. At precisely the same point in the floorplan, respectively positioned on the left 
and right side of the temple, each is placed aligned with the other on the external wall of the 
threshold marking the entrance into the garbhagṛha. Additionally, albeit by a much less gifted 
hand, variations on the same images reoccur inside the temple, placed respectively on the right 
and left pillars flanking the entrance into the threshold-space before the garbhagṛha. 
Temple interior details: Baṭuka Bhairava and Bhairavī. 
As we shall soon see, the changing presentation of this iconographic program in lived space 
602 
has its own quite recoverable history intimately linked to the visual language assumed by the 
powerful in the Deccan by most political actors from at least the seventh century. What is 
distinctive about the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya approach is precisely that these temples embed their 
focuses of worship in the midst of a play of disparate images that carry with them a competing 
array of semiotic referentiality.612

Top Right: Piśāca with a curved knife in the middle of representations of Mahiṣāsuramardinī and Andhakāsuravadha. Bottom Left: Ascetics initiating a devotee. Bottom Right: woman with a mirror. 
612Indeed, as we shall see, these programs are often much more varied and multifaceted than what we find at Māṇakeśvara. 
603 
Left side of the Umāmaheśvara temple at Umapur near Kalyana. Bhairava is in the alcove. 
In considerable contrast, at the pre-twelfth-century Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya ritual center at 
Umapur in Bidar district, ten miles from the royal capital, this rich play of varied imagery is 
not yet in evidence. In its place, we find a structurally much simpler though quite elegant facade 
executed in a style somewhat reminiscent of that of the late Bādāmi Caḷukyas. The 
Umāmaheśvara Temple, which bears this name because it houses an image of Śiva and Parvatī 
604 
in place of the expected liṅga in its garbhagṛha, is much smaller in scale than Māṇakeśvara 
and almost entirely free from ornamentation and figurative iconography. In place of hundreds, 
only three figures adorn its outer walls, each of them positioned flanking the three exteriors 
that encircle the garbhagṛha, Unmistakably, two of these images are virtually identical to the 
representations of Bhairava and his consort as they appear several hundred years later in the 
interior of Māṇakeśvara right down to the gesture of the goddess raising her finger to her lips. 
Bhairava and Bhairavī from the left and right alcoves at Umapur. 
Yet if the images themselves are iconographically identical, the visual fields in which 
they are embedded foster very different sorts of impressions. The bare surfaces at Umapura, 
though imposing, impose no specific cognitive content in the mind of a visiting devotee. The 
exterior of the temple has only three visual focal points to which the design directs the eye. All 
three of the deities face outward towards the observer and each of them is positioned at exactly 
605 
the same height on the exterior of the temple. In this way, the worshipper is straightforwardly 
oriented, presumably to a program of pūjā centered around the veneration of three deities on 
the exterior as prelude to the worship of the central image of Umāmaheśvara. Though just ten 
miles from the palace, Umapur is situated on the outskirts of a network of religious centers 
linked to the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya capital and seemingly intended for specialized worship 
conducted by the kings. It is, in other words, a space conceived of with a single focused purpose 
and highly limited audience.

At Māṇakeśvara, in contrast, scarcely a surface is bare. Much like their counterparts in 
Europe, the Indian sculptor deployed a compositional strategy where each individual image 
606 
was not only framed in relation to architectural elements and the surrounding negative space 
but also with the intention that there was a single optimal place for the viewer to stand if the 
individual image was to have its intended impact. Indeed, in many cases approaching the image 
from other angles would present to the viewer a distorted image. What is so unnerving and 
intentionally overwhelming about a temple like Māṇakeśvara is that there is no perfect vantage 
point for viewing the temple as a whole. To align oneself as intended with one image is of 
necessity to become disaligned with many others. Like in a symphony by Schumann, though 
the melody is compelling, one is left waiting and waiting in vain for resolution—for that 
anticipated return to a tonic key that never ever comes. In short, the temple offers a visual 
idiom that resists and rejects the possibility of reduction to an essential element, form, or point 
of view. Temple exterior: Māṇakeśvara. 
In place of the outward facing images at Umapur, each offered in isolation and directly 
connecting to the viewer, at Māṇakeśvara, the eyes of images gaze upward, offer obeisance, 
607engage with the enemy, entice a partner, or cast at you a coquettish side long glance. We are 
forced to witness a play of technical perspective in which we are confronted in a single visual 
field by the presentation of multiple seemingly unconnected perspectives. Each image or 
grouping of image abides in its own reality. Each is attuned to a particular affective response. 
Thus, while this image of a mother cradling a nursing toddler who is tugging eagerly at her 
breasts and a skull-bearing guardian figure in concrete terms occupy adjacent physical spaces, 
they offer a jarring juxtaposition in terms of their affective space. 
Māṇakeśvara: Detail of exterior wall. 
608 
As you might have noticed, in this image, the plinth above the deity to the right of the 
nursing mother is crowned by a relief image of the śikhara of a simple single shrine temple in 
the nāgara style. Indeed, it is precisely the same sort of structure that adorns the top of the 
temple at Umapur. The great scholar of medieval Indian architecture Adam Hardy has offered 
a convincing explanation of the logic that animates these structural choices: 
For me the key is the aedicule, defined as an “image of a building used as a compositional element” (Glossary, 244). Much of Indian temple architecture is not merely “decorated” with the “small models of large buildings” observed by James Fergusson, but composed entirely of temple-images that appear at a whole range of scales. . . . Aedicules are not arbitrary assortments but representations of familiar shrine forms. . . from the matrix of temple walls. Underlining the fact that they are meaningful entities, these various kinds of shrine-image appear not only as primary components, but also at lower levels of the compositional hierarchy, as niches and so on. . . . In many traditions the relationships between the aedicular components of a temple design increasingly express movement. More than just “cascading,” interpenetrating forms emerge one from another in emanatory sequences. . . . 
Parallels and connections can be shown between temple forms and, on the one hand. . . religious and philosophical ideas. The congruencies between these realms are vastly more apparent once the aedicular structure of temple designs is recognized. For example, in terms of religion, the simple idea of one god with many aspects is made visible when one sees how their many abodes are linked into a heavenly palace. If a temple is an image of the unfolding universe, a symbol of divine and cosmic manifestations, the aedicules are its disaggregating units.613 
Hardy’s adept interpretation centered on the aedicule, an “image of a building used as 
a compositional element,” has considerable explanatory power, and yet it overlooks an 
important practical and conceptual dimension of a temple like Māṇakeśvara. For right 
alongside representing “an image of the unfolding universe,” the building block of which is 
the single free-standing shrine endlessly replicated in space, our temple also presents an 
unspecified quotidian domain, the sort of space where, without the elegant framing of nāgara

609 
śikhara, a young mother might pause momentarily—perhaps too long for the little one’s 
liking—and hold her own space before once again nursing her child. The peculiar genius of 
the Cāḷukya visual idiom is that for the first time, it allows for the mingling of such disparate 
sensibilities held in dynamic tension in shared but irresolvable space. 
Where is Bhairava? Or, The Changing Place of Power in the Deccan 
While the Imperial Guptas still ruled, however tentatively, in Vidiśa, far to their south in the 
district of Bagalkot—even before they attained their independence from the Kadambas—the 
Bādāmi Caḷukyas were already beginning to build temples.614 By the early fifth century, 
archaeological traces point to the existence of numerous structures made of bricks. Though 
little unambiguous evidence exists to take us beyond speculation, these were perhaps 
comparable to the virtually contemporary temples of Uttarēśvara and Trivikrama, each 
executed in a different style, that miraculously still stand in the town of Ter on the edge of the 
614There is a large but largely documentary literature historicizing the Bādāmi Caḷukyas and their temple culture, much of which is virtually interchangeable in terms of its quality and content. Here are offered both some representative works as well as a few of the more genuinely useful key texts. In terms of purely historical works, K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, A History of South India, From Prehistoric Times to the Fall of Vijayanagar (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1955) remains a good point of orientation. R. C. Rayachaudhuri, History of the Western Cālukyas: Part I The Early Cālukyas of Bādāmi (Calcutta: n.p., 1975) offers some useful updates. The first half of Durga Prasad Dikshit, Political History of the Chālukyas of Bādāmi (New Delhi: Abhinav Publications, 1980) and K. V. Ramesh, Chalukyas of Vātāpi (New Delhi: Agam Kala Prakashan, 1984) also has some value. In terms of the periodizing of material culture, the standard point of reference is Michael Meister and M. A. Dhaky, ed., Encyclopedia of Indian Temple Architecture: South India— Upper Drāviḍadēśa, Early Phase (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986). For Archeology, one might consult A. V. Narasimha Murthy, Excavations at Banavāsi (Mysore: Directorate of Archaeology & Museums, 1997) and for historiography, at least up to 1997, Gary Michael Tartakov, The Durga Temple at Aihole: A Historiographical Study (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997) is a good place to start. While the inscriptions of the Bādāmi Caḷukyas, scattered throughout the thirty-six volumes of Epigraphia Indica and South Indian Inscriptions, have been a central focus of study throughout the history of Indian epigraphy, and there are many useful discussions of individual texts, the casual reader can make do with consulting Shrinivas Padigar, Inscriptions of the Calukyas of Bādāmi (c. 543–757) (Bangalore: Indian Council of Historical Research, 2010). For the Bādāmi Caḷukya capital at Pattadakal, Vasundhara and Pierre Filliozat, Śaiva Monuments of Paṭṭadakal (New Delhi: Archaeological Survey of India, 2016), available as an online publication from the ASI due to budget cuts, is indispensable, though, as Srinivasa Padigar pointed out to me, one must be careful of some bowdlerization of the translation of inscriptions, especially those pertaining to artisans. http://121.242.207.115/asi.nic.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Pattadakal_16_0516.pdf, accessed April 27, 2023.

Marathawada.615 To this very limited and in many ways heterogeneous corpus, one might well 
add the few remaining Kadamba structures. Most of these are associated with the founder of 
the dynasty, Mayuravarma (r. 345–365), a Brāhmaṇa who famously responded to the 
disrespect directed at him when he went to continue his Vedic studies at Kanchi by taking up 
the sword and founding his own dynasty.616

615Henry Cousens, “Ter-Tagara,” in Archaeological Survey of India, Annual Reports, 1902—03 (Calcutta: Superintendent of Government Printing, 1904), 200–203 offers our first discussion of this important site, which, while exceedingly well known among Indian Archaeologists and paleobotanists is scarcely discussed in the modern Western academy. Cousens returned to Ter several times and his program of research was eventually inherited by Deccan College. See for example, M. S. Mate, “The Trivikram Temple at Ter,” Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute 18 (1957): 1–4. Ter was excavated in 1958 by K. N. Dikshit. Dr. B. N. Chapekar continued the work in 1967–68 and it was extended by Dr. S. B. Deo from the Deccan College in 1974– 75. Currently a new wave of excavations is underway under the direction of Dr. Sahapurkar Patil. Excavations have revealed material culture going back to the Sātavāhanas, indicative of Ter serving as a major trade center with evidence of exchanges with Rome and China. Because of the abundance of premodern pollen sample, the site is also of great importance to the study of paleobotany. Deglurkar, Temple Architecture and Sculpture of Marathawada offers one of the most comprehensive treatments of the site from the perspective of art history. Contrary to popular perceptions, there is no material cultural evidence that this was a Buddhist vihāra that was then taken over by Hindu communities. 616Apart from the many studies of the individual epigraphical texts themselves, a good relatively recent synthetic work is Govind Swamirao Gai, Inscriptions of the Early Kadambas (Delhi: Indian Council of Historical Research 1996).

The temple of Prāṇaveśvara he had built at Talaguna, for example, apart from the 
representation of door guards in relief, resembles a large stone box.617 For our purposes, what 
is most pertinent is the formal simplicity of these buildings, their focused iconographic 
program, as well as their location. Where images are still in evidence, they contain either a 
four-armed standing Viṣṇu or an immense śivaliṅga. Furthermore, the archeological record at 
both Ter and Talagunda tells a story of almost continuous habitation in the region for many 
centuries predating the building of these structures. In other words, in both cases these are 
temples that, apart from their basic religious affiliation, communicate no particular array of 
messages to a visitor. In each instance, the temples are situated in close spatial relationship to 
the everyday world. 
A possible counterexample ascribed to the Kadamba period is found at Chandravalli in 
central Karnataka, at the site where Mayurvarman took refuge upon his return from the Tamil 
country.618 Here too patterns of habitation allow us to document human occupancy of much of 
the surrounding terrain well back into the prehistoric era. Alongside the banks of the main lake, 
as one ascends up into hills, however, one finds two very different traces of the Kadamba past. 
Right alongside Mayurvarman’s most famous inscription, the subterranean cave temple of 
Ankali has functioned as a Śaiva maṭha, complete with its own shrines and library, since at 
617Since B. L. Lewis discovered and deciphered the Talagunda Pillar in 1902, the site has become integral to the construction of Deccani historiography and the ligatures of the inscription have become foundational to the study of paleography. The inscription and its translation are published in Epigraphia Indica vol. VIII. E. Hultzsch, ed., Epigraphia Indica vol. VIII (Calcutta: Government Printing, 1905–1906). Some important key studies published subsequently include the following. D. C. Sircar, The Successors of the Satavahanas (Calcutta: University of Calcutta, 1939). B. R. Gopal, (1997) Epigraphical Studies (Mysore: Directorate of Archeology and Museums, 1997). S. V. Sohoni, “Guptas, Kadambas, Pallavas and Kalidasa,” The Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute 60, no. 1–4 (1979): 1–40. For a recent discussion of its significance, see Michael Willis, The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009). 618 Though in many ways it is dated, and there have been four subsequent excavations, because subsequent works simply present themselves as addendums, the most accessible monograph on Candravalli is the publication, Excavations at Chandravalli (Mysore: Mysore Archaeological Department, 1931).

least the fourth century. Even more intriguingly, at the top of the hills, there stands a small box 
shaped shrine. Dedicated to Bhairava. it contains an image of the deity that is not altogether 
dissimilar from our few surviving traces of the Kadamba sculptural tradition. If it is authentic, 
the earliest trace of this sort of religious system in Karnataka, where the veneration of Bhairava 
forms a part of royal religion but is placed at some distance from multipurpose space intended 
for diverse publics, may well be the product of the fourth or fifth century of the Common Era. 
Map of the heart of the western Bādāmi Caḷukya imperial landscape. 
Should we choose, however, to discard the alleged Kadamba Bhairava as spurious, our 
story would instead begin, among the Bādāmi Caḷukyas themselves in the mid-sixth or early- 
seventh century. At this time, the Bādāmi Caḷukya capital was still located in town of Aihole. 
Like all of the eventual locations (Badami, Pattadakal) which serve as dynastic capitals in the 
coming centuries, Aihole is situated in the verdant Malaprabha Valley wedged between hills 
made of sandstone, an ideal strategic position for resisting outside invaders. 
Given that this region contains one of the richest arrays of archaeological sites on the 
Indian subcontinent, many of them set against some of the most compelling landscapes in the 
613 
Deccan, that the mid-seventh-century temple now called Nāganāthakŏḷḷa should have attracted 
very little attention is hardly surprising.619 Located in an out of the way corner of the 
Malaprabha Valley, even today to reach the temple one must pass through dense jungle. It was 
in this remote place however, that archaeologists associated with the Archeological Survey of 
India recovered a collection of tantalizing fragmentary images. 
619The temple at Nāganāthakŏlla was built during the reign of Vinayāditya (r. 681–696 CE), whose father Vikramāditya I very publicly converted to an unspecified “Śaiva” tradition in 660 CE. As we shall see later in chapter 7, Vinayāditya is also the first figure in the dynasty for whom there is documentary evidence of the forging of a ritual connection between royal power in the central Deccan and the religious authorities at Kolhapur, who during this period seem to have been Kāpālikas. A considerable Kāpālika influence is also in evidence at the so- called Brahmēśvara temple at Alampur, which was constructed by Vinayāditya and his sister under the influence of the rājaguru who had initiated their father, perhaps suggesting we should reassess just what sort of “śaivamaṇḍala” the Bādāmi Caḷukyas were initiated into.

The image above hardly does justice to either the grandeur or grotesque quality of this 
representation of Kaṅkāla Bhairava. Seated, the god is nearly six feet tall. Were he to rise he 
would likely tower over us. Recovered from the same location, all of them seated or squatting, 
the Aihole Field Museum also preserves the heads and torsos of the seven mothers, rendered 
in a similar style, which in situ would have encircled our macabre cremation ground couple. 
Plausibly related to the temple, which would have housed this pantheon, we also find a 
fragmentary panel from the same period. This appears to depict two distinctive though perhaps 
related scenes.

On the right, a devotee performs worship before a large Śaiva liṅga of the sort we find still 
installed in many temples from the period. On the left, in contrast, an emaciated and horrific 
entity bearing what may be a long scalpel prepares to make a sacrifice. Depending on whether 
the entity in question, plausibly identified with Kaṅkāla Bhairava, for the head-dress and body 
616 
are similar, was imagined to be as massive as our mūrtis, the offering is either a young child, 
or perhaps a full-grown human.620 
To make sense of such fragments, we must travel a considerable distance to a rather 
unexpected destination: the caves at Ellora, more than two hundred and fifty miles to the north- 
west in the heart of the Marathawada. In the modern imagination, Ellora is virtually 
synonymous with the Kailāsa Temple (cave 16), which was likely constructed by the 
Rāṣṭrakūṭa King Kṛṣṇa I (756–773 CE), perhaps with some contributions from his predecessor 
Dantidurga. By that time, however, most of the hundred caves at Ellora has already been 
excavated centuries beforehand. During the period with which we are concerned, the 
Kalachuris of Mahiṣmatī as well as the Bādāmi Caḷukyas seem to have been active contributors 
to developing Ellora’s religious ecology.621 
620A tradition of the worship of Kaṅkāla Bhairava is already evident in the circa sixth/seventh-century Picumata Brahmayāmala. Shaman Hatley has suggested that it may well have been incorporated into the text from an even earlier source in which goddesses played a more marginal role. Thus, as Csaba Kiss has pointed out, in chapter four of the BY, which presents the maṇḍala of the system, the main goddess is conspicuously absent from the ritual. 621Our clearest survey of the older literature, especially the early writings of Walter Spink, and some of the best critical analysis is found in Jack Laughlin, A Reconsideration of the So-called Kalachuri Monuments of the 
617Detail: Indrāṇī, Ellora, Rāmeśvara cave. 
Deccan and Konkan (MA Thesis, McMaster University, 1993), conducted under the direction of Phyllis Granoff and Walter Spink. Challenging Spink, who monocausually attributes the patronage of a network of Deccani sites to Kalachuri patronage and oversight, Laughlin argues that the Kalachuris, Caḷukyas, and possibly Koṅkani Mauryas instead share a common pool of craftsmen who are themselves linked with transregional Śaiva religious orders. What Laughlin has overlooked is that in the inscriptions at Pattadakal, we have repeated a pact being formed in the seventh century between the Bādāmi Caḷukyas and these very artisans, in which a promise is made that the kings will protect these communities from being outcasted. This social compact coincides with the ritual initiation of the Caḷukya kings into the śaivamaṇḍala as well as a sudden efflorescence of material cultural production in stone. 
At three of the caves (Rāmeśvara, Daśāvatāra, and cave 25) we find the very same 
eerily familiar—indeed downright eerie in general—iconographic program is at work. In each 
case, when you enter into the complex, the figures are to your right, but always situated in a 
manner so that they are scarcely visible from the main hall and are generally kept out of the 
light. 
618 
B. Photograph courtesy of the ASI: The full panel of Māṭrkās, Ellora, Rāmeśvara cave. 
At two of the sites, the visual anchor of the space is a standing skeletal Bhairava accompanied 
by an equally emaciated consort. To their left, one finds a panel of mothers. In each case, they 
are represented in a sensuous style, individually differentiated in their dress, assets, age as well 
as personality. The idiom is courtly, akin to what one finds in the renderings of the gods in the 
rest of the complex, and the scale is human. 
619 
Bhairava’s representation, in contrast, is jarringly different. In the Rāmeśvara cave, raised up 
from the ground, the ten-foot-tall skeletal Bhairava towers not only above human viewers, but 
also the gods who have come to pay him homage and the ghouls that seek refuge by clinging 
to his skinless lotus-feet. His wife Bhairavī, though the same sort of creature, and thus bigger 
than the other figures in the scene, is positively petite beside him. Clearly the likely 
unrecoverable theology that underwrote this tableau belonged to a register of the Bhairava 
Siddhānta where the terrifying lord was still in charge with the goddess treated as complement 
or after thought.

A similar scene repeats itself at Daśāvatāra, 
where again a somewhat genial looking skeletal 
Bhairava, is accompanied by a retinue of mothers 
and a Gaṇeśa, who standing would just about 
reach his navel, as well as his doting skeleton 
wife. Here the images are not merely 
inconspicuous, but reside in the back corner of 
the cave in near total darkness, and in fact can

Finally, at the unnamed cave twenty-five, in a secluded cave on the right side of the entry to 
the site segregated from the rest of the complex, while the full array of the mothers as well as 
Bhairava and his consort are all depicted seated, once again a skeletal Bhairava and his consort 
are set aside from the rest and represented as considerably scaled up from their retinue. Thus, 
despite some variations in style, across a temporal span of a least several hundred years and 
geographical region comprised of at least several hundred miles, a distinctively cremation 
ground culture religious sensibility—centered around Bhairava, his consort, and the mothers— 
formed a consistent part of the idiom with which the powerful portrayed the sacred. From the 
sixth to eighth century, whatever its particular semantic content, set aside in space and style of 
presentation from other representations of the gods, Bhairava and his consort continued to be 
depicted in the same general manner, right down to their headgear and hats. 
622 
Something different starts to happen among the Rāṣṭrakūṭas, who appear have held 
slightly different commitments. At Kailāsa itself, the gallery of the mothers once again is 
situated upon an elevated platform on the right side of the complex, positioned in a manner so 
that until one ascends most of the way up the stairs the figures remain invisible. As one reaches 
the landing, the viewer encounters representation of mothers in keeping with the thematic and 
Gallery of the mothers at Kailāsa, Ellora. 
stylistic elements we have already explored. Something is conspicuously absent however from 
this arrangement, for in the place where we would anticipate seeing Bhairava and his consort, 
seated on a throne made of corpses and ghouls there is only a single figure of somewhat 
indeterminate gender. Indeed, even in situ it is difficult to determine if the sizeable genitalia 
that hang over the deities emaciated leg are a part of its body or the corpse throne on which it 
sits. If it is the former, this may be an image of the skeletal Bhairava. Perhaps his consort has 
623 
been demoted. If it is the latter, Bhairava has vanished from this scene, and in his place, we 
observe all the female pantheons that increasingly emerge with the later Śākta Tantras. 
Elsewhere in a distinctively Rāṣṭrakūṭa milieu, however, one encounters more 
substantial indications that the reinvention of this particular religious idiom, with Bhairava and 
the goddess becoming decoupled from each other without either fading in significance, is 
already well underway. The Rāṣṭrakūṭa capital at Mānyakheṭa was razed to the ground at least 
twice, once by the invading Cōḻa army and then again in the sack of city carried out by the 
Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya king Taila that brought his dynasty into power, so it is hardly surprising that 
nothing of substance remains. However, as my colleague Saili Palande-Datar has pointed out, 
drawing upon her work assisting Arunachandra Pathak, substantial Rāṣṭrakūṭa remains survive 
at their secondary capital at Kandhar, in Nanded District, Maharashtra, close to the Telangana 
624 
border. To do the material justice would require a more extensive study than can be carried out 
in the present context. 
Kandhar: Goddess encircled by seven mothers. 
(image left) offers another possibility: an 
As a matter of fact, however, at Kandhar, Bhairava622 has not disappeared. Perhaps because he 
had outgrown his surroundings, he has simply been relocated. 
622As the present work was being revised, Arunachandra Pathak’s research was published under the title Kille Kandhāra va Rāṣṭrakūṭaskālīn Śilpavaibhava by the press Merven Technology. I have yet to have a chance to consult this finished work. All photographs presented here from Kandhar were taken by Saili Palande-Datar while she was in the field with Arunachandra Pathak or by Dr. Pathak himself. Special thanks are due to Dr. Pathak and Datar for allowing their inclusion and the reader is directed to engage directly with Dr. Pathak’s exceptional discovery. 
625 
Apart from several bronzes depicting 
Śiva and Parvatī, Jain, and possibly 
Buddhist images, the Kandhar horde 
contains numerous individual life-size 
depictions of the mothers analogous to 
those found at Ellora. The repetition of 
several of the same figures suggests that 
multiple temples dedicated to the 
mothers must have existed in the 
vicinity. In contrast, the unidentified 
representation of supreme goddess 
surrounded by mothers in miniature 
all-female pantheon. 
Top: Colossal head of Bhairava at Kandhar. Below, other parts of his body given to scale. 
Nor was such a colossal image, the bridge of whose nose is a tall as a man, something unique 
to the royal center at Kandhar. At least six such figures have survived into the present day, 
though each is in a fragmentary form, and their locations are scattered throughout the western 
Deccan. In fact, almost two hundred miles to the north, outside the domain of Marathawada in 
the region of Buldhana in the town of Anandpur, again found in the company of separate 
representations of the goddess and the mothers, we find a substantively bigger image from the 
Rāṣṭrakūṭa period of the very same sort, though in this case the head has sadly been destroyed. 
626 
Remains of colossal Bhairava at Anandpur. 
When such images are encountered at a remove from their original interpretive context 
either in the form of entextualized discourse or the interrelated spatial field where they were 
once embedded, an opportunity presents itself for ungrounded speculation and over- 
interpretation. Resisting such inclinations, let us stick with a minimalist even conservative 
reading of the evidence at hand inflected by our earlier explorations of related issues. From the 
sixth to the mid-ninth century, in a range of sites found across the western Deccan between the 
Narmadā and the Kāverī, “Hindu” dynastic powers articulated a vision of religious life in 
which a sizeable place was set aside for terrifying powers associated with the Bhairava 
Siddhānta. Representations of these figures were executed in a distinct visual and spatial style. 
As we have as seen, this was inseparable from the idiom of cremation ground culture. 
Considering the amplified scale of the central images and its recurrence in settings where royal 
power is everywhere else on display, for at least three hundred years, this theology was 
somehow intimately linked with a theory of power. Contrary to what we would expect from 
627the textual record, which until very recently read the emergence of the worship of Bhairava as 
a tertiary subordinate phenomenon sparked by contact by between the purveyors of 
mainstream Hindu mythology with either tribal people or marginal communities,623 here 
Bhairava worship from its inception reads as an elite phenomenon. Instead of operating as an 
accrual that attaches itself to a pristine Śaiva base rather late in the historical record, which is 
precisely the sort of model implicit in the periodization of the scriptures presented by Alexis 
Sanderson and his disciples, if anything the evidence is pointing in the opposite direction. As 
mainstream Śaiva institutional life works its ways into the halls of power, it finds itself having 
to adapt to accommodate an archaic and originally perhaps entirely independent tradition of 
Bhairava worship intertwined with the performance of kingship. This dynamic seems to have 
been operation at least since the fourth century, for this is when the Vākāṭaka ruler Rudrasena 
I proudly introduced himself as bearing the title atyantasvāmīmahābhairavabhakta, and when 
the kings of Valkha, antecedents to the Kalachuris of Mahiṣmatī, as well as the Kadamba King 
Mayūravarman all within a period of a hundred years proclaimed their allegiances to the 
Terrifying Lord across a terrain encompassing most of the western Deccan.624 In each of these 
623Though ascribing subaltern and tribal origins of Tantra is a well-known trope on the subcontinent, especially among Bengali Marxists, the most famous contemporary presentation of this position is articulated in Ronald Davidson, Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement (New York: Columbia University Press, 2002). See especially pg. 202–223, and on tribal origins for Bhairava in particular, pg. 210–13. 624The text of these inscriptions was published and translated in Vasudeva Vishnu Mirashi, ed., Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum Vol.5 (Inscriptions of the Vākāṭakas) (Ootacamund: Government Epigraphist for India, 1963). As is noted by his descendants, one of the earliest of the Vākāṭaka kings, Rudrasena I (r. 330–355) is represented in the genealogies of his descendants, including Kālidāsa’s probable patron Pravarasena, as a fervent devotee of Mahābhairava. Mirashi’s subsequent discovery of the only surviving inscription issued by Rudrasena I, found in the town of Deotek in the Candrapur region of northeastern Maharashtra, adds to this picture, for it is scrawled on top of one Aśokan pillar inscriptions, which Rudrasena I seems to have had converted into a platform for offering blood sacrifices. 
Siddham, a project conducted under the auspices of the British Museum which aims to provide both new editions and plates of the texts of Sanskrit inscriptions currently includes two texts (the Masod Charter of Pravarasena II and a fragmentary charter from Mohalla) where Rudrasena I is characterized in this fashion. The first text reads: svasti pravarapurād agniṣṭomāpto(r)yyāmokthyaṣoḍaśyatirātra{-ḥ} 2vājapeyabṛhaspitisava sādya(s)kra{- tu}caturaśvamadhayājinaḥ 3viṣṇu_2_vṛddhasagotrasya sam{-b}rājaḥ vākāṭakānām mahā - 4rājaśripravarasenasya sūno(?ḥ) sūno(?ḥ) atya(nt)asvāmimahābhai - 5ravabhaktasya asambhārasanniveśita- 
628 
cases, the accommodation of this tradition animated by a divergent set of values, which the 
visual record would seem to suggest included the incorporation of at least occasional acts of 
human sacrifice, seems to be accomplished through acts of segregation that delineate a separate 
spatial and conceptual space where such values can be constructively performed. 
From the mid-ninth century onward, in contrast, we begin to witness a somewhat 
different dynamic. Correlated it seems625 with the rise of the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas, traditions of 
Bhairava veneration and their unmistakable iconography are integrated first into shared and 
then into multifunctional spaces. As we will see, during the reign of Vikramāditya VI, the 
visual idiom of the cremation ground culture is reimagined as one among many components 
of the sculptural program that adorns a temple. Instead of placing Bhairava and his consort in 
their own distinctive caves or temple sites situated on the edges of the social world, they are 
assigned a liminal spot within the microcosm of the temple itself. 
In general, from the early tenth up through the thirteenth century, we see several 
different arrangements at play concurrently within the same regions. In the first, large images

The form of these two texts points to the identification of the fourth century Rudrasena I as a Mahābhairavabhakta as an accepted chancellery formula, suggesting that by the fourth century, not only does a royal tradition of the worship of Mahābhairava exist, but that its operation is not terribly controversial among the ruling families to whom the Gupta Kings will marry their children in the next generations. 625Subsequent research suggests the dynamics at work here are more complex and point to a pivotal role being played by dynastic powers, especially the Nolambas, and Śākta-Śaiva networks whose point of origin lie in the eastern Deccan, who articulate a competing royal cult of Bhairava with its own distinctive imagery and values that travels with them as they stake a claim to territories in the western Deccan. This topic is too far afield from the scope of our current western Deccan centric investigation, however, and its explication will have to await another occasion, following further fieldwork. 
629 
of Bhairava, sometimes paired with his consort, are placed in a separate shrine alongside the 
main temple but within the same complex. In the second, smaller decorative or relief images 
of Bhairava and his consort are integrated into liminal spaces, often tucked in the midst of a 
more standard iconographic program depicting scenes from Indian mythology. Such figures 
could be carved on the exterior of the threshold before the garbhagṛha, an arrangement we 
have already seen at Māṇakeśvara. Small images could be also installed inside the temple in 
the niches before the entrance to the threshold of the shrine, as in Raṭṭa royal temples, as will 
soon become evident.626 They could be engraved on the pillars nearest to the main shrine, as 
occurs in the Mahādeva Temple at Itagi. Or, finally, especially in evidence in the corpus of 
Hoysala architecture that is transparently the product of Kālamukha patronage, Bhairavas are 
installed in elevated positions on the śikhara of the temple itself. 
Two features of this pattern of production are particularly essential for understanding 
what is new about the greater Cāḷukya world, whose conceptual frames structure social and 
religious realities from the mid-ninth to mid-thirteenth century throughout the Deccan. The 
first is that there is a retreat from the unapologetic representation of Bhairava and his retinue 
through the lens of his terrifying and utterly non-human strangeness that animates the earlier 
images of enormous emaciated Bhairavas, purposefully setting them apart from the more 
anthropomorphic sensibility used to represent the rest of the gods. If Bhairava is to share space 
with the rest of the religious imaginary, it must happen at the expense of muting his 
distinctiveness, except perhaps in spaces in the temple not easily accessible to the eyes of the 
626Apart from the publication of the inscriptions themselves, no study exists of Raṭṭa temples or the material culture in Saundatti. The only substantive survey, which I used to locate and document the temples, is found in James M. Campbell, ed., Gazetteer of The Bombay Presidency vol. XXI, Belgaum (Bombay: Government Central Press, 1884), 603–604.

majority of visitors. Equally importantly, at the very same moment that he is integrated into 
the general religious imaginary, images of Bhairava become ubiquitous, receiving veneration 
and patronage from virtually the entire spectrum of society. Indeed, it is precisely this 
proliferation of images of Bhairava and his retinue that distinguish the temples of the early 
medieval Deccan from most of the subsequent and previous iterations of Hindu temple culture. 
For our purposes, a few brief engagements with select examples illustrating the range of the 
phenomena and its occurrence in different contexts will suffice.

The gallery you have just viewed, chosen from my photos almost at random, 
encompasses images from the territories of what are now three different states. In some cases, 
these images are separated from each other by a distance of more than five hundred miles. And 
yet, despite the fact that they were produced in many cases under the patronage of dynastic 
powers engaged in bitter rivalries and open conflict with each other, they are all quite clearly 
products of the same iconographic conventions intended to evoke analogous religious visions. 
As we can see, with the notable exception of the piece from Hooli, the product of an earlier 
sensibility that persisted among the now much diminished Kadamba kings, in each of the 
images, Bhairava has been further anthropomorphized. His frame has filled out, sometimes to 
the point of corpulence, and he has taken on some of the more general trappings associated 
with warrior classes in the Deccan. 
These same traits are also in evidence in the placement of smaller paired representations 
of the deity and his consort at the heart of a small temple, a development best exemplified by 
the royal temples of the Raṭṭa dynasty. Though the Raṭṭas of Saundatti claim descent from the 
Rāṣṭrakūṭas, they belong to a line that traces its origins not to Manyakheṭa, but rather to Latur 
in southeastern Maharashtra, several hours from the Cāḷukya capital at Kalyāṇa.627 Exactly 
what sort of circumstances drove them to relocate the dynasty two hundred miles to the south 
in the center of Karnataka remain obscure, but by the early tenth century, we find them 
established alongside the bank of lake now called Renuka Sagar, less than an hour to the south 
of Shirshangi. The clan goddess of the Raṭṭas, who resides on a hill just outside of the city, is

Fleet, “A Series of Sanskrit and Old Canarese Inscriptions relating to the Ratta Chieftains of Saundatti and Belgaum, Copied from the Originals and Edited, with Translations, Notes, and Remarks,” Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, 10 (1871–1874): 167–298.

today understood to represent the transregional non-Brāhmaṇical “folk” goddess Yeḷlammā or 
Reṇukā Devī. 
Saundatti serves as the main ritual center of the tradition, and the place is closely 
associated in the popular imagination with traditions of so-called sacred prostitution and 
transgender Jogappa devotees. Indeed, Yeḷḷammā, whose worship is prevalent throughout the 
Deccan, is often perceived as goddess especially associated with the Dalit castes.628 In light of 
this dominant narrative, which seeks to locate the goddess in an exclusively Dravidian and 
subaltern milieu, it is somewhat disconcerting that Yeḷḷammā is housed in an imposing 
eleventh-century temple executed in a typical Cāḷukya style. Indeed, both the inscriptional and 
archaeological record, while offering no traces of her subaltern histories, suggest that in the 
tenth through twelfth centuries, the temple on the hill was ritually linked to two smaller 
structures integral to the ritual life of Raṭṭas, both of which are located in their capital city and 
each of which embeds in situ an inscription documenting the conditions under which the 
temple and its pantheon were installed. Scarcely large enough to fit five people, the temple of 
Puradhēśvara is situated underground and today lies sunken down in the middle of a working- 
class neighborhood. 
628In keeping with anti-superstition political campaigns, the vast majority of literature on Yeḷḷammā treats her worship as a thinly veiled vehicle for prostitution that has exploited low-caste women allegedly forced into sex slavery as devadāsīs for thousands of years. For a much more subtle and nuanced reading, the reader is directed to Lucinda Ramberg, Given to the Goddess: South Indian Devadasis and the Sexuality of Religion (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2014). Ramberg’s represents the Jogappas and Jogatīs as effectively a class of female Śākta adepts who perform pūjā to the goddess. The lifelong relations some of these adepts have with certain men seem to echo an older (though itself sometimes exploitative) logic of the bond between sādhaka and consort. The first of these observations finds confirmation in my own fieldwork. In Maharashtra in particular, Jogatīs are treated by people in rural regions not with disdain, but rather with the same mix of awe and apprehension directed towards male Śākta adepts, siddhas, and śivayogins. Several of the Jogatīs I encountered in the Marathawada and around the Andhra borderlands had been initiated by male gurus as śiṣyas within a Tantric paramparā and appeared to be engaging in forms of practice and meditation that involved subtle body yogas, apart from their social role as providing blessings to families for children and providing folk medicine.

637carried out more surreptitiously. Generally acknowledged as one of the first masterpieces of 
the “new” Kalyāṇi Cālukya style, the Mahādeva Temple, called the “Emperor of temples,” was 
built by Mahādeva Daṇḍanāyaka, a favored military commander of Vikramāditya VI, whose 
labelled portrait629 adorns the canopy surrounding the pūrvaraṅga. The temple of Mahādeva 
was established in 1112 CE in the middle of space that had seen uninterrupted occupation by 
self-identified Pāśupatas for at least several hundreds of years beforehand.630 The grounds 
where the temple was to be built already housed a series of shrines, some likely dating back to 
the eighth century (or even earlier), where Pāśupata yogins had taken samādhi, as well as a 
maṭha where the community resided, complete with a ghaṭikāśāla dedicated to the teaching of 
the Vedas and the śāstras. In other words, Mahādeva commissioned a temple in his name in a 
space with its own longstanding institutional culture that for centuries had been under the

Nagaraja Rao (Delhi: Agam Kala Prakashan, 1987): 311–14. 630The Mahādeva Temple was first documented and brought to the attention of the academic community in Henry Cousens, Chāḷukyan Architecture of the Kanarese Districts (Calcutta: Government of India, Central Publication Branch, 1926). Cousens documents the site before renovations and offers detailed floor plans. See also the technical detail in Meister and Dhaky, Encylopedia of Indian Temple Architecture, 195–202, some of which has been superseded by the exhaustive visual documentation of the site carried out by Gerard Foekema in his lavishly illustrated three volume study, Gerard Foekema, Cālukya Architecture: Medieval Temples of Northern Karnātaka Built during the Rule of the Cālukya of Kalyāna and Thereafter, AD 1000-1300 (New Delhi: Munishram Manoharlal, 2003), 383–400), for which the corresponding plates (527–551) are found in volume 2. As for the inscriptions, the major texts appear in Sten Konow and F. W. Thomas, ed., Epigraphia Indica Vol. XIII (Calcutta: Superintendent Government Printing, 1915–1916), 35–149, translated by Lionell Barnett.

It is thus a testament to the pervasiveness of the religious sensibility we are beginning to 
recover as well as its liturgical centrality in the medieval Deccan that even here, Bhairava and 
his consort as a framed pair appear on the lower pedestal of the columns before the entranceway 
leading to the garbhagrḥa. 
In considerable contrast, in the very same region, religious centers that are both 
constructed and governed by Kālamukha preceptors frequently make a more ostentatious 
display of these commitments. The eleventh-century Cāḷukya-period Kaḷēśvara temple at 
Huvina Hadagali,631 the city of “the flowery boat,” for example, offers a pristine presentation 
631According to popular, but likely spurious tradition, “the city of flowery boats” acquired its name due its vast gardens supplying the flowers used in worship at the temples of Hampi. The Kaḷēśvara temple is discussed in Meister and Dhaky, The Encyclopedia of Indian Temple Architecture, 140–142. Foekema’s treatment in Cālukya Architecture is more extensive (pg. 370–377) for which the corresponding plates (506–52) are found in volume 2. Most of the relevant inscriptions are found in R. Shama Sastry, ed., South Indian Inscriptions, Vol IX Part I: Kannada Inscriptions from the Madras Presidency (Madras: Superintendent, Government Press, 1939). Though not relevant for our purposes here, the second temple at Huvina Hadagali is equally interesting, for it houses what is probably the only Cāḷukya-period image of Bālakṛṣṇa still in situ which is organically integrated into a Śākta tinged environment that seems to be roughly contemporary.

In addition to its temples, it is supposedly the place where Ādipampa, the Kālidāsa of Kannada literature, wrote his masterpiece, the Pampābhārata. Ādipampa was a Jain and in medieval times, much as it is today, the town was divided between Jain centres and those aligned with Śākta-Śaivas. Puligere was also a major center for artisan castes, and still houses an early medieval temple dedicated to the god of gold smiths as well as the Kālikā of Sirshangi.

In fact, rather unusually, this Somēśvara does not merely derive its name from some

The famous thirty-sixth through thirty-eighth verses of the work read: “The land called Kannada, renowned among the regions / of the world, lies between the rivers Kāvēri and Godāvari // Especially, the land bordered by Kisuvoḷalu, famous city, called Kopaṇa, and Puligere is the heart of Karnataka // The people of that land [i.e., the region around Puilgere] are good in speaking and understanding what is spoken by others; / by nature they are talented and, though not scholars, they are competent in poetic experiments.” C.

Detail of Bhairavī on the śikhara at Kēdārēśvara temple, Balligave, ur-maṭha of the Śaktipariṣad line of Kālamukhas. 
Finally, in the district of Shimoga, central Karnataka—scarcely two miles from the 
Prāṇavēśvara temple established by Mayūravarman in the fourth century—lies Balligave, 
quintessential hub of Kālamukha religiosity. In violation of virtually everything suggested to 
us by over a century’s worth of secondary literature634 produced without much attention to its 
634More than eighty inscriptions, most of them unusually long and detailed, have been found at Balligave alone. The vast majority of these have been published in B. Lewis Rice, ed., Epigraphia Carnatica, Vol. VII: Inscritpions of the Shimoga District, Part I (Bangalore: Mysore Government Central Press, 1902). As a testament to its transregional influence, there are likely hundreds of allusions to Balligave and especially its central temples of Kēdārēśvara and Tripurāntakēśvara found throughout the wider inscriptional corpus. The site is first mentioned in a Bādāmi Caḷukya inscription from 680 CE, though at this early date there are no indications of the presence of the Lākula Siddhānta. David Lorenzen has argued that the earliest mention of the Śaktipariṣad appears in a Rāṣṭrakūṭa inscription issued by Kṛṣṇa II (c. 880–914 CE) at the town of Anaji, about two hours to the west of Balligave. From this inscription it seems like the lineage already had roots in the region. As we will see momentarily, the oldest intact material culture found at Balligave dates back the Rāṣṭrakūṭas. See David Lorenzen, The Kāpālikas and Kālāmukhas: Two Lost Śaivite Sects, 2nd rev. ed. (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1991 [1972]), 232. 
Though vague allusions to Kālamukha traditions are found throughout Indian secondary literature from the late nineteenth century onward, in the context of Religious Studies, the importance of the Śaktipariṣad was first made evident by David Lorenzen in his masterful monograph The Kāpālikas and Kālamukhas: Two Lost Śaivite Sects. Out of a two hundred and twenty page monograph on the Kāpālikas and Kālamukhas, forty-two pages are dedicated to the study of the Śaktipariṣad, and much of the analysis is concerned with ācāryas institutionally affiliated with maṭhas at Balligave. Lorenzen’s core argument aims at refuting the characterization of the Kālamukhas as a heterodox sect and he does so largely on the basis of the extensive śāstric learning that is on display in their praśāstis, which he assumes stands in contradistinction to heterodox Tantric commitments. As we have seen, the situation on the ground, where there were in fact no natural antinomies assumed to exist between 
645 
material culture, the visual repertoire that permeates this captivating town is irreducibly Śākta. 
Thus, for example, many replications of Bhairavī adorns the peak of the Kēdārēśvara complex 
of the Śaktipariṣad, heart of the institutionalized Kālamukha traditions of the medieval Deccan, 
in operation from the time of the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas to the middle of the thirteenth century. 
extreme erudition in “mainstream” śāstra and the observing of transgressive Śākta commitments, seems to have been much more considerably complicated. In a similar spirit, in his invaluable “Saffron in the Rasam,” which traces the interconnections between the Deccan and Kashmir, Whitney Cox has written about a Sanskrit inscription found at Balligave whose maṅgala verse match those that open the Kashmiri Jayantabhaṭṭa’s Nyāyamañjarī. Whitney Cox, “Saffron in the Rasam,” in South Asian Texts in History: Critical Engagements with Sheldon Pollock, ed. Yigal Bronner, Whitney Cox, and Lawrence McCrea (Ann Arbor, MI: Association for Asian Studies, 2011): 177–201. 
The precision of Lorenzen’s analysis is in many cases dependent on the old Kannada translations of Lewis Rice, which, especially when it comes to religious matters, frequently leave much to be desired. This dimension of his work has been as of now largely superseded by the unpublished writings of Shubha Shanthamurthy, who has kindly shared her exceptional MA thesis, An Epigraphical Account of the Śaiva Institutions of Baḷḷigāve (11c AD-12c AD) (MA Thesis, University of Oxford, 2015). Based on a study of more than 400 inscriptions, Shanthamurthy offers critiques and considerably improved translations of texts studied by Lorenzen, while also bringing to our attention many new sources. Shanthamurthy’s translations run from pg. 75–109. In place a reified category of the Śaktipariṣad as the sole social actor on the field at Balligave, Shanthamurthy points to the coexistence of seven lineages of Kālamukhas, non-Kālamukha Śaiva ascetics, as well as maṭhas associated with other religious communities including Buddhists and Jains. The first evidence she finds of ascetics in situ who self-identify as Kālamukha date from 1019, (pg. 16) but as she notes, this inscription and many others allude to enough predecessors in their line residing in the region that we should probably assume such figures were already present in the tenth century. Refuting Lorenzen’s assumption of the Brāhmaṇical identities of most Kālamukha preceptors, a position which, to be fair, he softens in his 1991 appendix to the original edition, Shanthamurthy provides us with substantial evidence that many of the most important ācāryas at Balligave in fact were Vaiśyas. Thus, she writes: 
“Lorenzen (1991) argues that kāḷāmukhas most probably belonged to the brāhmaṇa caste or claimed brāhmaṇa status based on the description of Sōmēśvara Paṇḍita of Kēdārēśvara as a sārasvata mahōdaya in an inscription of 1113AD. Lorenzen identifies this with the Sāraswat brāhmaṇas of present-day Karnataka and Kashmir. This is contrary to the evidence of the Balligave inscription of 1171AD , which mentions one Dāsi Seṭṭi, the son of rājaguru Vāmaśakti Dēva, who was married to Muddauve and had a son himself. That the suffix ‘-seṭṭi’ indicated a vaiśya (or baṇajiga) is evident from numerous inscriptions. Certainly, the most famous of the Baḷḷigāve kāḷāmukha ācāryas appears to have come from one of the merchant families of the town; however, the kāḷāmukha inscriptions of Balligave by and large ignore caste. Shanthamurthy, An Epigraphical Account of the Śaiva Institutions of Baḷḷigāve, 18. 
The only one substantive critique of the textual analysis on hand is that, as we will see, Shanthamurthy’s explanation of the pañcamaṭha system as an administrative network comprised of a separate Śaiva line holding possibly Saiddhāntika commitments is not supported by evidence from the rest of the Deccan. Instead, as will be argued in the next chapter, the term likely refers in most cases to the Śākta-Śaivas who serve as the caste gurus of the “fifth” or artisan caste.

647In fact, likely the oldest intact structure at Balligave, which incorporates numerous 
elements from the Rāṣṭrakūṭa period, is a Śākta ritual center still in worship. Now called the 
Kāḷamma temple, its ritual focus is the goddess Kālikā. In her short study of the related 
inscriptions, Shanthamurthy tells us that in the twelfth century, this goddess “was the guild 
goddess of metal workers, who are described as ‘sakalaguṇagaṇālaṅlkṛta satya śaucācāra 
naya Vinaya śīla sampannarum, śrī kāḷikā dēvī labdha vara prasādaram, pañca 
lōhādhipatigaḷ.”635 The pañcalōha in question are the five metals used especially for the 
making of mūrtis, and thus the ones who have sovereignty over such materials (adhipatigaḷ)

The image depicted, seated in a royal posture and bearing a sword and a shield, is the goddess now called Kāḷamma. She sits dead center, surrounded by her attendants, Gaṇeśa and a stack of human heads. Intriguingly, Śiva is nowhere to be seen. Stylistically, in terms of the rendering of the robust figures, their large scale, and the form of the piece as embedded in a large plaque affixed above the garbhagṛha that depicts a tableau as opposed to a single deity, this is unmistakably pre-eleventh-century Rāṣṭrakūṭa material culture.

are the caste gurus of the artisan communities responsible for the making of images, whose 
ranks would have included, at the very least, metal workers, stone masons, goldsmiths, and 
wood workers. Apart from the stone masons, who have largely vanished from the landscape, 
these are the very same constituencies that continue to worship at the Kāḷamma temple today.

Kāḷamma lies on the bank of the main lake which, while some distance away from the more 
famous temples of Kēdārēśvara and Tripurāntakēśvara, seems to represent the original ritual

636On this site, Shanthamurthy writes: “The temple of mūlasthāna Nandikēśvara is the oldest known to us in Baḷḷigāve. A partial stone inscription of 1019AD found in a backyard near a vīraśaiva shrine states that Kundamarasa, the ruler of Banavāsi-12000 under Cālukya Jayasiṃha II, who was camping in Balipura, had repairs made to the temple and on an auspicious day made grants of various parcels of land, garden and orchard to the mūliga Śivaśakti Paṇḍita to be used for the usual purposes of religious services and maintenance. . . . The praśasti of the mūliga is very similar to that of later kāḷāmukha ācāryas, but the inscription breaks off short and does not use the word kāḷāmukha. A second inscription found on a stone set up to the right of the present day Kallēśvara temple records two grants to svayambhū Kalidēvēśvara; the first of these is a grant of parcels of land and garden for religious services and temple repairs by Cālukya Jayasiṃha, on the petition of Kundamarasa, to 
650 
period temples as well as the dilapidated ruins of some early medieval maṭhas. The most 
important of these, which local people often identify as “the pañcamaṭha,” now under the care 
of the Kāśī śākhā of the Pañcācārya Paramparā of Vīraśaivas, retains its association with the 
goldsmith castes who now essentially control the Kāḷamma temple. According to people in the 
neighborhood, though Virakta Liṅgāyats would dispute this, the grounds surrounding this 
complex are said to mark the birthplace of Allama Prabhu, the focus of the Vijayanagar-period

While a thorough study of Balligave’s material culture could easily run onward for 
several more dozen pages, we would be remiss to not engage, if briefly, with the rather 
spectacular evidence for Śākta commitments in evidence at Balligave’s other “famous” temple, 
Tripurāntakēśvara. In orienting us to the rather extensive textual records associated with the 
site, selections from Shanthamurthy’s summaries of the available evidence are most useful. 
The temple is dated to early 12cAD or late 11cAD, and at least 30-40 years later than the construction of the Kēdārēśvara temple. It is said to be similar to, but probably pre-dating the earliest temples in Belur. We can reconstruct the history of the Tripurāntaka from 21 inscriptions. The earliest inscription referring to these kāḷāmukha ascetics belonging to the bhujaṅgāvaḷi of śakti pariṣe is from 1050AD. It is a grant to a disciple of Kaśmīra Paṇḍita Dēva for religious services of the deity Mallikārjuna of Bēgūru, which is a village about 20kms from Baḷḷigāve. The name of the disciple is defaced in this grant, but in another inscription of 1066AD found in the same place, we are told of a grant of land and a pond to Trilōcana Paṇḍita Dēva, disciple of Kāśmīra Paṇḍita Dēva, for feeding the students of the maṭha associated with Mallikārjuna. The praśasti of Trilōcana follows the usual kāḷāmukha pattern. The next reference to Trilōcana is in c.1070AD in a much damaged inscription found near the present day Tripurāntaka temple. It records a grant of a village by Barmadēva, feudatory of Cālukya Sōmēśvara II, to Trilōcana for the temple and maintenance of the ascetics of the maṭha. The praśasti of Trilocana in this inscription is unusual, in that while it identifies him as a 
652 
kāḷāmukha, it is written in a less Sanskrtized Kannada and does not follow the formula that most other kāḷāmukha praśastis do; nor does it appear to recount his lineage. . . . An inscription of 1077AD from the village of Maṭṭikōṭe near Bēgūru records a land grant by some Baḷḷigāve merchants for religious services of Mallikārjuna of Mariyāse installed earlier by them, and for maintaining the ascetics. . . . 
In 1096AD we are told that Sarvēśvara Dēva, a general of Cālukya Vikramāditya VI, built a temple with a golden kaḷaśa for the god Sarvēśvara of Tripurāntaka and granted a village for religious services and maintaining its ascetics. The recipient of these grants was Varēśvara Paṇḍita, who had now become the ācārya of Tripurāntaka. He is described as the foremost disciple of Trilōcana Dēva, who himself belonged to the lineage of the kāḷāmukha-cakravarti Kāśmīra Dēva. . . . In an inscription from the village Cikka Māgaḍi, 1182AD, the ācārya of Tripurāntaka, Sūryābharaṇa makes a grant for the sthaḷa vṛtti of a jinālaya. This kind of grant, to an institution of another religious sect, is unusual; however, since the village belonged to Tripurāntaka, the ācārya may have acted in the capacity of landlord or local ruler and made the grant to satisfy the inhabitants, many of whom must have been jaina.637 
Shanthamurthy’s distillation of the contents of nearly thirty old Kannada and Sanskrit 
inscriptions show us a ritual center founded by an ācārya from Kashmir that nonetheless 
managed within a generation to forge a direct link with the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya rulers themselves 
as well as their generals, on the one hand, and to establish constructive relationships with a 
range of local communities within Balligave itself, on the other. On the basis of 
Shanthamurthy’s investigation, 
however, we find little evidence, apart from the usual 
boiler plate, of what sort of commitments were held by 
its Kashmiri inspired Kālamukhas. In this regard, 
exquisite images preserved on both the interior and , 
exterior of the Tripurāntakēśvara temple, some of 
which seem to be sponsored by the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya 
kings and their ministers of war, prove most

are more subtle, now that we have an eye 
for what to look for, our visual archive 
allows us to retrace this same sort of story 
back to the site of the cultural articulation 
that time and again has proven so 
important to our story: the world of the 
Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas as epistomized by the 
rājadhāni of Kalyana where 
Vikramāditya VI and his successor 
Someśvara III reigned for the better part 
of a century.

a severed head rests her sword. Just as the male Kālamukha adept finds an esoteric counterpart 
in a four-armed Bhairava, our female Śākta adept shares much of her iconography with a seated 
four-armed Bhairavī, who, seated once again in a royal posture is also stepping upon a snake 
and wields a sword along with her triśūla, ḍamaru, and skull bowl. In other words, again

All that remains in the modern-day city of Kalyana associated with its non-śaraṇa past is a 
museum that prohibits photography and a fortification of primarily Indo-Muslim design. And 
though, as Richard Eaton and Phillip Wagoner have famously argued, later rulers in the 
Deccani Sultanate consciously appropriate certain visual features evocative of the Cāḷukya 
past, explicit expressions of the esoteric religious vision of the medieval period did not figure 
among their chosen patrimony.638 
638 A major argument of Richard Eaton and Phillip Wagoner, Power, Memory, Architecture: Contested Sites on India’s Deccan Plateau 1300-1600 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014) is that the Hindu-Muslim encounters of the early modern period need to be understood not as a clash of religions, but in terms of the complex interactions of two cultural and literary styles, that of Vijayanagara, nominally Hindu, and Sufi-inflected Persianate discourse of the Bahmani state, both of which sought to lay their claims upon the preexisting built landscapes that defined Deccani identity through its relation to the past, a past which included the cultural patrimony of the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas as well as the Kākatīyas of Telangana. In this spirit, both authors point us towards what they argue was the respectful reusage of older early medieval material culture by later Deccani rulers who were both Hindu and Muslim. 
Should you search scarcely a mile 
outside of the center of the modern town 
on the banks of the river, however, the 
avid explorer encounters two relatively 
intact Cāḷukya-period ritual and cultural 
centers, now called Shivapuri and 
Narayanpur. As the historian and 
epigrapher Dr. R. Shadakshariah of 
Dharwad University argues in his 
forthcoming monograph, unpublished 
inscriptional evidence suggests that the 
latter site in particular was the location of the main Cāḷukya palace. Fort at Basavakalyana: Some examples of creative reuse. Notice that in the second image a standing figure has been mutilated.

659 
The ruins of the temple at Shivpuri lie alongside the bank of a small lake, the typical 
site prescribed by the Śākta Tantras for the construction of the type of small-scale goddess 
shrine that was the standard locus for esoteric worship. The central focus of worship, quite 
possibly the first image on the top left, appears to have been an emaciated ten-armed form of 
the goddess, vaguely reminiscent of Cāmuṇḍā. An unpublished inscription dredged up from 
the lake at Narayanpur, currently being edited by Dr. Shadakshariah not only identifies this 
deity as the clan goddess of the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas, but, for probably the only time in the 
inscriptional corpus, actually incorporates a relief image of an esoteric emaciated goddess on 
the top portion of the stela. 
In nearby Narayanpur, within the shattered remnants of an important ritual complex, in 
place of the expected image of Gajalakṣmī, over the door lintel we find this ferocious fanged 
goddess, regal, heavily armed, and big bosomed, framed on all sides by guardian Bhairavas. 
660 
Scattered around the surrounding region in the open air, in what was once the maṇḍapa and 
garbhagṛha, lay several important images. Of particular interest are the figures we see below. 
Rather gentle in appearance, but the nonetheless seated on a corpse, the importance of this 
figure to the liturgical life of the complex is confirmed by its repetition, sans corpse, on a basalt 
shrine still in situ in an otherwise completely renovated shrine roughly to the northeast of the 
ruins of this temple. The significance of this placement in space is effectively inseparable from 
the actual identity of the deity. As we shall see in the next chapter, the exact nature of this 
mysterious figure has considerable implications not only for understanding the precise nature 
of the religious sensibility installed within the Cāḷukya ritual capital but more broadly for 
making sense of the practical dimensions of the social and institutional realities that animated 
the Kālamukha inflected Deccan. 
Two images of the same for now unidentified deity, to be analyzed in the next chapter, from Narayanpur. 
661 
All that remains of this Cāḷukya goddess temple is the doorframe and lintel images. 
Narayanpur today is renowned for the “Śiva temple” that lies just to the east, an 
impressive structure that still operates as a living focus of worship, whose exterior is adorned 
with life-size images of seemingly secular women in various stages of undress.

Despite its contemporary Śaiva associations, as a closer examination of its subtle iconography 
demonstrates, this too was originally a temple dedicated to the mothers.

In Power, Memory, Architecture. Contested Sites on India's Deccan Plateau, Richard 
Eaton and Phillip Wagoner have suggested, seemingly on the basis of a relief image of 
Narasiṃha that adorns the stair way leading up to the temple, and some stray comments in 
Bilhaṇa’s mahākāvya, that the site we have been exploring is indicative of a shift in affiliation 
among the later Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas towards an expressly Vaiṣṇava milieu. As we have already 
663 
seen, this hypothesis639 is not borne out by a close reading of the visual archive in situ, but had 
we any remaining doubts, they would more than alleviated upon entry into the temple’s 
interior. Once inside, the viewer is confronted by two types of images. On the one hand, affixed 
to the pillars are two exceptionally beautiful “secular” renderings of the female form. 
Narayanpur: Interior of the “Śiva” temple of the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya emperors. 
639 Much of Wagoner’s and Eaton’s confusion seems to stem from a leap of logic grounded on what is initially a rather sound conclusion, namely, their insightful recognition that both Bilhaṇa and Vikramāditya VI himself deliberately homologize the Cāḷukya kings with Rāma. This detail our authors then take as indicative of Vaiṣṇava commitments. In the early medieval period, however, as we see as late as the thirteenth century in Tamil Nadu in the writings of Kampaṉ, veneration of Rāma is most commonly aligned with Śaiva commitments. Following this train of thought, however, Wagoner and Eaton (pg. 11–13) decide that what is now called “the Śiva temple” was in actuality Vikramāditya VI’s temple of Viṣṇu Lord of Kamala, whom they take to be the kuladevatā of the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya kings. As we have seen in chapter 4, however, Someśvara III himself tells us that his grandfather’s kuladevatā was Svacchandabhairava and that his father was an adept initiated into a Śākta cult of the yoginīs. As we discussed in the beginning of this chapter, Someśvara III’s elder brother commissioned a temple with a base encircled by sixty-four yoginīs, and as we shall observe in passing, his successor’s coronation took place in tandem with a temple dedicated to Mahābhairava. 
664 
On the other, crudely stuck down into the concrete, one finds more than a dozen images, mostly 
of standing Bhairavas, emaciated goddesses, or dancing naṭeśas. 
Interior of “Śiva temple,” Narayaapur, details. L: Caṇḍikā. R: Gallery of images, from right to left, three Bhairavas, the middle one is dancing, Caṇḍīkā, and, on the left, dancing Naṭeśa with khaṭvāṅga. 
Mostly standing around three feet tall, it is almost certain that the majority of these images 
were not originally housed in their present location. Nevertheless, simply the sheer destiny of 
representation tells us something significant about the landscape surrounding long ago 
Kalyāṇa, which must have been simply saturated with such figures, rendered not only in stone, 
but in the much preferred mediums of clay, wooden, and precious metals. In contradistinction 
to an older logic where such figures and the often macabre sensibility they instantiated were 
only installed on the edge of social reality in special designated spaces that unapologetically 
proclaimed their commitments to those granted entry into the carefully demarcated domain, at 
Kalyāṇa, the “public” face of these temples offer extravagant sensuous presentations of a 
seemingly “courtly” idiom, instantiated in the repetition in space of the bodies of beautiful 
women, who present themselves to the viewer either heavily adorned in jewels or in a state of 
665 
nature. All the while, even on the outside, in the margins, along the borders—even, as we shall 
see in the next chapter—through forms of visual śleṣa, Śākta systematicities are being hidden 
in plain sight. Even if one gains entry into the more select environs of the interior of such a 
temple, visual representations of the esoteric deities remain distinctly muted when compared 
with the older register we saw at Ellora. To speak of this as a simple domestication, in the sense 
of a taming, of wild goddesses and their consorts of the sort that will be far more in evident 
subsequent centuries is misguided. The gods have not been made docile; they have just become 
cosmopolitan, adapting themselves like any good city dweller to inhabiting a variegated social 
arena abounding in diverse sensibilities.640 
As we have been seeing through visual representations whose iconographic regularity 
borders on monotony, a narrow band of shared visual signifiers invoking a much more deeply 
rooted and conceptually variegated panoply of Śākta traditions saturated the medieval Deccan. 
As we have begun to recognize, the use and reuse of the same sorts of imagery as platforms 
onto which an initiated adept might project his pantheon places significant limits on the 
analytical power of iconographic analysis, beyond its capacity to identify domains where 
esoteric Śākta practice of some sort has been thoroughly institutionalized and to distinguish 
them from those where no such cues exist. In much the same way that, when one is trying to 
sell a house, a broker will recommend the removal not only of personal items, but elements 
that communicate a particular use for a given space, so that potential buyers can more easily 
envision a multiplicity of arrangements that meet their own needs, icons and the spaces that 
house them often seem to be designed specifically for repurposing over the longue durée as 
640For an example of such analysis pertaining to later centuries, see, for example, Annette Wilke, “Śaṅkara and the Taming of the Wild goddesses,” in Axel Michaels, Cornelia Vogelsanger, and Annette Wilke, ed., Wild Goddesses in India and Nepal (Bern: Lang, 1996), 123–178. We will explore this trope in much greater detail in chapter 7 in our exploration of the material culture specific to Maharashtra and its continuities and divergences from the Cāḷukya mainstream. 
666 
well as context-specific multifunction use. Highly differentiated icons and temples are thus 
something like white elephants, only of relevance and interest to a very specific and narrow 
band of potential users. Thankfully, there are other more productive approaches to thinking 
with images. In contrast to svayambhū liṅgas, mūrtis do not just rise up spontaneously out of 
the ground. Like any craft, they are the product of specific communities of highly skilled 
artisans locateable in lived space. If the theology of images often seems somewhat murky, the 
sociology of images is less likely evasive. Though an exhaustive study of the relevant corpuses 
will have to await another occasion, even if in a cursory manner, we can begin to track stylistic 
choices along with the masons’ marks and signatures produced by individual artist. 
Additionally, through engaging both unpublished and neglected textual resources, we can 
begin to reconstruct some of the ethos that animated an essentially finite pool of craftsmen. 
In this endeavor, the material traces found around Basavakalyana at Shivpur and 
Narayanpur provide us with additional assistance. Here, it is not the subjects being depicted 
that are of interest, but rather the style in which the figures have been rendered. With their 
rounded cheeks, solid arms, and curvaceous bodies, the images at Kalyana adhere to the 
recommendations made by Someśvara III himself in the Manasollāsa that images should be 
“pleasing to the eyes, and somewhat plump.”641 
641 Prefiguring our focus in chapter 6, the complete passage begins by alluding to several sources for the conventions used by artisans when crafting images, including the Piṅgalāmata, before moving on to stylistic features. Mānasollāsa 1.76–78: viśvakarmamatenāpi mayaśāstrānusārataḥ / matsyaproktavidhānena piṅgalāmatamānataḥ // kalitena pramāṇena puruṣārthacatuṣṭayaṃ / kārayed devatāgāraṃ maṭhān bhaktyā mahīpatiḥ // navatālapramāṇena vidhānena samanvitāḥ / pratimāḥ kārayet pūrvam uditena vicakṣaṇaḥ / sarvāvayavasaṃpūrṇāḥ kiñcitpīnāt dṛśoḥ priyāḥ // 
667Narayanpur: Outside of Śiva temple. Details of three images. 
Fifteen miles to the east in the vicinity of Latur—the southernmost part of the 
Marathawada—the tiny remote village Ramling Mudgal abounds in images with strikingly 
similar features to the ones we have seen near Kalyāṇa. Though this village has never been the 
subject of academic study in any language, the existence of a least six temples as well as its 
comparatively enormous collection of images, perhaps as many as a hundred, to say nothing 
of the several large unpublished śāsanas scattered around the village are indicative of the 
importance of the place. That whole runs of images, which were clearly crafted at the same 
time, repeat an identical iconographic program, including more than two dozen figures of 
Umāmaheśvara—typically encountered as isolated forms—as well the fact that a number of 
the images appear to be partially unfinished, suggests the possibility that during the Cāḷukya 
era, this village served as a key artisans’ workshop patronized by the Cāḷukya capital. This 
668 
hypothesis is lent further support by two other rather unusual features of the landscape. 
669 
Ramling Mudgal: 
1) Umāmaheśvara with mātuluṅga and khaṭvāṅga. 2) Dancing 
emaciated goddess. 3) Mahālakṣmī, the Kaula goddess of Kolhapur, headless. 4) Maheśvara 
seated on bull with mātuluṅga.

671 
Ramling Mudgal: Umāmaheśvara with deer. 
Today among people in southern Marathawada from certain caste communities, 
Ramling Mudgal is remembered primarily for its samādhis, the earliest of which seems to date 
from the Cāḷukya period and the last of which was established in the mid-1980s, when the last 
yogin associated with this tradition appears to have left his body. Near the Rāṣṭrakūṭa-period 
temple now called Magadeva at the entrance to the village, one finds four particularly 
impressive Peshwa-period jīvansamādhis. At least three of these, a certain Devajī, his 
successor Nāganāthjī and Nāganāthjī’s disciple, whose name the elderly women pilgrims 
visiting in the village to pay their respects apologized for forgetting, belong to a lineage of 
siddhas, all sonārī goldsmiths, revered at once as both miracle workers and caste gurus 
throughout the region.

If such sites of memory and the still lingering religious communities they have until recently 
produced represent a chapter that marks the end of this part of Ramling Mudgal’s past, the 
village also presents us with ample—indeed, in an understated fashion, downright 
673 
spectacular—indications of that story’s opening chapters. 
Ramling Mudgal: Unique images depicting artisans, with guild sigil of chisel and a chattra, indicative of an elevated status. Some of the iconography prefigures the early modern Viśvakarman. 
Presenting themselves at a range of scales, from miniatures to around three feet tall, we find at 
least twenty such representations at Ramling Mudgal offering slight variations on a figure that 
seems to have no analogues anywhere else in the medieval Deccan of the twelfth to thirteenth 
674 
century. The figure is bearded, seated either in padmāsana or lalitāsana, and bears a japamālā 
in the right hand and kalaśa or other sort of vessel in the other. Alongside the larger 
representations, one finds the unmistakable sigil of the artisan castes, especially stone carvers, 
though it is possible these have been engraved into the stone by a different hand at a somewhat 
later date. Apart from the fact that these figures have only two arms, the images at Ramling 
Mudgal bear a strong resemblance to the early modern mūrtis fashioned to represent the god 
Viśvakarman when he assumes the role of patron deity of the artisan castes. 
Two equally compelling possibilities present themselves. The first is that images like these 
served as key formative antecedents drawn upon by the early modern tradition of Deccani 
artisans that in subsequent generations codified the representation of Viśvakarman. If this is 
the case, instead of standing in for a god who, though certainly present as a trope in the 
medieval Deccan, had yet to become central to the religious imaginary of Deccani artisans, 
these images originally bore some different significance. In light of the distinctiveness in the 
rendering of the individual facial features of each image, perhaps they were even originally 
intended as portraits of specific artisan yogins. Alternatively, two-arms notwithstanding, these 
may well be the oldest representations Viśvakarman on the subcontinent where he is presented 
not as merely an element in a narrative panel, but as a focus of worship. 
Regardless, both interpretations gesture in the direction of a largely unnoticed emic 
understanding with deep historical roots in which technical craftsmanship was virtually 
inextricable from the practice of yoga and founded on the values of the Śākta Tantras. In the 
next chapter, drawing on unpublished pratiṣṭhā texts in circulation within the world that the 
Cāḷukyas —or more to the point, the artisans they employed—shaped and made we will come 
face to face with just such an insider’s view—approximating some part of the self- 
675 
understanding of the very sort of people that have been captured in stone at Ramling Mudgal. 
But before we return to looking out at their world through the lens of some rather peculiar 
texts, we should reflect more critically and precisely about the conditions of possibility behind 
the archives we have used so far to begin to evoke something of the greater Cāḷukya milieu of 
the medieval Deccan. With the telling exceptions of the ephemeral chancellery culture we 
encountered in chapter 2 and the compositions of the Cāḷukya King Someśvara III himself we 
encountered in the last section of chapter 4, all of our evidence bears the distinctive mark of 
this artisan culture. 
Every inscription we have examined was inscribed, if not composed by such people. 
They are the authors of every social space depicted in our texts, from the courts where legal 
cases were tried to the temporary wooden pavilion where Āvahamalla misguidedly attempted 
to offer elaborate dāna to secure an heir. If we imagine the institution as impressive buildings, 
then this is the pool of talent that designed and constructed them. If we define an age by its 
inspired aesthetic style, in this case some of the most evocative representations of human like 
forms in stone in the history of art, then these are our geniuses. Even in purely materialist 
terms, if one’s conception of what underwrites a culture is its economic system, then these are 
the very people who mint the coins and thus manage the money supply. In short, from whatever 
angle we might approach it, when we study the early medieval Deccan, by necessity—for this 
is what we have left—we move through a world almost entirely shaped by a single social 
demographic that till now has largely evaded the purview of scholarship.

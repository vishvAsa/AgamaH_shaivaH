Chapter 1, “Defamiliarizing the Brāhmaṇical World,” questioned the long-standing tendency 
to treat conceptual frameworks like “Brāhmaṇism,” “Brāhmaṇical identity,” and “Brāhmaṇical 
ideology” as trans-historical categories with a fixed and immutable content—as opposed to 
ones that are historically and geographically contingent, internally contested, and constantly 
and often self-consciously evolving. On the basis of engagement with a wide range of primary 
sources from the classical period, we began to disaggregate “classical Brāhmaṇism,” revealing 
a range of competing tendencies and social and epistemological visions—different ways of 
1958 
“Being Brāhmaṇa”—already present within Sanskrit discourse. In particular, much as Dvivedi 
had suggested, an empiricist “Indian way of knowing,” encapsulated in the dictum that one 
should proceed according to context or circumstances—yathāsthāna—proved to be as integral 
to elite Sanskrit knowledge traditions as the more familiar programmatic vision of human 
action being guided by injunction (yathāvidhi), where theory as envisioned by elite Brāhmaṇa 
pandits supposedly always proceeded practice. Moreover, unlike their prescriptivist 
counterparts, these equally elite conceptualizations of rules and meaning as context-, 
discipline-, and community-specific proved to be deeply dialogical with the working 
presuppositions that also animated non-elite social realities and the quotidian experience of 
everyday life on the subcontinent. 
Through close and careful reading and source criticism, we called into question many 
of the major evidentiary pillars that have been presumed to support an emplotment of Indic 
history that identifies the Gupta era as defined by the full-blown emergence of an irreducibly 
theistic mode of Brāhmaṇical religion, articulated in the idiom of śāstra, monopolizing 
resources, wedded to state power, and that ascribes a pastoral and disciplinary role to 
Brāhmaṇas while granting them a monopoly in the domain of religion. We also examined how 
the projection of an invariant “Brāhmaṇical ideology,” where Indic social theory and the 
operation of disciplinary power is wholly conflated with the ideological apparatus of 
varṇāśramadharma, to the detriment of responsible social history, serves to occlude a range 
of other emic discourses reflecting on the nature of social reality along with the other highly 
pertinent modes of disciplinary power evident in particularized historical archives. Towards 
this end, we attended to a widely shared, and unduly neglected, emic conceptualization found 
throughout a range of classical sources about the transactional nature of an extra-śāstric social 
1959 
world and the problematic mutability of socially constructed identities that are product of 
particular regimes of pedagogy and conditioning. Our inquiry then took as its guide shared 
reflections and anxieties found throughout classical śāstra about institutions and paradigms of 
Indian sociality that are extra-śāstric, where legitimate authority is determined by documentary 
records, not scholastic norms, a realm where it is not the pandit or the poet but the scribe and 
the corporation who are the holders of institutional memory and the adjudicators of norms. As 
we saw, especially in combination with the embrace of the guiding principle that values and 
standards are site- and community-specific, these epistemic frameworks and social practices 
held significant implications for determining what makes someone a Brāhmaṇa, or more 
generally, a source of authority. 
Ironically, one of the consequences of recognizing the pervasiveness of site- and 
community-specific norms—that this pluralist episteme is deeply imbricated in the intellectual 
and religious life of the first millennium of the Common Era—is that the conceptual object we 
call “Brāhmaṇism,” whose content we treat as a set of perennial persistent norms operating 
outside of history, itself cannot help but become pluralized. And when pre-colonial social 
history is no longer read as the story of moments of passing resistance against the fixed, 
uniform, and unchanging canon of oppressive Brāhmaṇical normativity, what begins to emerge 
is a representation of Indian premodernity that is neither hagiography or polemic, but that 
represents religious and social change on the subcontinent in a manner attuned to the messy 
particularity that define fleeting human lives lived out in specific historical circumstances. In 
fact, it is only after we engage in this process of pluralizing Brāhmaṇism and the legal and 
social world in which it was entangled that we are really in a position to capture the contours 
of those historical moments in which something like what we have imagined as a hegemonic 
1960 
Brāhmaṇical Hinduism comes to dominate a particular regional and historical episteme, as we 
will see in the final chapters. 
Chapter 2, “A Beginningless Transactionality: Recovering the Quotidian Institutional 
Realities of the Early Medieval,” acclimated us to the diffuse application of disciplinary power 
within everyday life on the subcontinent by introducing us to the wonderful world of 
premodern paperwork and the variety of institutional spaces within which it circulated. From 
slave contracts, to bills of sale, to instructions given to paid labor, from property deeds, to love 
letters produced on spec and thank you notes for visiting dignitaries, we quickly recognized 
the rhetorical and conceptual continuities of this transactional realm full of non-elite social 
agents with the idioms of the Sanskrit cosmopolis, generally viewed as circulating within much 
narrower networks largely restricted to twice-borns. A similar consonance in textual format 
and content again speaking to a rather greater degree of diffusion of these norms was also 
recognized in regard to the evidentiary dimensions of an Indian courtroom, where the 
testimony of witnesses is recorded verbatim and then transmuted to fit the demands of elite 
discourse. The chapter also introduced us to what would become one of the methodological 
mainstays of our investigation, namely, that by thinking about the workmanly dimensions of 
textual production in highly formalized genres where composition involves the use of 
templates, and surveying a range of analogous texts or material objects that are the product of 
the same kind of production process, we can begin to identify the deliberate choices and 
insertions being made by specific social agents as they adapt inherited forms in the service of 
very specific localized aims. The chapter concluded by suggesting how such a method can be 
applied to thinking with documentary records composed in old Kannada, which offer us an 
even richer presentation of early medieval quotidian social and institutional realities. 
1961 
Chapter 3, “The King Must Protect the Difference: The Juridical Foundations of Tantric 
Knowledge,” shows us how mechanisms for juridical pluralism native to the Brāhmaṇical 
Dharmaśāstras themselves recognized the legitimacy, within certain spatial constraints, 
especially the sovereign land grant, of specific communities having their rights adjudicated 
and their transgressions punished by representatives who are members of an administrative 
incorporated body drawn from within the community itself. Not only are such representative 
agents granted the authority to make these decisions, but, drawing upon their own canon of 
entextualized codes of conduct, they are to do so in alignment with community-specific norms. 
Such a framework provides the conditions of possibility for the capacious religious and 
epistemic pluralism that comes to define the early medieval Deccan. Even more specifically, 
it is this tacit acceptance of “difference,” vigorously defended by political authorities, that 
allows for the widespread institutionalization of explicitly Tantric social imaginaries. These 
traditions in turn produced entextualized accounts of their community-specific norms, crafted 
in a manner that renders them legible within the broader realm of juridical adjudication, which 
are then incorporated into Tantric revelation. Drawing first the time upon the unpublished 
eighth- to ninth-century Śākta-Śaiva Piṅgalāmata, a Pratiṣṭhā Tantra edited from manuscript, 
we looked at some concrete examples of these codes of conduct and in-community disciplinary 
procedures, which despite their often quite transgressive content formally replicate the 
evidentiary best-practices better known to us from their application within a Brāhmaṇical 
sabhā. Through offering close readings of what seems to be the only surviving work of 
scholastic commentary on a work of non-Brāhmaṇa Dharmaśāstra, the second half of the 
chapter introduced us to an emic juridical framework that explicitly presents itself as a 
comprehensive alternative to varṇāśramadharma, complete with its own mode of sociality, 
1962 
form of political economy, and political theology. A model was proposed for situating the 
emergence of the root text, the mid-sixth century Śivadharmaśāstra, within the wider political 
and social history of the subcontinent, which marks the transition into the world of the early- 
medieval. The chapter further began to make the case for the utter centrality of the 
Śivadharmaśāstra, whose palpable influence will be in evidence in every subsequent chapter, 
and its manifold reception, for arriving at a working understanding of the early medieval 
Deccan. Extending our engagement with the multiplicity of modes of power that defines the 
early medieval Deccan, chapter 4, “Living in the Śaiva Age: Three Embodied Encounters with 
Authority and Responsibility,” offers us extended prosopographical accounts of the 
professional and personal lives of three non-Brāhmaṇa authority figures. In each instance, we 
are offered vivid and surprising portraits of how epistemic and juridical pluralism, inflected by 
teachings drawn from Tantric and pre-Tantric Śaiva and Śākta-Śaiva value systems, shaped 
lived realities. We witness the religious awakening of a Śūdra big man participant in the 
military labor market, whose ancestors parlayed their involvement in extreme forms of Tantric 
ritual into a ticket out of untouchability, enabling their descendants to marry their way into 
hereditary non-Brāhmaṇa regional elite families. It is then this confluence of modes of 
influence that enables our protagonist to leverage his social connections in the service of 
expanding the Śākta-Śaiva power center overseen by his new Kālamukha guru. In the next 
case study, we examined the professionalization process of a Kālamukha pontiff as he seeks to 
balance his administrative commitments with his private life as a highly accomplished Śākta 
polymath and yogin. In the process, we were compelled to thoroughly reassess the Kālamukha 
religious imaginary and its immense institutional and economic footprint. What began to 
1963 
emerge are clear indications that in the early medieval Deccan, at least by the eleventh and 
twelfth centuries, Kālamukha communities, enacting forms of Trika, Krama, and Kubjikā 
worship, are integral sites for the transmission and performance of the Tantric Śākta canon, 
but that in practice these commitments seem to have been thoroughly entangled with site- 
specific modes of religious practice that reflect regional non-elite religious cultures. In our last 
case study, we turn to the biographical and autobiographical reflections of the Kalyāṇī Cāḷukya 
emperor Someśvara III. As rebuttal to Bilhaṇa’s much more famous kāvya, which filtered the 
values and life-worlds of the early medieval Deccan through the normalizing lens of 
conventional literary tropology and Brāhmaṇical normativity, Someśvara’s prose presents his 
family history so that it reflects the eclectic pluralized cultural and religious idiom of the 
Deccan, emplotting a story of how his grandfather wrestled with the conflicting demands of 
the prescriptions of the orthoprax Dharmaśāstrins and his own Śivadharmaśāstra-inflected 
Śaiva commitments, at first choosing the former with disastrous consequences before finally 
finding sanctuary and new hope through devotional surrender to Śiva. The chapter then 
concludes by presenting evidence that Someśvara III's father, the illustrious Vikramāditya VI, 
whose fifty-year reign represents the defining moment in the history of the early medieval 
western Deccan, was an avid and unapologetic participant in the cult of the yoginīs. 
With chapter 5, “A Substantive Intervention: Reading the Material Culture of the 
Western Deccan across Region and Dynasty,” we extended our purview to the study of material 
culture and landscape, all the while continuing to attend to similar methods and conceptual 
focuses, such as a deep concern with epistemic pluralism as manifested in everyday life, the 
place of Tantra within diversified Deccani life-worlds, and a methodological commitment to 
reading out intentionality from corpuses of formally analogous cultural artifacts by attending 
1964 
to the places where they diverge from their template. Initially, we demonstrated how the temple 
culture that emerges during the reign of Vikramāditya VI enacts in stone the experience of 
inhabiting a pluralized episteme shaped by Tantric commitments, wherein each focal point 
constitutes a self-contained world and the esoteric and exoteric are situated right next to each 
other in a dynamic, unresolveable tension. In the second section, through surveying the 
changing placement and conceptualization of the deity Bhairava and his relationship with royal 
power, we took in the wider landscape of the western Deccan and the development of its highly 
specific mode of material culture. This in turn prepared us for a series of encounters with the 
material components and iconographic features of the institutionalized religious cultures of the 
Kālamukhas, which were shown to be pervasive features of the lived landscape present even 
in the very heart of elite Kannadiga literary culture. This visual and conceptualization 
vocabulary then enabled us to make sense of what remains of the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya capital in 
and around what is now Basavakalyana. 
In chapter 6, “Art and Terror in the City of Śiva: Śākta Artisan Imaginaries and the 
Making of a Material World,” through reconstructing artisan imaginaries, we shifted our focus 
from understanding the built landscape of the Deccan to recovering the life-worlds of the types 
of social agents responsible for its construction. First, we recovered accounts of artisans, called 
śilpins or kārukas, acting as yogins and making use of Tantric ritual technology within a 
formalized system of guild apprenticeship where they were under the guiding authority of their 
Tantric ācārya. Then, by reading a wide array of Tantric discourses, especially doxographies, 
against the grain, we recovered a prehistory, extending back into pre-Tantric sources, of 
artisans as adepts within Śaiva-aligned systems of praxis with their own textual canons, 
pantheons, and conceptual concerns. These systems in turn form an important antecedent to 
1965 
elements now identified with specific Tantric transmissions, such as the Trika and Śaiva 
Siddhānta. It is these adepts, acting under the guiding directions of the Lākula and eventually 
Kālamukha lineages that become their initiatory and guild gurus, to whom we owe much of 
what remains of the documentary and material cultural record of the early medieval Deccan. 
By returning to the Piṅgalāmata, the culminating textual production of these earlier 
imaginaries, we are able to engage with both the pedagogy and theology that animated these 
communities, where acts of craft prove to be inseparable from acts of esoteric worship carried 
out in an epistemically pluralized world where meaning and rules are site-specific. With that 
understanding in hand, we tackled the Piṅgalamāta’s extraordinary account of the exoteric and 
esoteric dimensions of the institutionalization of a sovereign land grant and the building of a 
temple comes to us replete with a vivid and detailed account of Śākta-Śaiva practices of 
philanthropy and its maximally distributionist model of political economy. One dimension of 
this discourse of much broader interest in understanding the nature of community in the 
premodern Deccan is that the text is emphatic that these inaugural acts of institution building 
as well as their annual memorialization were incorporative of both initiates and the general, 
even non-Śaiva, public to whom concrete material benefits would be provided. Beyond the 
intrinsic interest of capturing something of the verisimilitude of a lived reality that was integral 
to Deccani imaginaries but has never been represented in Western scholarship, this case study 
also served as an important rhetorical foil for the markedly different prescriptive, Brāhmaṇical 
vision for the founding of a temple and the institutionalization of social space we will 
encounter in the ninth chapter, which the mid-thirteenth-century dharmanibandha, the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi, proffers as the replacement for long-established Śāiva and Śākta 
normativities. 
1966 
While our study had until this point been concerned with the more generalized religious 
and social imaginaries of the early medieval western Deccan that were the product of the wider 
networks of circulation associated with the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas, their vassals, rivals, and the 
religious and cultural institutions whose independence they defended, from chapter 7 onward, 
we narrow our focus more specifically to early medieval Maharashtra, seeking to isolate the 
sensibilities and values that were particular to this region so we can track their reformation in 
the wake of the reimagining of Brāhmaṇical normativity and the state-directed suppression of 
Tantric socialities and institutional cultural that is the defining feature of the second half of the 
thirteenth century. Belying general assumptions, especially within Marathi secondary 
literature, that the religious and social life-worlds of early medieval Maharashtra prior to the 
thirteenth century are basically unrecoverable, drawing on a combination of material cultural 
and folklore in which there is persistent and specific memory of the early medieval, chapter 7, 
“Remembering Medieval Maharashtra: The Early Seuṇa Yādavas in the World,” traces the 
emergence of a Maharashtra-specific mode of religiosity whose distinctive nature was 
recognized across the regions. This modality in turn provides us with a framework for making 
sense of the dynasty of the Seuṇa Yādava kings of Maharashtra, whose early history proves 
inseparable from their strong Śākta-Śaiva commitments and affiliation with Kālamukha and 
Kālamukha adjacent institutional networks. Through site studies, prosopography, documentary 
records, and a close reading of an unstudied but seminal work of old Marathi religious 
literature, chapter 8, “Śākta Cosmopolitanism: The Seuṇa Yādava Imaginary before Hemādri,” 
examined the values among the circles of affiliation that surrounded the last Seuṇa king, 
Siṅghaṇa II (r. ca. 1210–1246 CE), whose court was committed to Śākta cosmopolitanism. By 
re-embedding key documentary records in their institutional context, our analysis seriously 
1967complicated Christian Novetzeke’s model of a Maharashtra in the era before Cakradhar and 
Hemādri as defined by a Sanskrit-promoting “Brahminic ecumene.” Instead, the imaginary 
that emerged from our investigation was already multilingual and committed at almost every 
level to a variety of Śākta-Śaiva traditions that held a complicated if not downright oppositional 
relationship to caste-centric Brāhmaṇical normativity. The result was a detailed portrait of the 
institutional and religious realities of the Seuṇa court in the generation immediately before 
Hemādri institutes a sea-change in values deliberately engineered to sweep away these 
pluralized Tantric pasts. They are to be replaced by a universalizing vision of dharma in which 
the Brāhmaṇa Dharmaśāstrin is centered as singular locus of authority and disciplinary power 
within the realm of religion and culture. 
Our last three chapters are each dedicated to a comprehensive engagement with a 
different facet of the Seuṇa sea-change in the second half of the thirteenth century as it is 
articulated in the oeuvre of Hemādri, particularly in the various sections of the vast, unstudied 
Caturgacintāmaṇi and the equally seminal and neglected Muktāphala and Kaivalyadīpikā. 
Chapter 9 largely addresses how the Seuṇa reformalization of Dharmaśāstra deliberately 
articulates a new paradigm designed to undercut Tantric imaginaries and their lived realities. 
In contrast, chapter 10 takes up the vision of the universalization of dharma as theology and 
social philosophy, demonstrating at every step along the way its utter discontinuity with prior 
visions of “Brāhmaṇical normativity.” Finally, chapter 11 shows us how, in the Muktāphala 
and Kaivalyadīpikā, through a robust new theorization of bhaktirasa. Hemādri provides the 
conceptual mechanics for transmuting the Bhāgavata Purāṇa’s philosophy of devotional 
Advaita Vedānta into a program of praxis rendered accessible and appropriate for all different 
types of people. 
1968 
Chapter 9, “Universalizing Hindu Dharma: Hemādri and His Legacy,” recovered from 
the documentary and material culture record the untold story of how after the death of Siṅghaṇa 
II in 1245 CE, the existing social contract that had animated Deccani institutional cultures for 
hundreds of years is suddenly called into question. Through a series of case studies of 
institutional disruption, including an account of the eviction of the Kālamukhas of Kukkunur 
we encountered in chapter two and four, we examined the evidence for the implementation of 
a new regime of delimited juridical and property rights that placed the management of 
previously autonomous spaces under the watchful eye of new class of “Brāhmaṇa” legalist 
regulators. Effectively, this eliminates much of the economic, social, and political power of 
non-Brāhmaṇa religious agents. This real-world socio-political program was shown to be 
thoroughly consonant with the prescriptive conceptual project in the Caturvargacintāmaṇi 
calling for the universalization of dharma. With great self-awareness, Hemādri innovatively 
set out to articulate a new episteme that reimagines the scope, theoretical foundation, and 
contents of Dharmaśāstra while offering a set of pedagogical tools designed to rapidly 
professionalize a vast new cadre of Brāhmaṇa authorities to fill the newly crafted roles whose 
proliferation is mandated by his manifesto. Thus, in chapter 9, a specific historical account of 
on-the-ground social change finds its complement in a series of close readings of key portions 
of the published Dāna and Śrāddha Khaṇḍas, along with selections read from manuscript from 
the unpublished “lost” Tīrthakhaṇḍa and Pratiṣṭhā subsections. In examining different aspects 
of the prescriptive vision of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi, our particular emphasis in this chapter 
was on how each prescriptive vision related to the “real world” of the early medieval Deccan. 
In the service of this type of robust contextualization, in which making sense of text demands 
a recovery of context and not new-critical navel gazing, we returned time and again to a form 
1969 
of source criticism that closely attended to Hemādri’s use of inherited textual and conceptual 
resources by juxtaposing his “readings” with those of his antecedents, in a manner that 
rendered palpably evident the true scope of Hemādri’s subversive innovations. 
In contrast, with Chapter 10, “Why I am So Clever, Why I Write Such Excellent Books, 
and What I Did to the Gods: Hemādri Reimagines Brāhmaṇical Thought,” our attention shifted 
to making sense of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s reimagining of the world of Sanskrit śāstra in 
a manner that infuses Brāhmaṇical imaginaries with an effusive devotionalism and a strong 
commitment to Advaita Vedānta as a knowledge system. Our initial focus was on the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s iconoclastic theorization of a Dharmaśāstra discourse that abjures the 
centrality of the usual questions of the duties specific to particulars varṇas and āśramas, and 
in their place robustly theorizes a universal (sāmānya) dharma, whose general contours are 
applicable in all contexts and to which all human agents are subject. While in the previous 
chapter, we had focused on how this conceptual architecture is used to systematically 
delegitimize and dismantle the existing institutional and theological norms that organized the 
western Deccan while at the same time reshuffling the labor force in a manner that lead to an 
immediate redistribution of resources to the detriment of non-Brāhmaṇas, here we consider the 
theology of the universalization of a nascent Hindu dharma on its own terms. Envisioned as a 
form of ethicalized natural law in a manner that has precious few antecedents, the dharma 
theology of Hemādri places all human beings under the same shared norms, whose 
adjudication is conveniently confined to a new social agent, the Smārta Brāhmaṇa 
Dharmaśāstrin. 
At the same time, this increased theological orientation of a universalizing dharma 
discourse has substantial consequences for questions of soteriology. For the first time in the 
1970 
history of prescriptive Brāhmaṇical śāstra, Hemādri offers a vigorous and learned defense of 
the legitimacy of non-twice-born soteriological aspirations, promoting the centrality of a mode 
of liberative inquiry, albeit applied to a canon of internally diversified Purāṇic sources, that is 
structurally analogous and functionally equivalent to the processes in orthodox Vedānta. 
Thus, Hemādri emerges as the earliest recoverable articulator of some of the defining 
features of one of the more familiar “textbook” versions of “Hinduism,” namely, the apparent 
inclusion of all Indian subjects across caste lines and governed by the same religious authorities 
within an “enchanted” shared religious framework suffused with theistic devotional sentiment, 
which asserts that all varieties of Indian religious textuality express a single shared worldview 
and unitary intentionality deeply indebted to Advaita Vedānta. In substantiating this point, 
again using copious source criticism, we examined key portions of the Caturvargacintāmaṇi’s 
Vrata and Śrāddhakhaṇḍas, systematically demonstrating at each point along the way the 
marked discontinuity between Hemādri’s topical and conceptual concerns as well as his 
methodology and those of virtually all of his predecessors, a state of affairs rendered all the 
more clear when Hemādri’s positions are demonstrated to be either entirely absent from prior 
discourse or actively identified as pūrvapakṣas that fall outside of the realm of Brāhmaṇical 
knowledge and values. Our engagement with the Caturvargacintāmaṇi proper then concluded 
with Hemādri’s highly technical presentation of his theory of textuality, which situates the 
mode of knowledge production exemplified by the dharmanibandha at the center of Smārta 
tradition. The final portion of the chapter is dedicated to showing beyond a reasonable doubt 
that Hemādri’s robust commitments to viewing the discourse on bhakti and Vedānta as integral 
parts of what it means to be Smārta were not shared by his most immediate and recoverable 
predecessors, in this case, from twelfth-century Varanasi, which sees its own distinctive 
1971 
Brāhmaṇical renaissance invested in the project of promoting the genre of the 
dharmanibandha. 
Finally, chapter 11, “Staging Devotional Advaita in Thirteenth-Century Maharashtra: 
Possession, Poetics, and the Anxiety of Influence,” offered the first account of Hemādri’s 
Vedāntic theistic devotionalism as it is expressed in one of the earliest commentarial treatments 
of the Bhāgavata Purāṇa. The Muktāphala and its conjoined commentary, the Kaivalyadīpikā, 
is the foundational work of the discourse of bhaktiśāstra, and in it the theology of bhaktirasa 
to which so many early modern Vaiṣṇava traditions are deeply indebted finds its initial 
articulation. What this chapter aimed to make plain is that the main interpretive context for 
making sense of Hemādri’s theological commitments, as well as many of the key intellectual 
strategies and conceptual models integral to his articulation of bhaktiśāstra, arise from the very 
episteme of the Śaiva Age that he invested so much energy in discrediting and 
deinstitutionalizing. This chapter thus offered an introduction to the core arguments of 
Hemādri’s bhaktiśāstra, the Muktāphala and Kaivalyadīpikā, while also treating them as 
offering a sustained polemical and dialogical engagement with this preceding knowledge 
system. Departing from the working assumptions in the secondary literature that the 
Muktāphala and Kaivalyadīpikā are best understood as works of literary theory whose primary 
influences come from the realm of Sanskrit Alaṃkāraśāstra, we saw that Hemādri’s selective 
use of these materials is largely strategic. In actuality, for Hemādri, rasa theorization about 
devotional religion was not an end in itself but the means to a very specific end, namely, 
reframing affectively charged “direct religious experience,” which falls outside the scope of 
religion by injunction so that it ceases to be the provenance of an elite vested with special kinds 
of authority. This is to say, in the realm of this dharma discourse, bhakti becomes a 
1972 
universalizing social force precisely when the status “being a bhakta” ceases to index juridical 
difference or to correspond to social and material power within the transactional world. 
Our analysis continued with extended reflection on the substantive affinities between 
Hemādri’s epistemology, ontology, and devotional theology with contemporary and near 
contemporary discourses in old Marathi. What emerged from our explorations was an 
alternative localized history that speaks to the flourishing as the early medieval period drew to 
a close of a heavily devotionalized Deccani Vedānta growing out of older Śākta traditions. 
That this value system appears to have represented a widespread and popular theological 
tradition even in the absence of the hegemonical identification of Brāhmaṇical tradition with 
Vedānta as a knowledge system poses a serious challenge to our normative narratives about 
the Brāhmaṇization and Vedāntization of “popular” religion. Hemādri’s intellectual project as 
a Vedāntin in fact suggests that we begin to think seriously about the “popularization of 
Brāhmaṇical religion” as playing a pivotal role in the history of the elevation of Vedāntic 
traditions. The chapter concluded by looking at the sociological implications of Hemādri’s new 
bhaktiśāstra, in a manner that calls for a more general reappraisal of the concrete real-world 
implications of early modern Vaiṣṇava bhakti as a social form and its complex and occluded 
relationship to the life-worlds of the early medieval Śaiva Age.

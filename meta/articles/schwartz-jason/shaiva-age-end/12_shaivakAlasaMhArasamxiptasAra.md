Conclusion: Śaivakālasaṃhārasamkṣiptasāra 
We began our journey with some provocative questions posed in the early twentieth century 
by Hazari Prasad Dvivedi that attempted to make sense of Hindu law’s uneasy encounters with 
colonial modernity. Essentially, Dvivedi discerned that the discourse of Dharmaśāstra contains 
within itself two mutually exclusive models of legal reasoning. The first of these, which he 
prizes as an integral dimension of Indic thought, champions the universal application of a fixed 
set of principles and standards in a logically consistent manner throughout the human realm. 
In contrast, the second more pluralistic model of site- and community-specific norms— 
radically internally diversified in terms of its precepts, methods, and core commitments—from 
his perspective spinelessly abrogated “the rules” of well-ordered human existence to 
accommodate law and religion to circumstance and changes in context. 
Dvivedi accounted for this discrepancy with dharma discourse in historical terms, 
suggesting that the abandoning of the “original” ideologically and methodologically consistent 
theory of jurisprudence accompanied by a more general Indic flight from reason was the 
product of cultural trauma engendered by Islamic incursions. From this perspective, Dvivedi 
understands what he calls the “sthānīya ācāra”—or the practices of place—as the 
maladaptive response of Dharmaśāstrins as they are displaced from the center of Indian social 
life and come to dwell in the shadow of the more productive response to changing 
circumstances on the subcontinent epitomized by the rise of devotional religion. Writing at a 
moment of the burgeoning awakening of a nationalist consciousness, Dvivedi 
anachronistically viewed the valorization of localized norms with the domains of law and 
religion as both reflecting and engendering the type of political and social fragmentation that 
had rendered India ripe for foreign subjugation. Yet even amidst this tale of the loss of classical 
1956 
wisdom replaced by misrule, ruin and woe, Dvivedi identifies an admirable Indian protagonist 
whose vision prefigures the type of unifying, focused, comprehensive, and actionable 
worldview that is representative of Hinduism’s better angels, a guiding light whose example 
offers lessons for the new Indian century. This far-seeing innovator is none other than the 
thirteenth-century Maharashtrian Dharmaśāstrin polymath Hemādri Sūri, best known as the 
author of the immense dharmanibandha, the Caturvargacintāmaṇi. 
While attending to many of Dvivedi’s core problematics, we have charted a very 
different course. What we have discovered is that far from representing an expression of early 
modern trauma stemming from a hostile encounter with someone else’s cultural imaginary, the 
capacious context-specific legal pluralism that so troubles Dvivedi forms a part of the discourse 
on Dharmaśāstra from that discipline’s inception. Instead of being alien to Indic thought, the 
juridical pluralism of site- and community-specific normativities we have set out to recover is 
itself a reflection of a broader pluralized epistemic paradigm with its own longue durée history. 
In actuality, it is the drive to articulate a synthetic scholastic paradigm for “unifying” Indic law 
and religion that represents a second order phenomena with recoverable emergence within 
historical time on the eve of the Islamic encounter. What results is a radical reformulation of 
the relationship between what we label “law” and what we label “religion,” of the scope of 
Brāhmaṇical governmentality, and of the very nature of Brāhmaṇical identity. If in a 
personalist vein we must speak of “cultural trauma” or acts of historical forgetting, the 
epistemological rupture comes not from without but from within, and the episteme that 
becomes largely occluded was the pluralized site- and community-specific life-worlds of the 
early medieval. As Dvivedi rightly discerned, but did not understand, the primary author of 
this sea-change in values—of reformation almost two-hundred years before the Reformation— 
1957is none other than the singular, and almost completely unstudied polymath Hemādri, who from 
a position of power within the court of the Seuṇa kings of Maharashtra theorizes and then puts 
into practice the universalization of dharma. The story of his harnessing of śāstra in the service 
of deliberate interventions into the quotidian here-and-now is impossible without first coming 
to terms with the deeper history of the site- and community-specific nature of the medieval 
Deccani worlds into which he was born. 
For this reason, Ending the Śaiva Age: The Rise of the Brāhmaṇa Legalist and the 
Universalization of Hindu Dharma presented to the reader two intimately interrelated 
conceptual projects. We reconstructed the largely unfamiliar and often quite surprising site- 
and community-specific life-worlds that defined the early medieval western Deccan in all of 
their nuanced particularity, resituating them in a robust intellectual, social and material context. 
Then, we presented a concrete story, mediated by text, document, and stone, of how and why 
these lived realities were rendered mostly provincial and subaltern, making possible the 
centering of the more familiar Brāhmaṇical imaginaries of early modernity and the colonial 
era.

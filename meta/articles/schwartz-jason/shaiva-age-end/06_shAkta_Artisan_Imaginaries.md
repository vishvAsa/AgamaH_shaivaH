Chapter 6: Art and Terror in the City of Śiva: Śākta Artisan Imaginaries and the 
Making of a Material World 
A World Made Fit for Images 
As we have seen time and time again, as both social space and conceptual object, the Deccan 
was effectively defined by the translation—into text, praxis, and materiality—of very specific 
epistemological commitments that imagined the world as founded upon irreducible diversity. 
As this chapter will make clear, these acts of translation were very specifically the product of 
the life-world of the medieval artisans who quite literally built the Deccan, and about whom 
little of substance has been written. Our task in this chapter—through a sympathetic act of the 
imagination married to precise philological work—is to attend to the self-understanding of 
these social actors and to the institutional frameworks, especially matters of pedagogy and 
ritual professionalizations, that made them into the types of people seen as suited for carrying 
out their assigned social roles. In short, we will need to acclimate ourselves to what is entailed 
in being not the type of religious intellectual or functional authority who composes 
entextualized theoretical discourse, but the sort of craftsman or functionary who translates 
ideas into the building blocks that make up institutions. 
Since our intent is to make sense of the self-understanding of premodern social agents 
who saw no natural antimony operating between ritual and “real work,” simple recourse to 
Western social scientific models will hardly suffice. It is more productive, in fact, to begin by 
reflecting on the very difficulty this dichotomy—between worship and craft, between art and 
object—has repeatedly posed for Indologists and scholars of religion. A particularly 
constructive point of departure is the perspective on offer in The Aims of Indian Art, composed 
in 1908 by the great Sri Lankan polymath Ananda Coomaraswamy. In one of the first 
677publications of its kind, Coomaraswamy sets out to make the case to the general public within 
the English-speaking world that the material culture of the Indian subcontinent demands to be 
read not as mere archeological curiosity but as art in its own right, informed by an emic 
aesthetic vision: 
It is said of a certain famous craftsman that when designing, he seemed not to be making, but merely to be outlining a pattern that he already saw upon the paper before him. The true artist does not think out his picture, but ‘sees’ it; his desire is to represent his vision in the material terms of line and colour. To the great painter, such pictures come continually, often too rapidly and too confusedly to be caught and disentangled. Could he but control his mental vision, define and hold it! But “fickle is the mind, froward, forceful, and stiff; I deem it as hard to check as is the wind”; yet by “constant labour and passionlessness it may be held,” and this concentration of mental vision has been from long ago the very method of Indian religion, and the control of thought its ideal of worship. . . . These mental images are of the same nature as those the artist sees, and the process of visualisation is the same. Here, for example, is a verse from one of the imager’s technical books (the Rūpāvaliya): 
“These are marks of Siva: a glorious visage, three eyes, a bow and an arrow, a serpent garland, ear-flowers, a rosary, four hands, a triśūla, a noose, a deer, hands betokening mildness and beneficence, a garment of tiger skin, His vahan a bull of the hue of the chank.” It may be compared with the Dhyāna mantrams used in the daily meditation of a Hindu upon the Gāyatrī visualised as a Goddess. 
“In the evening Sarasvatī should be meditated upon as the essence of the Sāma Veda, fair of face, having two arms, holding a triśūla and a drum, old, and as Rudrāṇī, the bull her vāhan.” Almost the whole philosophy of Indian art is contained in the verse of Sukrācārya’s Sukranītisāra which enjoins this method of visualization upon the imager: “In order that the form of an image may be brought fully and clearly before the mind, the image maker should meditate; and his success will be in proportion to his meditation. No other way—not indeed seeing the object itself—will achieve his purpose. 
It cannot be too clearly understood that the mere representation of nature is never the aim of Indian art. Probably no truly Indian sculpture has been wrought from a living model, or any religious painting copied from the life. Possibly no Hindu artist of the old schools ever drew from nature at all. His store of memory pictures, his power of visualisation and his imagination were, for his purpose, finer means; for he desired to suggest the Idea behind sensuous appearance, not to give the detail of the seeming reality, that was in truth but māyā, illusion. For in spite of the pantheistic accommodation of infinite truth to the capacity of finite minds, whereby God is conceived as entering into all things, Nature remains to the Hindu a veil, not a 
678 
revelation; and art is to be something more than a mere imitation of this māyā, it is to manifest what lies behind.642 
Almost everything Coomaraswamy stood for—starting with his style and the cadence 
of his prose to say nothing of his worldview—is now deeply unfashionable. Indeed, were it not 
for the color of his skin, as the de facto co-founder of the modern Traditionalist movement in 
tandem with the avowed fascist René Guénon, with whom he corresponded regularly for more 
than a decade, Coomaraswamy is exactly the sort of figure whose oeuvre the Western academy 
would be inclined to consign to the ash heap of history. Instead of such overt condemnation, 
however, in the more recent literature that aims to recover emic understandings within the 
domain of premodern Indian art, Coomaraswamy’s arguments are typically treated with 
condescension—indeed, often ascribed to subsequent authors. Little or no concrete efforts, 
however, are directed at directly refuting the close readings of primary sources that undergird 
his position. 
Thus, for example, in her monograph The Theory of Citrasutras in Indian Painting, 
Isabella Nardi approaches the work of the craftsman with a diametrically opposed set of 
presuppositions. The study of art, she insists, should emphasize the technical and transactional 
facets of this livelihood, which is self-evidently divorced from the types of high-minded 
theological concerns and mystic pretensions that have been artificially imposed upon on it by 
modern scholars with Orientalist leanings. In essence, Nardi has written a full-length refutation 
of the communis opinion first articulated by Anand Coomaraswamy in seminal works such as 
The Aims of Indian Art. Curiously however, never once does she mention him by name. In his 
642Anand Kentish Coomaraswamy, The Aims of Indian Art (Camden: Essex House Press, 1908), 2–4. 
679 
place, she rapidly disposes of two surrogate straw men, Sivaramamurti and Lal Mani Dubey, 
who are advocating very similar positions. Nardi writes: 
It is quite possible to develop a clear idea about the conceptualization of the painter and his role, therefore, from the texts. He is described in a realistic way that accords to him a certain degree of independence. This point is overlooked by some scholars while attempting to prove that Indian art is transcendental, and in turn add words like meditation, yoga and contemplation in their interpretations of the texts. . . . 
A similar approach can be found in Dubey’s comment on the Aparājitapṛcchā. Bhuvanadeva, the writer of the Aparājitapṛcchā, observes that the process of painting presupposes the identification of the painter with the visible animate and inanimate world (ApaPr 224.18). Dubey however argues that: “The act of painter or artist is the act of a seer or a yogi who identifies subjects with the object. This art is contemplative or meditative.” . . . 
Sivaramamurti and Dubey therefore take advantage of a textual source to prove their ideas that the painter was a yogi. However, this position is not supported by the aforementioned textual evidence. . . . Textual and practical views on the painter do not reflect the ideas shared by scholars like Sivaramamurti and Dube [sic], who attribute to the painter the status of a yogī. This view appears quite frequently in secondary literature, but it is supported neither by texts nor by practice.643 
For Nardi, the very texture of premodern Indic texts on painting—with their 
painstaking measurements and highly technical artisanal focus—belies an obviously erroneous 
association with the discourse of yogins, which is assumed to be governed by a numinous 
transcendentalism ungrounded in any material particularity. Nardi’s analysis, as she readily 
admits, is informed by the time she has spent working with the professionalized painting 
communities in the vicinity of Nāthjī at Nathdwara in Rajasthan. These Vallabhite Vaiṣṇava 
devotees, as far as she has observed,644 eschew the ascription of any esoteric dimensions to 
their craft. While such a background understandably informs her selection of sources, 
643Isabella Nardi, The Theory of Citrasutras in Indian Painting: A Critical Re-evaluation of their Uses and Interpretations (New York: Routledge, 2006), 28–36. 644Such a perception may have more to do with her own self-presentation than the worldview of her informants. In my own conversations with Vallabhite devotees, an investment in subtle body yogas and mantra uccāraṇa among practitioners has seemed to be very much a part of the community’s lived religious experience. 
680 
especially her privileging of the likely late eighth-century645 Kashmiri Viṣṇudharmottara 
Purāṇa, to which she ascribes an unreasonably early date, it does not excuse her rather 
disingenuous belittling of Sivaramamurti’s and Dubey’s understandings of the discourse of 
Indian art. Itself essentially a refinement of Coomaraswamy, their position is dismissed in 
Nandi’s reading as entailing nothing more than the ad-hoc addition of “words like meditation, 
yoga and contemplation” to “their interpretations,” with the aim of attributing “to the painter 
the status of a yogī. . . a view. . . supported neither by texts nor by practice.” 
Such a somewhat derogatory, emphatic, and unambiguous characterization, especially 
in regard to readily available published sources, all but cries out for verification. Quite unlike 
in the case of the polymath Sivaramamurti, who articulates such a perspective from within a 
more synthetic curatorial framework, Lal Mani Dubey’s project—reporting on the contents of 
what is supposedly a twelfth-century treatise on art and architecture entitled the 
Aparājitapṛcchā, composed in early medieval Gujarat on the edge of the Deccan—is primarily 
documentary in nature. Thus, contrary to Nardi’s characterization in the passage we have just 
been reading, when we inquire whether early medieval artisan authors such as the 
Bhuvanadeva who composed the Āparajitāpṛcchā did or did not equate the “the act of painter 
or artist” with “a seer or a yogi who identifies subjects with the object,” we are not dealing 
with matters of argument but assertions of fact that can be readily confirmed or denied on the 
basis of their presence within or absence from the primary sources. One has only to turn in a 
645In his essay “Imperial Purāṇas” in Querying the Medieval (pg. 29–98), Ronald Inden has argued for a Kashmiri provenance for the Viṣṇudharmottara, placing its composition in and around the court of Muktāpīḍa Lalityāditya sometime in the seventh or eighth century of the Common Era. Inden was not aware of the considerable degree of intertextuality between the Viṣṇudharmottara and the non-Brāhmaṇical Viṣṇudharmaśāstra. Sanderson is inclined to place the composition of the text a generation later under one of Muktāpīḍa’s successors and perhaps in the region adjacent to modern Srinagara, but otherwise views the work as the product of a comparable historical moment.

681 
cursory fashion to the admittedly enormous and poorly edited text646 that informs Dubey’s 
writings to see that homologization of acts of cosmic creation and artisan sub-creation, of 
646The Aparājitapṛcchā is typically assumed to be a work of the twelfth century that was likely composed somewhere in Gujarat. This contextualization is based on three sorts of evidence, namely, 1) the existence of several citations from the work found in the mid-thirteenth-century Caturvargacintāmaṇi of Hemādri, 2) the presence of textual parallels in the Samarāṅgasūtradhāra ascribed to the twelfth-century Paramāra king Bhojadeva from which our work supposedly borrows, and 3) the purported reflection of building strategies represented in the text in the material culture of twelfth- through thirteenth-century Gujarat. At our current state of knowledge, given the hodgepodge nature of the present edition, only the first of these elements— demonstrating that some form of a text bearing this name with some parallel passages must have existed in the thirteenth century—can be taken at face value. In regard to the textual parallels found in the Vāstu texts ascribed to Bhojarāja, which are typically cited as evidence for the lower limit of the date of composition, prior to an assessment of the manuscript evidence we have simply no way of knowing the direction of the borrowing, which the literature simply assumes. It is just as likely that Bhoja’s paṇḍits knew some version of the Aparājitapṛcchā as the currently accepted alternative. The evidence from material culture is equally inconclusive, as the canon of eleventh-century structures, for example, were deliberately excluded from the comparative art historical project that arrived at this conclusion on the basis of a de facto assumption that the text could not be any older because it is assumed to borrow from Bhoja’s writings. As for the text of the Aparajitāpṛcchā, it can be assessed as unsatisfactory not merely in terms of the very high standards of modern text-critical Indology, but, by basically any standard, given that it transmits pages of gibberish, contains obvious interpolations, and simply abruptly stops long before reaching a conclusion. This sort of assessment is hardly original, but has been made many times before, including by its original editor. 
Thus, in the introduction to his Baroda edition of Aparajitāpṛcchā, the only published version, Popatbhai Ambashankar Menkad, a retired engineer, candidly writes: “I must admit that I am fully conscious of my incompetence to deal with such a technical subject, especially with the help of scanty materials I had to work upon. For nearly one-third of the voluminous work. . . I had to work out my way from one manuscript alone. . . . The manuscripts themselves were full of mutilations, interpolations and glaringly faulty phraseology scattered throughout the text; the continuity of the subject was broken at several places due to the fact that several stanzas either wholly or partially were missing in many सू+s especially where the subject-matter became highly technical. Even portions of the सू+s themselves had bodily got intermingled with other सू+s without any bearing on them.” Popatbhai Ambashankar Mankad, ed., Aparājitapṛcchā of Bhuvananadeva (Baroda: Oriental Institute, 1950), 2– 3. Working with only three manuscripts, from which he gives the occasional major variant, with the aim of producing a readable text, Menkad appears to have cleaned up and silently emended good portions of his source material, obscuring the actual readings to which he had access. Such adjustments have not managed to obscure the composite nature of the work, which seems to be written in several distinctive grammatical registers, including one strongly suggestive of either an Aiśa-tinged original or at least borrowings from such a source. Its authorship is variously ascribed to Bhuvanadeva, Bhavadeva, and Bhatrideva in Hindu Vāstuśāstra discourse. As Steve Vose has pointed out in conversation, among the Jains, who may have their own unpublished recensions, it is believed to be composed by Haribhadra. Intriguingly, at several places in his edition, Menkad documents instances where one of his manuscript sources attempt to replace ascriptions to this human author found within the text with attributions of the same phrases to the deity Viśvakarman. See, for example in the tālavāda chapter on page 793, the replacement of the reading in verse 10, tadanukramaṃ pravakṣyāmi bhuvanadevabhāṣitam with “. . . viśvakarmaprakāśitam.” 
The content of the work is equally heterogenous. Here again preliminary evidence suggests the work has undergone a redaction process that elevates the figure of Viśvakarman, here associated with the standard array of early modern Brāhmaṇical values, in a manner that conflicts with the doctrinal and ritual portions of the text, where this god has little prominence and such values are scarcely in evidence. The first nine chapters are particularly suspicious, for in them Viśvakarman, seated on Kailāsa, is presented as the source of the revelation 
682 
crafting and yoga—though it is not the intellectual focus of what amounts to a compendium of 
floor plans and iconographic schematics—is indeed a pervasive concern throughout the work. 
In other words, the technical and transactional facets of this livelihood that Nardi privileges 
are in actuality fully fused with the types of high-minded theological concerns and mystical 
pretensions she has dismissed as anachronism. 
Thus, for example, in offering a definition of the artisan and his social role, the 
Aparājitapṛcchā teaches us that the artisan, characterized as “a good worker” who “does the 
work of the master” adheres to the niyamas and is free from desires (niḥspṛha). At the same 
time, however, we are informed that the work of the artisan is said to be at every point suffused 
with the attitude that sustained meditations are what make possible acts of crafting. This is of 
course precisely the position Dubey had ascribed to the Aparājitapṛcchā, that Coomaraswamy 
had located in the Śukranītisāra, and that Nardi had dismissed as entirely unsupported by 
textual evidence: 
For so long as there remains prārabdha [karma], there is to be embodied meditation [by the artisan] [upon] the praiseworthy ones [i.e., the gods]. He should bring about that kind of a state (bhava) such as exists with regard to the gods. [Abiding] in the state of the gods by means of his own self (svarūpa), he is always established in the full state of being (pūrṇabhāva).647 
teaches a standard Purāṇic cosmology and inculcates varṇāśramadharma in a manner that never resurfaces in the next seven hundred pages. Indeed, the last several verses of chapter ten, which may well represent the original beginning of the text, finds us suddenly back of Kailāsa receiving a teaching revealed by Mahādeva that amounts to a crash course in a substitute Śākta-Śaiva tinged cosmology, centered around the union of Śiva and Śakti, that informs every subsequent doctrinal reflection found in the work and that is organically linked with the scanty ritual system prescribed. 
In the first and least complete volume of the NCC, already eleven manuscripts not consulted by the editor are listed, suggesting a wide distribution for the work. As is the case with all NCC entries beginning with A, consultation of the card catalogs preserved at the NCC project headquarters in Chennai, whose entries have continued to be updated throughout the twentieth century and include information from hundreds if not thousands of additional Sanskrit manuscript catalogs, will almost certainly yield additional sources. 647Aparājitapṛcchā 49.9–10, pg. 116: prārabdhaṃ tu bhaved yāvad tāvad vandyeṣu bhāvanā / tādṛśaṃ kārayed bhāvaṃ khalu deveṣu yādṛśam // devapāde svarūpeṇa pūrṇabhāve sadā sthitaḥ / 
683 
Much to our consternation, like most of the genre of Śilpaśāstra, the Aparājitapṛcchā 
is hardly a work that has much invested either in theological speculation or in explicating the 
social world of which it was a product. Like any other prescriptive technical treatise, it 
presupposes a particular audience already intimately familiar with the life-world of the 
profession under study and who would have already acquired their religious education from 
other sources. Now, as our earlier investigations—at Sirshangi for instance—have suggested, 
and the Aparājitapṛcchā itself will soon confirm, the content of this religious education was 
unmistakably Śākta in terms of its core outlook. As we will see, however, the mode of 
expression of this tradition as well as its pantheon align poorly both with the standard 
historicization of the evolution of Tantric textual discourses as well as with our modelling of 
the place of the practicing yogin—typically imagined as a renunciate—within the wider 
purview of Indic society. 
With the aim of beginning to remedy this sorry state of affairs, this chapter carves out 
a place—sociologically, doxographically, cosmologically, intellectually, and perhaps even 
phenomenologically—for the Deccani artisan as Śākta yogin. We will be especially attentive 
to what we can recover of the emic understandings current among such communities, as these 
diverge in interesting ways from our standard perceptions of the Tantric knowledge systems 
and their modes of knowledge production. We will be led to reassess the connections between 
particular modes of understanding and questions of livelihood as well as how the patterns of 
circulation and transmission of text and praxis constitute and circumscribe the types of 
exchange possible between communities. Perhaps most fundamentally, our inquiry will lead 
us to question the relationship the secondary literature has envisioned between the traditions 
of the Atimārga and the Tantric revelations that are viewed as simplistically superseding them. 
684 
Instead, by the end of this chapter, the two domains will emerge as deeply entangled, not 
merely with some of the most idolized transmissions in Tantric thought, but with the 
fundamental institutional structures that ordered the Deccan. 
In reconstructing the interrelationship between these domains, we traverse 
uncommonly byzantine textual terrains—often having access to mere fragments of key primary 
sources or having to collate together terse allusions to lost corpora—and at the same time, what 
actually survives is woefully under-documented. Indeed, the task before us is then something 
like having to reverse engineer the main plot of the Rāmāyaṇa and discern the nature of the 
genre of mahākāvya while simply possessing the name of Vālmīki, anthologized verses 
ascribed to a certain Kālidāsa, while relying primarily on a partial commentary on the 
Raghuvaṃśa that does not incorporate the verses of the root text. Succinctly, what we have 
here might justly be characterized as a hermeneutical mess. Nonetheless, by oscillating 
between close readings of particular passages from unstudied Śākta Śilpaśāstras and 
archaeological excavations of the social and scriptural environs these works presuppose, we 
will gradually be able to recognize at least the general contours of these important but neglected 
discourses as well as the bigger picture of how they speak to the social position of “Tantric” 
knowledge and its institutionalization in the early medieval world. 
What our excavation will unearth is not the earliest kāvya, but instead, nearly as archaic, 
a hitherto unrecognized artisan religious imaginary with its own ethos, specific pantheon, 
textual canon, and sociology of knowledge. As we will see, some of the key elements of this 
tradition include an esotericization of technical processes such that the crafting process itself 
becomes a part of religious praxis, a decidedly attenuated attitude towards questions of purity, 
as well as the veneration of a fierce chisel or axe wielding deity, often called Caṇḍeśvara, as 
685 
the supreme lord, who is then paired with a female counterpart, whose surface identity as a 
form of Sarasvatī conceals hidden chthonic depths. I will present perhaps all too extensive and 
certainly tediously technical evidence that the very existence of such a tradition was likely 
deliberately obscured as an integral part of the articulation of the more familiar tradition- 
specific Tantric canons of the classical Mantramārga. As we will see, as part of the fashioning 
of community-specific identities like Śaiva Siddhānta, the Bhairavasiddhānta, or the Trika, 
elements originating in this older proto-Tantric domain were disaggregated and then partially 
absorbed across a range of more familiar classical Tantric traditions. 
Our analysis will thus proceed from a number of angles. First, we will bring the 
evidence provided by the Aparājitapṛcchā into dialogue with a range of Śaiva and Śākta 
doxographies, cosmologies, and vernacular textualities in the service of recovering a discursive 
and social prehistory for the Śākta Śilpaśāstras. This task demands we reassess some of the 
more fragmentary evidence concerning the internal diversity of perspectives and modes of 
practice within Atimārga. Essentially, we will have to engage once again with the problem of 
hidden Lākula inheritances within the Tantric traditions, especially in relation to the Bhairava 
Siddhānta, en route to making sense of how the Lākulas themselves subordinated and then 
ultimately absorbed an equally Atimārgic sister tradition that seems to have called itself the 
Kāruka Siddhānta, and was intimately connected with artisan sociologies. 
Our analysis will then turn toward a close reading of the most significant works of the 
Tantric artisan corpus to survive, especially the largely unstudied and likely late-eighth-century 
Piṅgalāmata, which will serve as a touchstone to which we will return again and again as the 
chapter progresses. Having assigned a general context to this mode of textuality, by inquiring 
into mainstream śāstric discourses on the role of the śilpin, we will next begin to make sense 
686 
of the types of agents that would have been inculcated into these forms of knowledge, placing 
them into dialogue with delineations of the role of the śilpin as householder and yogin found 
within the Śākta sources. In reconstructing the virtually unstudied life-world of the Śākta 
artisan, we look at how professionalization, philosophical speculation, material culture, and 
pedagogy are understood to operate within these communities as well as how this mode of 
textuality responds to and encounters more familiar forms of Sanskritic discourse. 
Finally, having oriented ourselves to the life-world of the śilpin, through a close reading 
of a Śākta Śilpaśāstra’s treatment of pratiṣṭhā, we will examine both the pragmatics and 
political theology that govern acts of institutionalization within the medieval Deccan, at least 
from the perspective of some of the people we call Lākula Kālamukhas and their disciples. It 
is here that the careful and somewhat tedious philological work on Tantric taxonomies will 
bear fruit, for ultimately it will provide us a much-needed foundation for at last making sense 
of the shared doctrinal vision—bearing deep connections with the Śivadharmaśāstra and with 
concrete social implications—articulated across a range of what would otherwise seem to be 
disparate Śaiva and Śākta sources. Taken as whole, they call for a reappraisal of the social role 
of the Lākula traditions, as well as the other Atimārgic communities they absorbed, in the 
constitution of the values of the early medieval Deccan. 
Setting such lofty concerns aside for the moment, let us return to the Aparājitapṛcchā, 
a treatise on construction and design that offers our first window into the life-world of the 
Śākta artisan and its occluded deep history. Its author, perhaps named Bhuvanadeva, 
unapologetically held Śākta views, was an initiate into such systems, and prescribed 
acculturation in Śākta religiosity as a precondition for artisan professionalization. Such 
commitments explain why, in the Aparājitapṛcchā, wherever the sūtradhāra establishes 
687himself and his team at a new job site, the main pūjā performed entails the veneration not only 
of Gaṇanātha accompanied by Siddhi and Buddhi and the trimūrti, features we would expect 
regardless of precise affiliation, but also the propitiation—using “special substances”—of the 
guardian of the field, the yoginīs, the quintessential Kaula deity Baṭuka Bhairava, the goddess, 
and a Kumārī.648 In fact, the more than eight hundred pages of iconographic and architectural 
prescriptions frame as their centerpiece directions for building the largest image represented 
in the Aparajitāpṛcchā, a fifty-armed form of Svacchandabhairava who stands ten and a half 
feet tall. Once this gargantuan image of Svacchandabhairava as Rudra has been constructed, the 
text informs us, before the pūjā begins, the artisans must craft the eight Bhairavas. While this 
list of eight admits some variation, the Svacchanda Tantra, for example, mentions Svacchanda, 
Caṇḍa, Krodha, Unmatta, Asitāṅga, Mahocchuṣma, and Kapālīśa Bhairava.649 Rather tellingly, 
the last figure in this canon has had his originally independent worship absorbed into the 
tradition of the Picumata Brahmayāmala.

Note, however, that subsequent research, including by Dyczkowski himself, has revealed that the Nityāṣoḍaśikārṇava, here called NSA, whose doxographical list is privileged in the analysis, is not nearly as archaic as had been presumed, but in fact post-dates most Western Transmission discourse.

After the Bhairavas have been installed, the ācārya, here called sūtradhāra, wearing white 
clothes and observing a vow that restricts his intake of food, performs homa, measures and 
sprinkles the ground and then invokes a series of mantras650 into the tools used for crafting.651

In fact, the entire focus of this portion of the Aparājitapṛcchā, which is essentially on pratiṣṭhā, offers a concise treatment of the sort of materials we will explore in much greater detail at the chapter’s conclusion.

The master of ceremonies now distributes the dāna. The artisans (śilpins) are given clothing 
and ornaments and fed and then the same act is repeated, only this time things are bestowed 
upon Brāhmaṇas.655 The occasion for this ritual act is said to coincide with the bestowing of 
land (bhūmidāna), and we are told that “the work” (karma) of crafting images, during which 
the artisan makes material the image he is contemplating in his heart (yasya devasya yā mūrtiś 
cintayet tāṃ hṛdambuje), coincides with a fivefold festival (pañcamahotsava).656 The chapter 
then concludes with a reflection on the mantra system used by this community, to which we 
will return momentarily. 
In this eight-hundred-page text—which again offers schematics for crafting specific 
images and structural elements as well as canons of measurement—only several other passages 
in a similar vein reflect upon the specificities of artisan religious praxis that our text views as 
inseparable from acts of crafting. Even in its current fragmentary and garbled form, however 
the most vivid of these is rather tellingly integrated into the chapter dedicated to the worship 
of the goddess Sarasvatī (sarasvatyarcana). This chapter opens with what it calls the 
compilation concerning the essence of ritual initiation (dīkṣāsārasamuccaya). Unfortunately, 
the author of the Aparājitapṛcchā apparently does not believe that identifying the target 
653Appearing already in the Picumata Brahmayāmala and the Bhairavamaṅgalā, where he is represented as a well-known figure imported from somebody else’s tradition, Amṛtīśa Bhairava appears to be the predecessor to the more familiar Amṛteśa Bhairava, whose worship is discussed in Svacchandamṛtyuñjaya, more commonly referred to as the Netratantra. From his inception, this deity is already associated with a procedure (vidhāna) for the conquest of death and the cheating of time. This detail is intriguing, for as we shall see, Śākta doxographies associate that work with the same canon of texts used by the artisan castes. 654Aparājitapṛcchā 226.25–26, pg. 581: mantreṇa ṭaṅkikakāgraṃ ca sampṛśet / prajvalad vin[y]ased astraṃ ṭaṅkāgre sarvatomukham // amṛtīśaṃ hṛmyamdaye[conj. hṛdambuje?] nyasya astreṇojvalati tadā / 655Aparājitapṛcchā 226.27–29, pg. 581: śilpino bhojayet tatra vastrālaṅkārasamyutān / brāhmaṇān bhojayet tatra śuddhasainyaṃ tapasvinām // bhūmidānaṃ kuryād bhūtvā cā’kṛpaṇas tathā / samācaret karma tatra kṛtvā pañcamahotsavān // yasya devasya yā mūrtiś cintayet tāṃ hṛdambuje / 656As we shall see later, acts of crafting and the installation of images for a temple typically unfold over the course of five-day festivals, with the main rituals occurring on the last two days.

audience for initiation—are we talking about a general induction into the ranks of practicing 
artisans or some more specialized category of practitioner?—forms an “essential” part of his 
message. We are simply told that an ācārya, who observes his community’s ācāra in a 
disciplined manner (vinayācārasaṃyuktaṃ), who is skilled in all the śāstras, especially those 
associated with Vāstu (kuśalaṃ sarvaśāstreṣu vāstuvedodbhavādiṣu), who is attached to the 
worship of the feet of his guru (gurupādārcane ratam), and who worships god, fire, and guru 
(devāgnigurupūjāsu rataṃ), should initiate “the best of disciples” (śiṣyakottama). After a 
karmic and physical assessment has been made of the qualities of the student, this initiation 
takes place on the proper astrological occasion, within a monastery or a house (maṭhe ’thavā 
gṛhe) where, on the best of ritual grounds (vedikottama), an image of the goddess has been 
installed. 
Though she is called Kāmākhyā,657 iconographical and visual culture evidence suggest, 
more specifically, that the goddess in question is understood to represent at once Vāgdevī and 
Bhairavī. At the level of iconography, seated in a lotus posture with her “japamālā, vīṇā, book 
and kamaṇḍalu, blue throat, white arms, a white body, and a crescent moon,” she is virtually 
indistinguishable from the generic representation of the goddess Sarasvatī. Quite possibly tens 
of thousands of images of this sort survive from the medieval Deccan, and it has often been 
noted that this was perhaps the one time in the history of India prior to modernity when temples 
dedicated solely to the goddess Sarasvatī formed a common feature of the landscape. Virtually 
of these images are found in ritual centers associated with the Kālamukhas. 
657Intriguingly, the old Marathi Līḷācaritra, which offers an account of the life of the thirteenth-century Mahānubhāva saint Cakradhar, begins by describing his prior incarnation as a Gujarati king who, compelled by his office to connect with the goddess Kāmākhyā, instead commits ritual suicide. As we will see in chapter 9, Kāmākhyā installed in her seat at Kāmarūpa was understood in Western Deccan as abiding not in Assam, but in the Kāmarūpapīṭha at Prabhāsakṣetra in Saurasthtra at a site closely linked with the Śaiva pilgrimage center of Somanātha.

Further evidence confirming the identity of the goddess in question can be gleaned 
from the fact that the Aparājitapṛcchā offers us a brief but rare glimpse at a particular ritual 
practice, including a peek at the mantras involved. In this system, Vāgdevī/Bhairavī resides 
within the center of an eight petalled lotus within the bhadraka maṇḍala, surrounded it seems 
by Bhairavīs and kuladevīs. This central image in turn is embedded within a hexagon, known 
of as the void, and perhaps worshipped by six dutīs, though here the text is particularly 
unsatisfactory. Dressed in white clothes, the artisan is offered to the goddess, begs for her favor 
and propitiates her with the otherwise unattested mūla mantra.658 The śilpin then performs an 
aṅganyāsa [heart, head, tuft, armor, eyes, and weapon], each of which makes use of the 
standard Ś ākta bīja hrīṃ and much more obscure ā/āṃ. While, besides the use of āṃ, the 
obligatory veneration, found in almost any Kaula text, of Gaṇapati, Baṭuka Bhairava, direction 
deities, door protectors, and protectors of the field adheres to the standard pattern, the final 
mantra,659 which emphasizes the so called haṃsa bīja, is somewhat unusual and will warrant 
further reflection momentarily. In typically Tantric fashion, these mantras are enjoined to be 
repeated 100,008 times independent of ritual action, and then 10,008 more times in the context 
of a homa rite that makes use of materials from the ficus tree. 
Once all of this is completed, the disciple inscribes a message—the content is not 
specified—that corresponds to what must be written down whenever one commences drafting 
a painting. The guru then places his hand on the head of the disciple and proceeds with 
initiation. In place of the expected soteriological message—such as something to do with the 
severing of ontological bondage and the conferring of a new identity, however, in this text the 
658Aparājitapṛcchā 230.20, pg. 589: oṃ hrīṃ kauśinī pādān namaḥ / oṃ hṛīṃ upakeśinī pādān namaḥ / ā hrīṃ sarvakeśī pādān namaḥ / āṃ hrāṃ hṛīṃ sarasvatī pādān namaḥ // 659Aparājitapṛcchā 230.24, pg. 589: āṃ hrīṃ hrā hrīṃ hraṃ haṃsabījāya namaḥ / āṃ hrāṃ hrīṃ namaḥ / 
696 
guru simply proclaims in rather convoluted Sansrkit—avāpnuhi svakarmādisāmarthyaṃ 
tvaṃ—which basically boils down to “you have obtained the capacity to do your own crafting 
work,” a message akin to what one finds on those ever so cherished printed certificates issued 
as a matter of course following training courses on the modern subcontinent. To a modern 
sensibility, it is thus unnerving that what for us seems like a banal exercise in 
professionalization and credentialing is immediately followed by a paean of effusive 
devotional fervor. Declarations such as “the guru is mother, the guru is father, the guru is the 
god of the gods themselves, he is the cause of knowledge in this world and in the next”660 may 
be mainstays of Hindu devotion, but they take on very different significance when the context 
is that you have just completed orientation at work and the guru in question is about to become 
your boss on the job site. For the author of the Aparājitapṛcchā, however, what to us are 
divergent dimensions of human experience—call them the spiritual and the transactional— 
form a seamless unity, for after all this bhakti talk, the parts of the chapter that remain readable 
conclude by informing us that “the connection of disciple to guru enables the means to the 
production of craft (karma). From the connection of disciple and guru there is knowledge that 
is the very foundation of [the art] of painting.”661 
As this passage suggests, Tantric initiatory sociologies lay at the very heart of the 
Aparājitapṛcchā’s emic understanding of the act of making. And yet, lest we be tempted to 
simply read this sort of thing as a theologization obscuring concrete social relationships, 
consider sections explaining the origin of painting, where Aparājitapṛcchā continues on to 
articulates a distinctive, and yoga-inflected conception of the very relationship between the 
660Aparājitapṛcchā 230.27–28, pg. 589: gurur mātā pitā caiva devadevo gurus tathā // jñānakāraṇakaṃ caiva iha loke paratra ca / 661Aparājitapṛcchā 230.29–30, pg. 589–90: guroḥ śiṣyasya sambandhaḥ karmasādhanasādhakaḥ // guroḥ śiṣyasya sambandhād jñānaṃ vai citrabhūmikam / 
697painter and the world. Painting, we learn, is in fact the foundation upon which everything in 
three worlds is dependent (citramūlodbhavam sarvaṃ trailokyaṃ sacarācaram).662 It is the 
source of the sun, moon, and continents, of entities like plants, humans, and animals, and even 
of conditions of being like youth, sickness, and old age. By adopting various modal states, the 
painter sees with the eye of brahman. In this way, he recognizes at once the variegated nature 
of things in this world, as well as their essential unity as having the nature of the supreme self. 
For, in just the same way that the union of Śiva and Śakti produces the emanation of various 
things into their transmigratory existence, without changing their fundamental nature, the work 
of the painter (citra) each time recapitulates the logic of cosmic creation. Thus, the production 
of a painting is an act of incarnation (citrāvatāra) and the maker of a painting (citrakṛta) 
commits to a process that our text explicitly homologizes with kuṇḍalinī yoga. With his brush, 
he brings about the coming together in a single space of Śiva and Śakti whose nature is moon,

sun, and perhaps fire;663 the vital force, arising from the seat of the sun, first becomes attached 
to the central channel, here called the path of Brahmā, before finally dissolving in the middle 
of the moon in an act that produces the finished painting. It is for this reason that painting 
(cītrarūpa), which represents the totality of things in the world, all of which are none other 
than Śiva and Śakti, must be understood as “as the agent of life in the midst of life itself” 
(jīvamadhye jīvakaṃ). 
In much the same way, moreover, that paintings are said to both contain worlds within 
themselves and to revitalize the external world, the painter and his craft are said to be animated 
by the mantra. This mantra, called haṃsa, is said to continually repeat itself silently inside of 
all living beings in the form of the natural inhalation and exhalation of the breath. This practice 
becomes a mainstay of early modern yoga, particularly when combined with a particular kind 
of non-ritualized, absorptive yoga that facilitates the dissolution of mental states into an 
abiding consciousness beyond conceptual thought, which texts come to refer to as amanaska 
yoga. Indeed, the Aparājitapṛcchā repeatedly prescribes this deliberate enunciation of the 
haṃsa mantra by the artisan as forming the necessary precondition for the bringing into being 
of any new material object—as, for example, when it is defined it as the 
mūrtiprārambhamantra at the conclusion of the chapter on the worship of the Sarasvatī who 
is in actuality Bhairavī. Its essential relation to this goddess—who after all is depicted “riding” 
upon the haṃsa—is suggested by the somewhat gnomic passage with which the 
Svacchandabhairavāvatāra division of the Aparājitapṛcchā concludes: 
The haṃsa is said to be the seed in all mantras. The haṃsa is the god Sadāśiva; haṃsa alone is the lord Hari. Haṃsa is Brahmā, and Yama, and Sūrya, and Fire, and the universal deity. Haṃsa is water, air, space, dharma, Indra, the god of wealth, and the 
663Candrārkapavanātmakam would usually mean that which has the nature of moon, sun, and wind or vital breath, but the context suggests we want a different triad and pavana in any case is attested in the sense of a householder’s fire. 
699 
earth. . . . Thus the haṃsa has gone about as the self of all, higher than the highest. Parāśakti is dissolved in the haṃsa. Thus, they relate this meaning. The forty-nine letters go to destruction. At the end of destruction, however, they become known of as the varṇas and they are from Maheśvara. But Śakti goes to her ending when she is absorbed in the forehead. This is called the place of the void, which is worshipped always by the yogins. From the forehead to the heart, it comes—that which is the supreme amanaska state. The sūtradhāra, seated upon the āsana, should recite the mantra with the bīja.664 
The identity of this goddess, Sarasavatī as Bhairavī, will prove quite relevant for our 
further explorations of the Śākta material and textual cultures of the early medieval Deccan, 
and their earlier Tantric and Atimārgic antecedents. Thus, it is no accident that she will 
reappear on multiple occasions throughout the remainder of this chapter. The above passage 
also hints at an esoteric soteriology related to the directing of unbroken attention at the place 
of the void “worshipped always by the yogins,” a practice that is a central focus of the religious 
life of the late medieval Deccan—especially within the domain that now corresponds to 
Maharashtra and parts of Gujarat. While a careful analysis of such matters will form a major 
focus of the later portion of the eighth chapter, for our present purposes, what is perhaps most 
pertinent is what we are beginning to see here is the emergence within artisan circles—out 
from the realm of formally ritualized Tantric discourse—of something akin to the stripped- 
down subtle body yoga praxis we find among early modern ascetic traditions such as the Nātha 
yogins. If, reaching forward in time, the Aparājitapṛcchā’s nascent vision of amanaska yoga 
prefigures the sort of materials one finds in the work often rather appropriately entitled the 
664Aparājitapṛcchā 226.30–36, pg. 581: tasmāt sarveṣu mantreṣu haṃso bījaḥ sa ucyate // haṃsaḥ sadāśivo devo haṃsaś caiveśvaro hariḥ / brahmā haṃso yamaḥ sūryo ’gnir haṃsaḥ sarvadaivatam // āpo vāyuś ca khaṃ haṃso dharmend[r]au dhanadaḥ kṣitiḥ /. . . . evaṃ sa gato haṃsaḥ sarvātmā paraṃparā / haṃse līno parāśaktir ity arthaṃ vyāharanti ca // varṇā ekonapañcaśannidhanaṃ yānti tatra vai / nidhanānte tu vijñeyā varṇās te tu maheśvar[rāt] // nidhanaṃ tu gatā śaktir yadā mūrdhni pralīyate / śūnyasthānam idaṃ proktaṃ sevyate yogibhiḥ sadā // mūrdhnā hṛdayam āyāty amanaskaṃ paramaṃ padam / sthitvāsane sūtradhāro japen mantraṃ sabījakam // 
700 
Amanaska, especially in its second chapter,665 the same set of ideas also have a prehistory in 
Tantric thought that is intimately bound up with artisan communities. In fact, as we shall soon 
see, it is this earlier work that will eventually enable us to make sense of the seemingly 
disparate dimensions of the Aparājitapṛcchā itself and its strange marriage of the worship of 
Svacchanda and his Bhairavas with the veneration of Sarasvatī. To do so, we need to first 
explore our earliest evidence for a crucial but vexing term, Kāruka, intimately bound up with 
early artisan imaginaries, and what it might mean within the greater Śaiva cosmopolis of South 
and Southeast Asia as well as in more quotidian śāstric literature. Having done so, we can 
continue to trace the prehistory of the Kāruka traditions through the archive of what Alexis 
Sanderson and his students have reconstructed of the doxographical landscape of Tantric and 
Atimārgic communities. Because this subject has been of marginal interest even within the 
philological study of early Śaivism, our archive of past scholarship largely consists of technical 
asides in footnotes and running commentaries in critical editions. Even within the primary 
sources themselves, these exercises in doxography are usually terse and polemical in nature, 
structured in a matter often designed to sublimate our actual object of study to the more familiar 
classical Tantric doctrines that claimed to supersede them. 
Nevertheless, I would suggest, far from simply representing arcane lists of long 
forgotten communities whose texts and contexts are irrevocably lost, reading between the lines, 
it is these doxographies that provide us with the opportunity for locating key recurrent traces 
of artisan communities as centrally bound up with premodern Tantric socialities across time 
665 Further inquiry into this subject must await the publication of Jason Birch’s doctoral thesis on the Amanaska, which makes use of seventy-five manuscripts and recovers and historicizes a range of recensions of the text. From Birch’s publications thus far, we have been shown that the ascription of the work to either Gorakṣanātha or Matsyendranātha is a second order development not in evidence in the earliest manuscripts. That being said, it is perhaps not accidental that the Amanaska claims to have been revealed by a seer called Vāmadeva, for Vāmadeva and the artisan yogins are closely linked in tantric doxographies. 
701 
and space. These traces, in turn as we will see, are closely echoed in the Tantric-inflected vision 
of the Aparājitapṛcchā and what we will discover of the Piṅgalāmata and its attendant material 
cultures. Ultimately, we will discover that the artisan communities in the early medieval 
western Deccan, whose conditions of possibilities are these very occluded Tantric pasts, were 
themselves regularly bound up with initiatory Tantric Śākta lineages and their religious 
imaginaries. 
Unmaking the Makers: The Sublimation of the Kārukas as a Creative Force within 
Tantric Imaginaries 
As surprising is it might seem, except in regard to the rarefied world of the Nāṭyaśāstra, 
comparatively little careful textual scholarship or ethnographic work has been dedicated to 
making sense of the social realities within which either early medieval artist or more 
contemporary artisan figure would have operated. Even less attention has been given to 
recovering something of the sensibility that such a person—and not some elite rasa theorist— 
would have brought to their work. A rare recent exception to this general trend is a series of 
articles666 by Andre Acri dedicated to reconstructing the medieval South Asian roots of certain 
Javanese and Balinese medieval literary tropes and modern performance traditions. 
Acri masterfully argues that certain allegorical satires ostensibly depicting the behavior 
of different types of birds, found in the Old Javanese Kakavins, especially a ninth-century 
Rāmāyaṇa, present deliberate and highly particularized parodies of specific categories of 
666See Andrea Acri, “The Vaimala sect of the Pāśupatas: New Data from old Javanese Sources,” Tantric Studies 1 (2008): 193–208; Andrea Acri, “On Birds, Ascetics, and Kings in Central Java,” Rāmāyaṇa Kakawin 24 (2010): 95–125; Andrea Acri, “Birds, Bards, Buffoons, and Brahmans: (Re-)Tracing the Indic Roots of some Ancient and Modern Performing Characters from Java and Bali,” Archipel 88 (2014): 13–70; Andrea Acri, “The Śaiva Atimārga in the Light of the Niśvāsaguhya 12.1–22ab,” Cracow Indological Studies 16 (2014): 7–49. Within this research program, literary, art historical, and ethnographic studies in Monsoon Asia phenomena are bookended by two complementary text critical studies of unpublished doxographical passages from early Śaiva Tantric sources. 
702 
Atimārga Śaiva ascetics. In doing so, he draws our attention to an emic taxonomy of pre- 
Tantric “Śaiva” traditions that will prove integral to the main argument of this chapter. In these 
expanded doxographies, the Atimārga is said to consist not of the usual three divisions of 
Pāñcārthika Pāśupata, Lākula/Kālamukha, and Somasiddhānta/Kāpālika, but instead 
incorporates two additional categories, namely, that of the Vaimala and the Kāruka. While 
Acri’s main interest, motivated by his initial discovery of a range of references to “alepakas” 
in his source, is in making sense of the stainless (Vaimala) line of the Atimārga, we will focus 
on the even more neglected Kārukas as these will turn out to be intimately linked to our 
artisans. Perhaps most importantly for our purposes, Acri offers a compelling case that in the 
Javanese imagination, quite apart from their allegorical association with specific animals, 
particular categories of Atimārga ascetics tend to be consistently linked with specific 
professions, some of which correspond to performance traditions that at least until recently 
persisted on the ground.667 Extending this line of inquiry, Acri concludes this article by 
drawing our attention to the continuities between medieval narrative depictions of dances and 
comedic performances enacted by figures who the texts identify as Śaiva and living 
performance traditions that persist on the margins of courtly entertainment in Bali and Java. 
667This is the main argument (pg. 15) of “Birds, Bards, Buffoons, and Brahmans: (Re-)Tracing the Indic Roots of some Ancient and Modern Performing Characters from Java and Bali.” Acri first proposes that the figure identified as the peacock dancer mrak corresponds to the Kaumāras and other wild Śaiva “peacock” yogins, and, that the “wild pigeon” represents the bearded dancer type called pirus who corresponds to the Indic professional singer/performer class kuśīlava. Less plausibly, he also associates the pirus with the Atimārgic Kāruka. Acri next shows that the labelling of such a dancer to whom alms are offered as “lord of pigeons” (ḍarapati) conceals a pun, for the word ḍara also means a young girl or maiden. Using inscriptional, textual, and enthographic evidence, Acri shows the close association of these dancers with the tropical “Śaiva women” who in the texts are represented as performance artists, liminally related to royal courts, who chant the Śaiva brahmamantras and then with their male counterpart often mime suggestive and crude acts along with their dance and music performances. There then follows a study of the cathang balungs and the iconic figure of the siddhakārya, both bearded figures whose iconography and backstory speaks to Indic origins. 
703 
Thus for example, in the Javanese “bearded buffoon” called the canthang balungs—the name 
derives from a Javanese word meaning the “rattling of bones”—who assumes dance postures 
that resemble those of fierce Tantric deities, whose sigil is a liṅga and a yoni, whose office 
until the colonial encounter entailed management of the dancing girls, and whose ancestors 
European travel accounts represent as clandestinely consuming the five “m’s” of Śākta 
worship, Acri detects the persistence of a professionalized form of Kaula Kāpālika inflected 
performers, noncelibate ascetics seemingly slotted into a consistent albeit low status social 
role.668 Dialoguing with Ramachandra Chintamani Dhere and Phillip Lutgendorf, Acri 
suggestively extends his analysis, if but briefly, to attend to unexpected sociological 
continuities between Javanese and Balinese performance traditions and the typically low caste 
but ritually significant “folk” performance traditions in central and north India, including the 
dying art of the kuśīlavins of central Karnataka and the Maharashtrian tradition of gondhal.669 
He suggests that all of these disparate lineages seem to share common social and conceptual 
roots. Following a suggestion by Van Naerssen that the Sanskrit Old Javanese Lexicon, the 
Amaramālā, explains the Javanese term of art used in general for such performers, pirus, as a 
transcreation of the Sanskrit kuśīlava, Acri briefly traces these low-caste itinerant performers 
and singers back to into the Sanskrit Epic and Dharmaśāstra. 
In the context of this analysis, Acri notes in passing that, as early as the Manusmṛti 
(8.65, 8.102) and the Nāṭyaśāstra, the low-caste bards called kuśīlava habitually appear paired 
in compound with another term of art, the kāruka. As we have already seen, albeit briefly, in 
668Acri, “Birds, Bards, Buffoons, and Brahmans,” 30–42. 669Acri, “Birds, Bards, Buffoons, and Brahmans,” 29–30. For more on Gondhal and its relation to early medieval Tantric imaginaries, see the middle section of the next chapter. 
704 
the Śaiva sources, the Kāruka is alluded to as a separate category of Atimārga Śaivas. On the 
basis of the kārukas’ inclusion in passages in the Nāṭyaśāstra which outline the roles included 
among a troop of actors, Acri ingeniously proposes that the kāruka “in the Sanskrit legal texts 
and in the Nāṭyaśāstra are not to be interpreted as ‘artisans’ or ‘mechanics’ (√kṛ 1) but as 
‘singers’ or ‘bards’ (from kāru one who sings or praises, a poet,” √kṛ 2).”670 The evidence of 
the Kauṭilya Arthaśāstra,671 from which the Manusmṛti seems to directly derive its definition 
of the works allotted to a Śūdra as including kārukuśīlavakarma, however, renders such an 
explanation highly improbable. For here, in numerous passages, the pairing of kāruka and 
kuśīlava is complicated by the introduction of at least one more additional element, the śilpin, 
and indeed the designing of buildings (vāstu) is said to be conducted by a community 
comprised of kāruka and śilpin (as for example in KA 6.02 vāstukaṃ kāruśilpigaṇaḥ).672 
Kauṭilya’s writings offer us evidence that this social formation is at least as old as most 
of Sanskrit literature, of the wide range of activities with which the kāruka was associated, as 
well as of his indispensability in ensuring that a rich of variety of professional domains would 
continue to operate smoothly. The work of the kāru (kārukarma), for example, is mentioned 
in the Arthaśāstra’s discussions of the operations of the goldsmith, where it is said to involve, 
in Olivelle’s translation, the “manufacture of solid and hollow objects, plating [avalepya], 
overlaying, fastening, and gilding.”673 The kāruka then appears in discussions of the 
670Acri, “More on Birds,” 77–78; Acri, “Birds, Bards, Buffoons,” 21–22. 671All citations and translations of Kauṭilya are from Patrick Olivelle, King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India: Kauṭilya's Arthaśāstra (New York: Oxford University Press, 2016). 672In a manner that remains to be clarified, sometime around the Gupta-Vākāṭaka age, a semantic blurring of lines begins to emerge wherein the terms kāruka and śilpin begin to either be treated as virtual synonyms or else kāruka because the umbrella category referring to all the artisan castes. 673Olivelle, King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India, 133. Arthaśāstra 2.14.17: ghanaṃ suṣiraṃ samyūhyam avalepyaṃ saṃghātyaṃ vāsitakaṃ ca kārukarma // Arthaśāstra 2.18.01: āyudhāgārādhyakṣaḥ sāṃgrāmikaṃ daurgakarmikaṃ parapurābhighātikaṃ ca / yantram āyudham āvaraṇam upakaraṇaṃ ca tajjātakāruśilpibhiḥ / kṛtakarmapramāṇakālavetanaphalaniṣpattibhiḥ kārayet, svabhūmiṣu ca sthāpayet //

management of the armory, where the director in charge is supposed to recruit and employ, 
making sure to pay them fair wages, both kārus and śilpins “to manufacture mechanical devices 
for use in battle.”674 The master of yarn, we learn, is to make a similar arrangement in regard 
to employing independent kārukas so that they supply the materials for making cloth as well 
as armor, and the superintendent of agriculture is said to be dependent on kārukas, smiths 
(karmāra), carpenters (kuṭṭāka), hunters (medaka), and rope makers (rajju) in ensuring that a 
plow and other needed tools are supplied to his workers.675 Unlike with regular labor, the 
rations and wages of artisans, for they are compensated in both gold and food, are paid in 
proportion to their work output. Within even the rather centralized state oriented social order 
envisioned by Kauṭilya, those who engage in kārukarma are granted an unusual degree of 
independence. Kārukas and śilpins, for example, provide lodgings within their own homes and 
workshops for visiting artisans from abroad and police fraud within the community. 
In his efforts to provide a South Asian context to his discoveries, in the service of 
making sense of his Vimalas, Acri has translated and edited several important unpublished 
passages drawn from the corpus associated with the circa fifth- to seventh-century scripture, 
the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā, our earliest surviving work of Margamārga Śaivism, which seems 
to be incorporating doxographical materials drawn from even older Atimārga textual traditions 
that are now lost to us.676 Perhaps the most important of these sources is from the twelfth paṭala 
of the likely seventh-century Niśvāsaguhya. This text offers brief doctrinal sketches of five 
different Atimārga traditions, presented here in the ascending sequence of Pāñcārthika, 
Pramāṇa, Vaimala, and finally the Tantric Śaivas. As Acri demonstrates, in regard to its 
674Olivelle, King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India, 142. 675Olivelle, King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India, 151–152. 676See Acri, “The Vaimala sect of the Pāśupatas” and “The Śaiva Atimārga in the Light of the Niśvāsaguhya.”

treatment of the Pāñcārthika Pāśupatas, the Guhya’s distillation incorporates numerous textual 
parallels to our surviving sources. It is thus likely that the same verisimilitude and precision 
would have applied to its treatment of the other early streams of Śaiva revelation.

For those readers who are unfamiliar with the ever-evolving discourses of Sanderson 
and his students seeking to map the origins of early Tantric communities, the term 
“Atimārga”—the path beyond—is an emic formulation of self-description as well as a later 
term used by doxographers to categorize Tantric revelation. While it increasingly seems clear 
that within the lived realities of communities of the real world, these categories were far more 
fluid, the strictly textual realm typically envisions these traditions as discrete and even 
oppositional schools that share a common genealogy. We have already encountered the 
Pāñcārthika Pāśupatas in chapter 1, where we examined their only extant commentarial work, 
Kauṇḍinya’s commentary on the Pāśupatasūtras. We are fortunate to have several additional 
textual sources available for the study of Pāśupatas. When it comes to the rest of these 
traditions, however, our evidentiary basis for their study is fraught with difficulty. Not a single 
707intact work in its original form has been transmitted down in the present, though as we will 
see, there is abundant evidence that what we call Tantric revelation has heavily “cannibalized” 
these older canons in a manner that makes possible some degree of reconstruction. 
In this spirit, the item that is most relevant to our current concerns is the “Pramāṇa” 
tradition, from which, as you will see, we have surviving only a single verified passage. The 
manner, in fact, in which the Niśvāsaguhya treats the Pramāṇa system of the Lākulas—as skull 
bearing meditators, covered in ash, who revere Rudra, dwell outside of the big cities and 
receive alms from all four castes—seems to correspond quite closely with what we have found 
in our study of the Kālamukhas. As you can see from the chart which I have extrapolated from 
his writings above, Acri has mapped the Pramāṇa scriptures onto the category of the Lākulas, 
from whom, as we know, our familiar Kālamukhas descend. Pivotally for our argument, he 
also understands the Pramāṇa/Lākulas as the progenitors of the Kārukas. But whereas he 
understands the Kārukas as an internal development within Lākula discourse, what we will 
discover is an abundance of evidence that suggests that this tradition had an independent point 
of origin and conceptual focus before it was ultimately subsumed under the auspices of first 
the Lākula tradition itself and then of its Tantric antecedents within the Bhairava Siddhānta 
To understand these developments, we need to begin by thinking more broadly about 
the workmanly dimensions of Tantric doxographies—namely, that they are not merely “maps 
of” preexisting religious terrains but “maps for” reorganizing lived religious landscapes into 
doctrinal and social hierarchies. Thus, as reflected in the Niśvāsa corpus, the main conceit of 
Tantric Śaiva representations of their archaic Atimārga antecedents is to at once incorporate 
their contents into their own traditions while signaling that they supersede these prior modes 
of praxis and knowledge. The Niśvāsaguhya accomplishes this through a series of taxonomic 
708 
schemata that embed polemics. Treating each of the Atimārga traditions as corresponding to 
one of the quasi-Vedic pañcabrahma mantras, it assigns to the Siddhānta the culminating 
veneration of sadyojāta. As we shall see, for all of these traditions, though less so for the 
Tantric Śaivas, the pañcabrahma mantras form an integral part of the mantrin’s tool kit. The 
second structuring principle deployed in the Niśvāsaguhya is that in sequence, each of the five 
traditions is said to correspond to the privileging of a specific mode of praxis. For the 
Pāśūpatas, whose classical texts do not envision initiation, this is caryā; for the Pramāṇa and 
Kāruka, who are associated in particular with yoga, this is jñāna; the Vaimalas are connected 
to a special dīkṣā; and finally, of course, the Tantric Śaivas possess the whole array of 
modalities. As Alexis Sanderson and Acri have dealt rather exhaustively with the matter, for 
the moment we need only note here in passing that similar supersessionary rhetorical work is 
happening at the level of cosmology; in Tantric Śaiva enumerations of the tattvas and 
bhuvanas, the Pramāṇa traditions is assigned to a lower ontic plane in the cosmic hierarchy, 
where they devote their worship to a slightly humbler emanation of the Supreme deity, usually 
called Dhruva, while the Vaimalas in turn are associated with the slightly more elevated entity 
called Tejīśa.677 
What is important for us to remember is that these byzantine cosmologies, like the 
sedimentary layers of the geological record, capture in sequence the emergence of discrete 
layers in Śaiva religiosity within historical time.678 Moreover, in a spirit similar to what literary 
theorists have labelled “the anxiety of influence,” through deliberate attempts to emend and 
677As Acri and Sanderson both discuss at length, from text to text these exact sequences and hierarchies are contested, reimagined, and sometimes simply not well understood by redactors. 678This phenomenon corresponds to what Alexis Sanderson has labelled “super-enthronement,” originally in the context of discussing iconography. Alexis Sanderson, “Mandala and Āgamic Identity in the Trika of Kashmir,” in Mantras et Diagrammes Rituelles dans l’ Hindouisme, ed. André Padoux (Paris: Éditions du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 1986), 169–214.

manipulate the representation of the relationship between these communities, specific Śaiva 
and Śākta-Śaiva communities are engaging in a form of critical reflection about their 
relationship with their own past. It is thus of critical importance, then, that as Acri has observed, 
even when they are listed in doxographical catalogs of the Atimārga, the Kārukas are not 
usually treated as a separate subject worthy of exploration but instead are simply lumped in 
with the Pramāṇa tradition. In essence, through an archaeology of the earlier relationship 
between the Pramāṇa tradition, from which our Kālamukhas descend, and Kārukas, we will be 
in a position to arrive at important insights about the sociology of artisan communities in the 
medieval Deccan. 
As we have begun to see, within the various different sections of the Niśvāsa, the 
interrelationship between the five branches of Atimārga Śaivas are represented through the 
medium of a variety of conceptual models. One particularly striking strategy, evident for 
example in the Guhya, offers a Śaiva version of the “Puruṣasūkta” that homologizes them to 
the five faces of Śiva and these five faces in turn to parts of the human body. For our purposes, 
the following detail is of pivotal importance. Within such a framework, while the Pramāṇa 
Śāstra of the Lākulas is consistently correlated with the center in the heart—corresponding to 
Aghora—the Kārukas are placed directly beneath them—subject to Vāmadeva— at the level 
of the genitals. A later work in the Niśvāsa discourse provides us with additional conceptual 
clarification. In the Niśvāsakārikā, the youngest portion of the Niśvāsa corpus, we are told that, 
unlike the loftier Vimalas who possess jñāna and the Pramāṇa adepts who teach jñāna, the 
Kārukas are ones whose travels in the planar realm have been purified by initiation alone 
(dīkṣādhvānaviśodhitam).679 In other words, the Kārukas do not have full knowledge of the 
679Hans Bakker, “Somaśarman, Somavaṃśa and Somasiddhānta: A Pāśupata Tradition in Seventh-Century Dakṣiṇa Kosala,” in Haranandalahari. Volume in Honour of Professor Minoru Hara on his Seventieth Birthday, 
710 
systems into which they are initiated nor the right to teach them. The texts in question, into 
which the Kārukas would have received initiation but who were not granted their stewardship, 
were the eight-fold pramāṇas of the Lākula tradition. It is hardly an accident, then that as we 
shall soon see the sole surviving passage from the Pramāṇaśāstras is dedicated to an 
exploration of the aghora mantra, which embodies the face of the god, residing in the heart, to 
which the Lākulas were doxographically assigned. 
(Diagram as given by Andre Acri) (Supplementary chart) 
Now curiously, we find a rather telling transposition of this same dependent 
hierarchical relationship—where the Lākulas assigned to Aghora reside at the level of the heart 
and have stewardship over their subordinates, aligned with Vāmadeva, at the level of the 
genitals—within the later classically dualistic work of the Śaiva Siddhānta such as the 
Mṛgendra Tantra. There, however, in place of the eight-fold Pramāṇas of the Lākula, at the 
level of the heart aligned with Aghora, we instead find the eight Bhairava Tantras, again 
associated with Aghora, but also placed in the stream of Dakṣiṇa. At the level of the genitals, 
the slot where the Kārukas were placed, we now find the Vāma Tantras in the stream of Vāma.

For the benefit of the reader who has not spent a good portion of their life struggling to 
grasp the convoluted ways long dead Tantric practitioners talked about themselves and drew 
up their family trees, in the most basic terms, these canons can be organized in sets organized 
around five, as we saw above, but also in terms of a model where there are three major streams. 
In the oldest sources, such as the Picumata Brahmayāmala—which assigns itself to the 
Vāma—these three streams are called Dakṣina, Madhya, and Vāma. Part of why these models 
become so convoluted in that, in a typically Indian fashion, rather than abandoning one model 
in favor of another as canons expand over time and complexify, our authors are hell bent on 
merging all these strategies into a single framework. While to them this might have been an 
adequate way to salvage the hypothesis of perfected revelation, from our perspective centuries 
later the result is needlessly redundancies and incoherence.

Returning to the focus at hand, that the doxographical model evident in the Mṛgendra— 
where the eight Bhairava Tantras are correlated with the level of the heart and the Vāma is 
aligned with the genitals—gained wide acceptance is evident from the presence of a similar 
712 
position, complete with the same implicit subordination, in the Tantrāloka itself. Here, 
Abhinavagupta seems also to suggest that, while they fall within the context of the circle of 
the mothers in the doctrine of Bhairava (mātṛmaṇḍale bhairave), the Siddhāntas of Vaimala, 
the Ārhatas, and the Kārukas and so forth should be treated like mere paśus. In other words, 
Abhinavagupta seemingly affirms their subordinate inclusion as well as the judgment we find 
in the Niśvāsakārikā that, to cite Acri, “unlike the more ‘gnostic’ Vaimalas and 
Mahāvratas/Lākulas, [the Kārukas] adhered to the chiefly practice oriented among the 
Pramāṇaśāstras.”680 In other words, through practicing the vow of the skull with full knowledge 
of what that entails, the Lākulas are remembered by the later Siddhānta as ascending to a higher 
level in the context of the cosmic hierarchies of worlds, in contrast to the Kārukas, “who merely 
held their observances until their deaths.” For this reason, as Acri demonstrates, in many of 
these cosmologies, while the Lākulas are placed in the pure realm outside of the material world, 
in the ancient cosmologies, the Kārukas—also equated with the ṛṣikula—are placed at the very 
cusp between the world of light and the world of darkness, still within the world of māyā. 
In this regard, it is likely that Abhinavagupta is following the teachings of Trika Tantras 
such as the Siddhayogeśvarīmata, which as we shall soon see preserve evidence of a much 
closer relationship with the Lākula and Kārukas traditions than has been recognized. In its first 
chapter, after praising the guru who can give śaktipāta—causing the entrance of goddesses 
into the body of the disciple—the Siddhayogeśvarīmata also concludes by telling us that 
“here,” in this system, a practitioner is not considered initiated (dīkṣita) into Trika praxis if he 
simply practices the samaya of the Kārukas, Pramāṇas and so forth.681 This is in some ways a 
680Acri, “The Śaiva Atimārga in the Light of Niśvāsaguhya,” 39. 681 Here I am reading “kāruka” for kārakapramāṇādisamayena, given the common confusion in Nepalese scripts of “a” and “u.” This particular error is ubiquitous. Siddhayogeśvarīmata 1.17–19: tasmāt siddhiṃ samanvicchec chivasaṃskāradīkṣitaḥ / rudraśaktisamāveśam jñātvā tadgraham ācaret // na kārakapramāṇādisamayenātra 
713 
particularly ironic statement, for as Judit Törzsök has effectively demonstrated, without 
however arriving at explicit understanding of the implications of her discovery, the first two 
chapters of the Siddhayogeśvarīmata contain extensive textual parallels with the only surviving 
passage that survives from the original eight-fold Lākula Pramāṇaśāstras. 
dīkṣitaḥ / na cājyānalasadbhāvavarjitas tu kathaṃcana // kāmye karmaṇi śasyante mānasā muktikāṅkṣiṇaḥ / śaive kecid ihecchanti bhairave na kadācana // Judit Törzsök, ed. and trans., The Doctrine of Magic Female Spirits: A Critical Edition of Selected Chapters of the Siddhayogeśvarīmata (Tantra) with Annotated Translation and Analysis (PhD diss., University of Oxford, 1999). Here the Siddhayogeśvarīmata seems to make two points. The first is that Kārukas and Lākulas need additional initiations where they attain possession by the goddess to practice its system. The second is that, unlike in “Śaiva” systems, where ones who desire liberation can perform mental worship without using material substances and making fire oblations, this is never allowed in “Bhairava” systems. Apart from offering an inversion of Abhinavagupta’s core theological orientation towards blurring the lines between material and conceptual worship, this seems to suggest that when the Siddhayogeśvarīmata was written, Atimārga practitioners were distinguished from Śaivas and Bhairavasiddhāntins but allowed to take initiation. It is interesting that while the objection to the Śaiva is doctrinal in nature and represents an irresolvable difference, the conflict with the Kārukas and Lākulas is purely procedural and eminently fixable—regardless of their position within their own hierarchies, they simply are required to submit to a full initiation into the Trika system. 
714 
(Diagram as given by Alexis Sanderson in the Lākulas)682 
As we will see momentarily, that the foundational work of the Trika should single out 
for special attention the traditions of the Atimārga is not so unexpected in light of their 
surprising degrees of hitherto unnoticed affinity. In his groundbreaking article on the Lākula 
tradition, Alexis Sanderson has recovered the names ascribed to an archaic canon of works 
682Alexis Sanderson, “The Lākulas: New Evidence of a System Intermediate between Pāñcārthika Pāśupatism and Āgamic Śaivism,” The Indian Philosophical Annual 24 (2006): 174–175. 
715 
called Pramāṇa Śāstras,683 each of which derives its title from the cosmic agent that revealed 
it. As he shows us, following Kṣemarāja, the Pramāṇaśāstras were variously said to be 
eightfold or fourteenfold. The eightfold canon is said to be concerned with jñāna, while the 
additional members are associated with kriyā. When the scriptural canon is understood as 
containing fourteen textual fields, the additional six Pramāṇas are said to be contained within 
or subordinated (Kṣemarāja says tasyāntarbhūtāni) to the fourth of the eight Pramāṇaśāstras, 
called the Hṛdayapramāṇa. In other words, this scale of texts replicates the logic of inclusive 
subordination we keep encountering, wherein the Lākula, associated with gnosis, governs the 
Kārukas, associated with “doing things.” Before we turn to rethinking the Kārukas, it is worth 
grappling with the single fragmentary passage of Lākula Pramāṇaśāstra, about which Alexis 
Sanderson writes: 
To my knowledge all that remains of this canon of texts is a passage of seven verses attributed to the Pañcārthapramāṇa in Kṣemaràja’s commentary on the Svacchanda (ad 1.41-43). Short though it is, it does serve to confirm that the Pramāṇa system is the basis of the system described by the Niśvāsamukha. It is an analysis of the Aghoramantra, one of the five Brahmamantras which are the mantras of the Pāśupatas. The form of that mantra is the offering of obeisance (namaskāraḥ), or, as the Pāśpatas understand that action, the donation of oneself (ātmasamarpaṇam, parityāgaḥ), to the three classes of Rudras, or ectypes of Rudra: the Benevolent (aghoraḥ), the Terrible (ghoraḥ), and the Utterly Terrible (ghoraghorataraḥ): aghorebhyo ’tha ghorebhyo ghoraghoratarebhyaś ca sarvataḥ śarva sarvebhyaḥ namas te rudra rūpebhyaḥ. The Pañcārthapramāṇa correlates these three groups with the Rudras who govern the levels of its Hierarchy of Worlds. The Aghora Rudras of the Mantra are equated with a series of Rudras beginning with Vāmeśvara which reside above the Net of Bonds. The Ghora Rudras are said to be “those that begin with Gopati and end with Gahana”, while the Ghoraghorataras are identified as the “Mahāmāheśvaras from Vidyeśvara to Ananta” who occupy worlds below them.684 
683Drawing on both the Niśvāsaguhya and the Nepalese recension of the Svacchanda Tantra, Sanderson arrives at the following list of scriptures 1) Pañcārthapramāṇa, 2) Śivaguhya, 3) Rudrāṅkuśa, 4) Hṛdaya, 5) Vyūha, 6) Lakṣaṇa, 7) Ākarṣa, 8) Ādarśa. Sanderson, “The Lākulas,” 171. 684Sanderson, “The Lākulas,” 175. 
716 
While Sanderson’s summary is unsurprisingly entirely accurate, an examination of the 
passage he has identified from Pañcārthapramāṇa, especially when read in light of 
Kṣemarāja’s surrounding commentary, reveals that his analysis overlooks some key 
dimensions to this discourse that will prove exceptionally relevant to our own inquiry. 
Therefore, especially since this is all we have from a core Lākula scripture that comes attached 
to its title, the matter is worth revisiting. Kṣemarāja introduces his readers to the

717issue at the point where the Svacchanda Tantra has begun to introduce us to its mantra 
system.686 The mantras in question are the praṇava or haṃsa mantra, which in the Svacchanda 
Tantra is the bīja hūṃ, along with the aghora mantra itself (aghorebhyo ’tha ghorebhyo 
ghoraghoratarebhyaś ca sarvataḥ śarva sarvebhyaḥ namas te rudra rūpebhyaḥ). The longer 
mantra is treated as the “sakala”—or extended—form of hūṃ and identified with the god 
Svacchanda Bhairava himself. From a historical perspective, the Svacchanda Tantra is 
claiming that is own mantra system is simple a convenient extension of an older Lākula 
Atimārga methodology that made use of the aghora heart mantra. In other words, the 
Svacchanda is telling us that it imagines itself, and the other eight Bhairava Tantras, as a 
distillation or successor to the eight Pramāṇa sources. 
This same basic interpretive framework, where something old and pre-Tantric is 
presented and then analogized with something within a Trika inflected approach to the 
Bhairava Tantras, is a recurrent strategy throughout Kṣemarāja’s exegesis. For our purposes,

718 
recognizing this is important because it makes it possible for us to recover some features from 
the older Atimārgic systems relevant to our analysis. Now the Svacchanda Tantra appears to 
teach an abbreviated cosmology where the hierarchy of worlds are seemingly mapped onto the 
human body. The way this subdivision works is that the world of the light begins at the level 
of the head or throat and world of the dark corresponds to everything below it. In the usual 
Tantric fashion, our text teaches that the mantra hūṃ, which condenses the aghora mantra, is 
to be made to pervade the whole body—and by extension the whole world—through the five- 
stage intoning of the mantra (mantroccāraṇa). The intoning of the mantra ultimately serves 
the salvific purpose of “piercing the bindu.” This is located at the boundary between the pure 
and impure worlds. If we follow Kṣemarāja, this level, governed by the demiurge Ananta, is 
located within a “knot” (granthi)—either at the level of the upper palate within a person’s head 
or at the throat. In these sources, the bindu itself is seen to have “the form of the illumination 
of consciousness” and is “shaped like a kadamba ball.” In keeping with his exegetical project 
of reading his teacher Abhinavagupta’s philosophy univocally into the older Tantric corpus, 
Kṣemarāja quotes the lost Trikahṛdaya in a manner that equates the bindu, located at the level 
of Ananta, within the upward rising (stream) of Bhairava, with the form of the Trika goddess 
Parāparā. When the two passages are read as expressing the same message, they suggest that 
when the dissolution or piercing of the bindu is complete, the state of being a finite soul will 
dissolve. With this in mind, as Kṣemarāja says, “for the purpose of protecting the essence of 
the words of the mantra,” the Svacchanda Tantra introduces the aghora mantra in a cryptic 
and encoded fashion so that “the way it conjoins together is not shown.” After quickly 
uncoding the proper sequence of its components, so that the mantra is treated as having three 
key core components—corresponding to aghora, ghora, and ghoratara—Kṣemarāja proceeds 
719 
to teach what he calls “the secret meaning,” which he does through offering a series of esoteric 
etymologies as well as ascribing hidden doctrinal significance to individual terms within the 
mantra. Now, as Peter Bisschop has shown with regard to Kauṇḍinya and Sanderson in relation 
to Abhinavagupta, Tantric scholastics during the classical period engaged in this type of textual 
practice are very likely to begin their analysis by taking recourse to the oldest portions of their 
varied and mostly lost canons. First, they faithfully transmit the doctrinally archaic positions 
of their sources and only once that is done do they reformulate the inherited tradition to match 
their own theology and idiom. I want to suggest that it is highly probable that here Kṣemarāja 
is doing something similar, and his initial sources are drawn from other Lākula materials. That 
this might be the case is suggested by the fact that idiom of this secret teaching diverges sharply 
from our commentator’s own metalanguage but resonates strongly, as we shall soon see, with 
the only surviving identified passage of Pramāṇaśāstra as well as the characterizations of 
Lākula discourse presented by Sanderson and his disciples.687 
687Our evidence runs as follows. Kṣemarāja begins by presenting an inherited gloss of “aghora” as “O Supreme lord Rudra (he parameśvara rudra)” who is said to be the cause of the dispersion of all bonds (aśeṣapāśadrāvaṇasya ca heto) that obstruct the mind (manorodhanasya). If this invocation, of Rudra and not Parabhairava or Śiva as the supreme deity, especially in the context of analyzing a Tantra dedicated to Svacchanda Bhairava, points us to an archaic layer of discourse that is then married to a typically Anuttara Trika investment in reading such matters gnosologically as a means of entering into the splendor of supreme consciousness (paracaitanyasphurānupraveśāt), a position probably stemming from a separate Kaula inheritance. In his gloss of “ghora,” which Kṣemarāja treats as the middle term, the merely terrible is equated with difference and non- difference (bhedābheda) corresponding to the entities that move about in the middle planar realms “playing” in the states of Īśa and Sadāśiva. In other words, just like the Pañcārthapramāṇa, Kṣemarāja is equating the three key components of the mantra with a threefold division of the planar realms. Finally, and perhaps most eccentrically, Kṣemarāja equates the category of the most terrible (ghoraghora) not, as we would expect, with the appearance of that term in the mantra, but instead with the word śarva. In a completely syntactically impossible fashion, in his source this lexeme is pseudo-etymologically treated as a contraction meaning “the one with a form that is the concealer of refuge (śaraṇavaraṇarūpa—interpreted as (śa)śaraṇa-(r)rūpa-(va)varaṇa). Such a terrible force, Kṣemarāja tells us, “produces the state of affairs of merely consisting of creation, maintenance, dissolution, and destruction.” Again, this is a rather odd formulation in that, in place of the usual five-fold canons of acts of Śiva, ending in anugraha or grace, it instead differentiates pralaya and saṃhāra, usually synonymous terms for acts of destruction or dissolution, into two discrete phases. 
720 
Apart from antiquarian interest, establishing that Kṣemarāja’s sources here are 
archaic—belonging to neither the Svacchanda’s own system nor to his own preferred canon of 
the Trika and the Krama, is important because it suggests that the same holds true for the next 
portion of his analysis, which deals with the “connection” between the three division of the 
aghora mantra. Kṣemarāja writes: “for the sake of the connection (sambandhibhyaḥ)—this 
means, to the ones whose nature is the wheel of śaktis (tacchakticakra) belonging to the various 
Rudras, whose forms are the proliferating instantiations of the three-fold śaktis called Raudrī, 
Jyeṣṭhā, and Vāma. In another arrangement/system (saṃhitāntare), they are etymologized by 
the names Parā, Parāparā, and Aparā.” Just as we have seen with the glossing of particular 
lexemes, Kṣemarāja here is pasting together two layers of discourse, Lākula and Trika. Both 
of these view the triad of categories of male deities encoded in the aghora mantra as paired 
complementarily with a triad of female entities. But, whereas in Kṣemarāja’s own system, it is 
the goddesses who are the dominant forces, in the first half of his gloss, these śaktis (Raudrī, 
Jyeṣṭhā, Vāma) are subordinated to the rudras. And this is precisely what we find in the only 
surviving passage of the Lākula scriptures found in the Pañcārthapramāṇa: 
The one called ghora is known of as the net of bondage (pāśajāla). It is conjoined with sin (pāpa) and it is terrifying. But the ones of whom that [the net of bondage] does not exist are known as aghora. The rudras who are Vāmeśvara and so forth are situated above the root of the net; those ones are called aghoras. Listen, concisely, concerning the ghora. The ghoras are rudras from Gopati to Gahana, and they live in various worlds. Now the ones residing below who are beginning with Vidyeśvara and end with Ananta are distinct; they are Mahāmaheśvaras, the more terrible than the terrible. Among these ones—aghoras, ghoras, and ghoraghoras—the śaktis that belong to Parameśvara are always differentially established. These śaktis are present as being the impellers of all purposes, in these various forms, in the states of stasis, dissolution, and creation and the activities of bondage and liberation. The bound soul (aṇu) does homage to all these forms. Homage and surrender are defined as the cause and the effect.688

721 
In her article on Aghoreśvarī, Judit Törzsök has already indicated that there exist a 
number of textual interconnections—including a shared triadic cosmology to which we will 
return momentarily—between this passage, which she has translated with some minor 
differences, and the oldest work of the Trika, the Siddhayogeśvarīmata.689 That work is of 
course dedicated to the worship of the triad of goddesses Parā, Parāparā, and Aparā, venerated 
by the Trika exegetes who Kṣemarāja has just admitted represent another system’s take on the 
older triad of Raudrī, Jyeṣṭhā, and Vāmā. What Törzsök has not discussed explicitly is that 
these formal connections—such as a shared triadic cosmology—appear also to extend 
meaningfully into the realm of doctrine. When the Pañcārthapramāṇa and Kṣemarāja’s 
additional unnamed Lākula sources are read in relation to the earliest Trika scripture, it 
becomes plain that, at least in a nascent form, a key doctrine of the Trika itself, namely, that 
volitional activity of all kinds in all domains is the result of the play of the śaktis with their 
rudras operating within objects and sentient beings—indeed, that the character of phenomena 
themselves are a product of a similar process—is inherited from the Lākulas along with their 
cosmology.

The Siddhayogeśvarīmata lacks the strong allusion to the wording of the Aghoramantra, which the Lākula passage has at the end, and does not mention the names of Rudras, unlike the Lākula text.” Judit Törzsök, “The (Un)dreadful Goddess: Aghorī in Early Śākta Tantras,” in Goddess Traditions in Tantric Hinduism, ed. Bjarne Wernicke Olesen (New York: Routledge, 2015), 36. In regard to this first point, however, the Siddhayogeśvarīmata as a whole is much more in alignment with the Lākulas than one might expect. In fact, the text begins with a damaged invocation of Bhairava as comprised of the aghora mantra. Siddhayogeśvarīmata 1.1–4: aghoraghorarūpāṇi ghoraghoratarāṇi ca / sthitāni yasya sūtraṃ tu tantrātmaṃ eva ca // praṇamya śirasā bhīmaṃ bhairavaṃ bhairavīpriyam / bhairavīsiddhidātāraṃ ajaṃ viśvaṃ svayambhuvam // mahāvinodanirataṃ devadevaṃ jagadgurum / svasthānasthaṃ mahāghoraṃ aghoraṃ ghoranāśanam // bhairavaṃ bhairavī devī praṇipatya samāhitam / 
722 
Succinctly, when we look at the other passages from the Niśvāsa discussed by 
Sanderson, where the Lākulas are discussed, it also seems likely that the Trika’s trademark 
linguistic theology—its equation of the goddess with language and the understanding that it is 
through the manipulation of the alphabet that a person transcends the world of bondage and 
transmigration governed by the terrible and extremely terrible force—is also at least in part a 
Lākula inheritance. In the Lākula cosmology, entities called ghoras, and ghorataras with their 
consort śaktis are said to dwell in the various subdivisions in the lower universe—this is called 
the net (jālam) within the realm of the impure. 
In these same sources, especially those preserved in the Niśvāsa corpus, the deities 
affiliated with the Kārukas, here associated with the category of ṛṣikula, are placed right at the 
juncture between the pure and impure realm. In contrast, the aghoras, namely, “the rudras who 
are Vāmeśvara and so forth,” “are situated above the root of the net,” which is to say within 
the pure realm. Rather pointedly, in this system, the boundary between the impure realm of 
māyā and pure realms is marked, not as it is in classical Śaiva Siddhānta by a male demiurge, 
such as Ananta, but by a goddess called Vāgeśvarī—the goddess of language.

724 
Now, as the seventh-century Niśvāsaguhya suggests, in discussing this early system, 
the Aghora or Lākula adept passes into this realm by being reborn from within the Goddess of 
Language’s womb in the form of the praṇava mantra—though this is likely oṃ instead of the 
hūṃ of the Bhairavasiddhānta. While later portions of the Niśvāsa corpus, such as the Guhya, 
associate such a position with the Atimārgic other, in the fifth-century Mūlasūtra of the 
Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā—our oldest work ascribed to Śaiva Siddhānta—the situation is very 
different.690 Especially in its fourth chapter, which covers the ritual that grants liberation, the 
goddess Vāgeśvarī is repeatedly elevated and paired mysteriously with a god called 
Vyomavyāpin or Caṇḍeśvara. When the adept undergoes the rites of studentship, symbolically 
reborn through a sequence of Śaiva saṃskāras, he proclaims that Vāgeśī is his mother. As he 
passes into adulthood, just as a Śrauta ritualist must take a wife, the initiated Śaiva is 
symbolically married to Jñānasiddhikumārikā, an extension of the goddess of speech. In 
concert with the ritual severing of his topknot, this coming-of-age process, identified as his 
“vidyādīkṣā,” gives the Tantric adept the ability to ascend through the hierarchies of planar 
world. Once again, nearly all these sequences of realities match Lākula cosmologies more 
closely than they do those of the later Siddhānta. In the Saiddhāntika system preserved in the 
Niśvāsa, access to ascent within the impure and mixed realms is accomplished through the 
invocation and ritual deployment of the three śaktis: Raudrī, Jyeṣṭhā, and Vāma. In contrast, 
exiting into the pure realm—which is said to be achieved by breaking “the great knot” of the 
impure realms—once again requires yet another experience of rebirth where the Śaiva initiate

725 
is placed into and passes through the “womb of Vāgīśvarī.” Emitted—one might even say 
ejaculated— in the form of the praṇava bīja, the Niśvāsa explicitly says, the initiate comes to 
rest in the realm assigned to the eight Pramāṇas of the Lākulas. 
In the introduction to her critical edition and translation of select section of the 
Siddhayogeśvarīmata, Törzsök has proposed that, in spite of its characterization as in essence 
triadic, the tradition we call the Trika originates as “the fusion of two opposite streams: one 
that attempts to subjugate and control impure forces related to the cult of the Eight Mothers, 
and another that mainly conforms to orthodox Hindu norms of purity adopting in its cult the 
orthodox goddess, Sarasvatī.”691 In support of this position, she directs our attention to the 
Kāpālika inflected character of the goddesses Parāparā and Aparā as well as the lack of a clear 
differentiation at the level of iconography as well as ritual function between the two entities, 
in contradistinction to the “sattvic” Parā—a sort of supped up Sarasvatī—who is so radically 
differentiated it is almost as if she belongs to a different reality. 
Nevertheless, it remains somewhat problematic to attribute the presence of a Sarasvatī- 
like figure to the distinctive realm of an ahistorical “Brāhmaṇism,” within which at this time, 
in fact, the evidence for a non-esoteric focus on the worship of Sarasvatī is somewhat meager. 
Rather, it is more plausible that both this triadic structure as well as the liberatory function of 
a “sattvic” goddess associated with Sarasvatī are inheritances from the Lākulas, or perhaps 
more pointedly, the Kārukas. As it may have begun to dawn on the reader, the sort of esoteric 
initiations we have just surveyed bear a striking resemblance to the initiation of the artisan with 
which we began to the chapter, although expressed in a much humbler fashion—the Kāruka, 
representing a liminal figure dwelling on the edge between the world of māyā, where “action” 
691Törzsök, The Doctrine of the Magical Female Spirits, xv. 
726 
predominates, and the pure realm of the Lākulas. From this perspective, though of course this 
mere speculation, the sort of discrepancies that Törzsök documents between a formally ideal 
assignment of functions among the three goddesses of the Trika according to the three guṇas 
of saṃkhyā and the messier realities found in our source texts is not a reflection of the 
artificiality of the Siddhayogeśvarīmata’s decidedly archaic triadic system. Instead, it 
represents the integration of the originally to some degree distinct and ontically superior Lākula 
and Kāruka goddess of language Vāgeśvarī within the older triad of Vāma, Jyeṣṭhā, and Raudrī, 
over whom she had previously been presiding from within the pure realm. 
Much as was the case with the Aparājitapṛcchā’s representation of the outwardly 
pacific goddess Kāmākhyā, iconographically identical to Sarasvatī, whose true nature is 
Bhairavī, down into the present day, the vernacular traditions of the artisans of the Deccan 
have remained much more in tune to this dual nature of their supreme goddess than are the 
early Trika scriptures. In fact, as we shall see momentarily, one of the shared features of artisan 
culture in the Deccan, evident in vernacular sources from at least the fourteenth century, is a 
consistent claim that their clan goddess is at once the Goddess of Language and Kālī or 
Bhairavī. Rather than this representing a “subalternization” of a more nuanced Trika theology, 
given the ubiquity of this dynamic, it seems more plausible that the scriptural foundations for 
the Trika itself need to be read as a specialized appropriation of older Atimārgic traditions, 
linked with artisanal and performance communities, which over time effectively colonized and 
partially replaced their antecedents, much in the same manner as we saw at Kukkunur in 
chapter 4 where the Mantramārga dominated the mental universe of the ostensibly Atimārgic 
Lākula Siddha Kaḷēśvara. 
727If these sources provide us with compelling hints of the general trajectory of the Lākula 
traditions and their ultimate absorption into the Bhairava Siddhānta, certain texts are even more 
forthcoming when it comes to the question of the Kārukas and their canons. In one of the 
longest passages in his Svacchanda Tantra commentary discussing the Lākulas, Kṣemarāja 
argues that Lakulīśa’s disciple Musulendra, sometimes simply called Mausula, extracted six 
subsidiary Pramāṇa [Tantra]s from the main canon of eight [Pramāṇas] “and propagated them 
independently for less advanced practitioners.” In writing about this passage, Alexis Sanderson 
has interpreted this statement as indicative of a distinction between the “gnostic” Lākula 
scriptures and another six-fold canon that deal with more mundane matters. These are then 
assigned to the Mausulas (one’s with clubs), plausibly conflated with the Kārukas.692 Rather 
invaluably for our purposes, in providing confirmation that Kṣemarāja’s doxographical scheme 
has a scriptural basis, Sanderson has directed our attention to the Jayadrathayāmala. This 
important and highly transgressive scripture, which offers a hodge-podge of elements drawn 
from lost archaic sources, also knows the Lākula Pramāṇaśāstras as “divided into eight 
primary, gnostic texts and six subsidiary texts concerned with ritual.”693 Building on 
Sanderson’s analysis, in his discussion of the evidence for the Vimalas found in early tantric 
doxographies, Acri694 concludes his own treatment of this canon by focusing on a different 
passage on the Lākulas found in Kṣemarāja’s commentary on Svacchanda Tantra (11.73), 
which Hans Bakker has translated in the following manner: 
“For, he who follows the Pramāṇa Śāstra and the Vaimala, His soul is purified by initiation and knowledge, by (keeping to) the prescribed praxis until death, while 
692Rather suggestively, the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā in cataloging a further set of eight traditions groups the Mausalin tradition shortly before the Vimalas. In fact, in order for the list on offer to represent eight traditions Śrīkaṇṭha, Somasiddhānta, Kaumāra, Mausali-[jājaliṃ?], Vimala, Aṭṭahāsa, and Ghorasvacchanda] the reading Mausali[jājaliṃ][ must be a compound delineating two traditions. Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā: śrīkaṇṭhasaumakaumāraṃ mausalijājaliṃ tathā / vimalaṃ cāṣṭahāsaṃ ca ghorasvacchandam aṣṭamam // 693Sanderson, “The Lākulas,” 172. 694Acri, “The Śaiva Atimārga in the Light of the Niśvāsaguhya.” 
728 
abiding by the Kapāla observance—he goes to that station that is his own.” The quarter- verse “His soul is purified by knowledge” indicates the difference here from the afore- mentioned Mausulas and Kārukas, who are devoted only to the observances that are chiefly ritualistic (kriyāpradhānavratamātraniṣṭha).695 
While Bakker here translates the term kriyāpradhāna as “chiefly ritualistic,” resulting 
in considerable conceptual unclarities, there is another possible way of interpreting this phrase 
suggested by the Tantric sources themselves. Thus, in situating its own place within the canon, 
the Pratiṣṭhā Tantra known as the Piṅgalāmata, composed perhaps in late eighth to early ninth 
century, tells us: 
The Jayadratha[yāmala] for its part is a sevenfold sūtra. The sūtra, the uttarasūtra and the śaktisūtra, the one known of as kriyā, the one called stainless [vaimala], the gnosis and the sarvasandoha is the seventh. Which is it in the middle of these classes of the seven types of sūtras? That is the kriyāsūtra. The kriyāsūtra also is fivefold, the divisions are arcanā, rakṣa, mantra, dhyāna, and kalpārtha. Kriyā is held to be a fivefold process, conjoined with the practice of craft (kalpārtha).696 
Pointing to the very same foundation as Sanderson—namely, the Jayadrathayāmala— 
in the Piṅgalāmata’s doxography, kriyā as a category comprises not only ritual but quite 
specifically incorporates the fashioning of objects, “kalpārtha,” the very sort of “craft” that the 
early Dharmaśāstra and Nīti texts describe as “the work of kārus and śilpins.” The Kriyasūtra 
sits wedged in between the Śaktisūtra and unmistakably the “stainless practice” associated with 
Acri’s Vimalas. It would seem that, unlike the Lākula who was defined as a religious 
professional, the Kāruka and the Vaimala abide in the world of māyā precisely because, in 
addition to the performance of rituals, they are engaged in worldly activities of manufacturing 
and perhaps, if we follow Acri’s analysis, performance by commission.

729 
While traces of the Kārukas may be found in the Niśvāsa corpus and the early Trika, it 
is another source that provides us with some of our most compelling indications of the organic 
and historically rooted nature of this artisan canon. This text is a perhaps ninth-century (or 
even slightly earlier) doxographical work (at least in terms of its surviving portions) drawn 
upon by the Trika exegetes, including Abhinavagupta, entitled the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā.697 
Though the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā has been frequently mined for its extensive catalogs of now 
mostly lost Tantric canons—a task that will also bear fruit in relation to our own interpretive 
project—little attention has been given to its own rhetorical agenda and theology, which in 
essence offers us an unexpurgated vision of the medieval sociology of knowledge as presented 
from a proudly Kaula perspective, one that has yet to commit to the type of hermeneutical 
heavy lifting undertaken by the Tantrāloka.698 
697 As preserved in the Nityādisaṃgraha of the Kashmiri Takṣakavarta, the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā was an important doctrinal and doxographical resource for both Kṣemarāja and Abhinavagupta. A diplomatic edition of this text, which reproduces verbatim the readings found in the manuscript without offering any emendation, is included as an appendix by Jürgen Hanneder in his edition and translation of the opening section of Abhinavagupta’s Mālinīślokavārttika. See Jürgen Hanneder, Abhinavagupta’s Philosophy of Revelation: An Edition and Annotated Translation of Mālinīśloklavārttika I, 1-399 (Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 1998), 237–268. For a pioneering analysis of this material, see Mark S. G. Dyczkowski, The Canon of the Śaivagāma and the Kubjikā Tantras of the Western Kaula Tradition (Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 1988). 698 It is from the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā that Abhinavagupta appears to derive his definition of Kula, as it appears in the Parātriṃśikāvivaraṇa, as that which is derived from the body. Our text gives a multipart definition, primarily doctrinal in nature, which is perhaps worth quoting in full: “He is called ‘Śākta’ who has obtained the union that consists of that, [namely,] the supreme reality that has as its very nature being entirely arising in all states of being. The body they call Kula. There is nothing that exists that is not Śiva. It is the producer of the fruit that is one’s true nature—there is nothing higher than that. That is known of as Kula which is established at the set of four—piṇḍa and so forth [piṇḍa, pāda, rūpa, rūpātīta]. It being dual, non-dual, and so forth, however, it is differentially established as being four-fold. Its defining feature is the dissolution of everything; from the revelation of the secret mantra. O goddess, that is called “Kaula” which is characterized as producing divine signs/spiritual experiences instantly.” Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā: nityoditasvarūpāṇi bhāvāni parmārthataḥ / tanmayaḥ prāptisaṃyogaḥ sa śāktaḥ parikīrtitaḥ // kulaṃ śarīram ity āhur nāśivaṃ vidyate kvacit / svabhāvaphalaniṣpattir nānyatparataraṃ punaḥ // piṇḍādi yaccaturthāntasaṃsthitaṃ tatkulaṃ smṛtam / dvaitādvaitādikaṃ santu taccaturdhā vyavasthitam // guhyamantraprakāśādi sarvasaṃhāralakṣaṇam / kaulārtham iti tad devi sadyaḥ pratyayakārakam // 
With the even more archaic Kulasāra, the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā seems to participate in a line of Kaula revelation, most of it associated with the western Deccan, where Kula and Kaula are defined in doctrinal philosophical terms. As will be shown in future publications, this same delineation of Kaula knowledge is reflected in the early Marathi sources. This seems to be in contradistinction with a geographically situated eastern tradition, best exemplified by the Kaulajñānanirṇaya or Kulacūḍāmaṇi, where very little if any of this doctrinal dimension is in evidence. 
730 
The Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā seems to be committed to the theological project of defining— 
or redefining—how Tantric knowledge is organized in a manner that ultimately privileges 
Kaula revelations. In carrying out this task, the text deploys a series of rather confusing 
correlative strategies with the aim of producing its own wholly synthetic totalizing taxonomy. 
Yet as part of this process, in eschewing an easy acceptance of the ready at hand oversimplified 
characterizations found in the “mainstream” literature, the work offers us a wealth of 
information about what Tantric knowledge looks like in the absence of selective curation. Now 
in our secondary literature, the focus of virtually all scholarly attention on this text has been 
the Śrīkaṇṭhīya’s rhetorical commitment to realigning the five streams of Tantric revelation 
with the five faces of the supreme Parameśvara in a manner that deprivileges the system of the 
Śaiva Siddhānta in favor of the Kaulas. Jürgen Hanneder, for instance, has been interested in 
this material because, as he argues, it is integral to Abhinavagupta’s Mālinīślokavārtika I. 1– 
399. As for Abhinavagupta’s investment with tweaking the five-fold cosmology, the reason 
why it might matter to him becomes immediately evident if you look at the diagram. What 
quickly becomes clear is that this classical model not only aligns the Śaiva Siddhānta—and the 
Śaiva Siddhānta alone—with soteriological concerns, but it at the same time it relegates the 
predecessors to Abhinavagupta’s preferred body of scriptures, namely, the Dakṣiṇa and the 
Vāma, to keep the company of traditions dedicated to the magical curing of snake bites and 
exorcism.

By positing that the supreme lord in fact has a “secret” sixth lower head that emits a higher 
order of revelation, aligned with Kaula gnosis, for Abinavagupta, the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā 
provides a solution to what otherwise might have seemed like an intractable problem. 
What has hardly been noticed, however, is that much more of the body of the text of 
the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā is devoted to a different and decidedly byzantine intellectual project 
centered around a totally different strategy. This project sets out to fit all the forms of esoteric 
knowledge within a subsidiary eight-fold organizational structure. Concisely, the 
Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā is heavily invested in associating a range of canons of knowledge, 
including the Rudrabheda, with the eightfold forms of Bhairava. Thus, once it has treated the 
lower forms of laukika knowledge, including the Veda, philosophy, and the Śivabheda 
division, roughly corresponding what we term Śaiva Siddhānta, the text, sometimes in a rather 
garbled broken fashion, proceeds to lay out its main agenda: “This is the division of the 
732 
Śivamantra[mārga]. In much the same manner, we will comment upon the eight divisions of 
Vāma and Dakṣiṇa[mārga], which are secondarily assigned to the place of the body, such as 
the head and so forth.”699 As we can see, our doxography is clearly in dialogue with the same 
types of organizational schemata, such as the Śaiva Puruṣasūkta we have exploring in this 
chapter. Sadly, in the only surviving manuscript the next sentence is missing a number of 
akṣaras. What it appears to say, however, is that it will explain the meaning of the śāstras 
(śāstrārthadarśaka) whose essential nature is “pūrva”700—here alas we find the hole—which 
is comprised of the streams (srotas) known of as pramāṇa and vaktṛ.701 These seem to 
correspond to the Dakṣiṇa and Vāma mārgas of the previous line. This interpretation will find 
further support some verses later, where a similar dichotomy will be drawn between the 
Rudrabheda of the Tantrikas (tantrikāṇām)—the Dakṣiṇa stream containing the eight-fold 
Bhairava canon—and the place of the mouth (vaktṛsthānāṃ) (i.e., the genitals), whose canon 
is innumerable (anekaśaḥ), a formulation that our text will assign to the Vāma stream that 
grandfathers its own Kaulism.702 
699Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā: tadvadvāmadakṣiṇabhedāṣṭau mūrdhnopalakṣitau vyākhyāsyāmaḥ / Notice that our Aiśa author treats the irregular numeral paradigm for aṣṭa as if it were a dual form and then erroneously changes lakṣita to lakṣitau to match. 700This could conceivably be a reference to the Mālinīvijayottara, for it is repeatedly referred to as Śrīpūrva by Abhinavagupta and his disciples. In more general terms, it could also provide us with an indication that our doxography remembers that the earliest predecessors to the Kaula traditions self-identified as belonging to a tradition called the Pūrva, of which the early canon of the Trika seems to have formed one particular subset. 701Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā: taccaikādaśabhedabhinnasambandhanimittabhedasaṃjñāpramāṇavaktṛśrota [two syllables missing] pūrvasvarūpaśāstrārthadarśako vaktavyaḥ / 702Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā: tantrikāṇāṃ rudrabhedaṃ vaktṛsthānām anekaśaḥ /

The key streams of Tantric Knowledge 
Vāma Vaktṛ Śākta Countless divisions 
Dakṣina Pramāṇa Tantrika Eight-fold Division Divided 24-fold 
At this point however, before it explores these canons, Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā 
unexpectedly swerves off in a rather different direction, offering an “explanation” of the term 
“pramāṇa” that strongly suggests its original equation with a canon of Lākula texts. Instead, 
playing upon the polyvalence of the term pramāṇa, the text informs us: 
Previously [in the discussion of philosophical schools,] the six veridical means of knowledge (pramāṇas), established as perception and so forth, were related. But, self- awareness (svasaṃvedanaṃ) is another, and likewise there is [spiritual] experience (anubhava). [In this way,] in this tradition coming from Śiva, the Pramāṇas are said to be eightfold. . . . What is this srotas?. . . . It has fallen to the earth from that mouth, and in this way there is said to an eightfold descent [of the revelation].703 
In the typical supersessionary fashion we find so often in Tantric discourse, in this 
second order Kaula formulation, the canon of the eightfold Pramāṇa scriptures of the Lākulas 
is homologized with the śāstric category of the pramāṇas as methods, like direct perception or 
inference, that make possible the acquisition of valid knowledge. To make the homology stick, 
703Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā: ṣaṭpramāṇāś ca pūrvoktāḥ pratyakṣādyāś ca ye sthitāḥ / svasaṃvedanam anyac ca tathā cānubhavaḥ smṛtaḥ / pramāṇaś cāṣṭadhā devi śaive ‘smin parigīyate. . . . kim idaṃ kena kasmāc ca srotaḥ. . . . tanmukhāt patitaṃ bhūmāv avatārāṣṭaketi ca / 
734 
the usual catalogue of six methods for arriving at knowledge accepted in learned discourse are 
now complemented by two new sources of authority: svasaṃvedanaṃ and anubhava. Each of 
these are only to be found, broadly speaking, in “Śākta” sources, and their elevation 
incidentally eerily prefigures the arguments of the Trika exegetes. The Aṣṭapramāṇa system of 
the Lākulas thus is no longer a term of art referring to the eight-fold division of what might by 
the time the Śrīkaṇṭhīya was composed have become a mostly lost canon of archaic scriptural 
authorities. Instead, it has been reinscribed as referring to those scriptures that accept eight 
veridical means of knowledge, which are comprised of the innumerable revelations that have 
been transmitted on the Dakṣiṇa and Vāma paths. That such a rhetorical choice represents a 
deliberate attempt to make sense of a Lākula past becomes more clear when we look— 
selectively, for the section is long and byzantine in its speciation—at the text’s initial treatment 
of the Dakṣiṇa stream: 
The Dakṣiṇa path is within the Dakṣiṇa stream; it is divided twenty-four-fold. In the midst of this is Mahāghora, Ghora, and Aghora. . . . [There are] Bhīma division, which is the highest, and the one called “Great Vetāla” Asitaṅga, Mahoccuṣma, Krodha, Unmattabhairava, the one called Caṇḍa, known of as the lotus, and Mahābhairava, the great peak. There is the Tantra called Siddhayogeśvarī, which arises from the Yoginījāla.704 
Essentially, the Dakṣiṇa stream is now organized around eight major Bhairavas, though 
the older Lākula logic of a triad of comprised of Aghora, Ghora, and Ghoratara persists in a 
vestigial form (as Aghora, Ghora, and Mahāghora). At least five of these names (Asitaṅga 
[sic], Mahoccuṣma, Krodha, Unmatta, and most importantly, Caṇḍa) are perfect matches for 
the standard list of the Aṣṭabhairavas. The others are eccentric. Such deviations likely represent 
704Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā: dakṣiṇe dakṣiṇaṃ mārgaṃ caturviṃśatibhedataḥ / teṣāṃ madhye mahāghoraṃ ghorāghoraṃ. . . . bhīmakhaṇḍa parākhyaṃ ca mahāvetālasaṃjñakam / asitaṅgaṃ mahocchuṣmaṃ krodham unmattabhairavam / caṇḍākhyaṃ kamalākhyaṃ ca mahābhairava-śekharam / siddhayogeśvarītantraṃ yoginījālasambhavam / 
735 
an archaic inheritance that our text has failed to fully digest or efface, as elsewhere our text 
knows and makes use of the standard canonical list, which more neatly aligns with its 
schematic. In any case, more pertinently for our purposes, this preliminary canon is then 
immediately followed by an invocation of the mūla Tantra of the Trika system, the 
Siddhayogeśvarī[mata]. 
Instead of representing a separate doctrinal school, the Siddhayogeśvarī is said to arise 
from the Yoginījāla, another unpublished work preserved within the Jayadarathayāmala that 
Alexis Sanderson has identified as incorporating substantial elements from Atimārgic 
scriptures. In essence, the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā’s commitment to an eightfold arrangement has 
been uncomfortably grafted onto this even more archaic systematicity, evoking precisely the 
older imaginary wherein the three divisions of the aghora mantra are used to schematize 
knowledge.705 Indeed, the Śrīkaṇṭhiyasaṃhitā’s treatment of the most important of these 
categories, that of Mahāghora, provides us with further evidence that this schematic represents 
the survival—or at least conscious creative redeployment—of bits and pieces of this older 
systematicity: 
In regard to the Mahāghora, I will tell you of the arising of the Dakṣiṇa stream. It is twenty-four-fold in its divisions and expanded into very many crores. 
The first is called Mahāghora. [The second] is the Bhairava Caṇḍa. [The third] is Lākula. [The fourth] [is Andhi?]. There is the Śrīpūrva [five, Mālinīvijayottara] And likewise there is the Vijñānabhairava [6], Aghorīśvarasvacchanda [7], Vidyāsvacchanda [8] and also the one known of as Svacchandasāra [9] and the Rasasvacchanda [10] and that Svacchanda characterized as the son of the king [11], and the independent [12] and likewise there is the Guhyasārasvacchanda, called 
705Providing further indication of just how archaic this threefold division must have been, it is also the organizational schematic that underlies the Brahmyāmala’s vision of the emanation of scripture. This has made clear by Shaman Hatley’s edition and translation of chapter 39, “The Exposition on the Streams of Revelation,” for in verses five and six, we learn that the threefold universe corresponds to three śaktis—Parā, Parāparā, and Aparā, corresponding to Aghora, Ghoraghora, and Ghoratara—and that these pervade the three worlds and bind human souls. Shaman Hatley, ed. and trans., The Brahmayāmalatantra or Picumata, Vol. 1, Chapters 1–2, 9–40 and 83 (Volume 1) (Pondicherry: Institut Français d’ Indologie/École française d’ Extrême-Orient, 2018), 431– 453.

Ceṭikā-tālakaṃ [13–14?], there is the Bindusvacchanda [15] Nādasvacchanda [16] and also the Rauravasvacchanda [17] Kāḷa-svacchanda 18) the one Daṇḍasvacchanda [19] and also the “Owl-svacchanda” [20], the Kramojjhitasvacchanda [21] the Sātopam Svacchanda [22] the Candragarbhasvacchanda which is worshipped by the gods [23] and called Mṛtyusvacchanda [24].706 Thus is proclaimed the Mahāghora, which number twenty-four-fold.707

737For our purposes, what is most interesting here is the beginning of this list. In sequence, 
it confirms the interconnected archaic logic we have encountered throughout this chapter, 
which associates the worship of Caṇḍeśvara, god of the Kārukas, and the category of the 
Lākula—our Kālamukhas, their ācāryas. If we treat these texts as imagined as emerging in 
chronological sequence, a frequent feature of this discourse, this Atimārga dyad is then 
succeeded in rapid sequence by two of the most famous works of Trika scripture, which then 
preface a huge canon of scriptures associated with Svacchanda Bhairava, the last of which is 
likely a form of the Netratantra. Intriguingly, unlike in the Svacchanda Tantra itself, where 
Svacchanda Bhairava represents the ultimate deity and the culmination of the eightfold canon, 
here Svacchanda is a type of Bhairava who assumes many forms, all of which fall under the 
Mahāghora category. This dynamic is very much in keeping with the proliferations of forms 
of deities—all labelled Svacchanda Bhairava but diverging substantively from the iconography 
outlined in the Svacchanda Tantra—that we keep encountering throughout the Deccan, most 
recently in the Aparājitapṛcchā itself, where the fifty-armed form of Svacchanda that descends 
into the world to be worshipped by the artisans and who presides over the eight Bhairavas is 
much more akin to the cosmic Mahābhairava in his iconography and character. 
Though we need not engage with its contents with the same degree of pedantic 
precision, the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā has equally illuminative things to say about the prehistory 
of the traditions that it characterizes as the Vāma and their relation to what we know perceive 
to be a series of discrete textual domains. Thus, after the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā’s discussion of 
ūlakādyaṃ tathaiva ca / kramojjhitaṃ ca sāṭopaṃ candragarbhaṃ surārcitam / mṛtyunāma caturviṃśaṃ mahāghoram udāhṛtam. 
738 
the Atimārgic divisions of the Mausali, [Jājali?], and the Vimala we encountered earlier,708 the 
text presents us with the following verses: 
Durvāsa, Mecaka, and likewise Sārasvatam, Jayadratha, and Phekkāram [conj. Pheṭkāra] are proclaimed to be the five. And within the Brahmayāmala the list is sevenfold, including Raktā and Lampaṭā.709 
708The whole passage is very peculiar and runs as follows: “Śiva, Śikhā, and likewise Jyotir, and Vimala is the fourth; from the vicinity of these ones, it was stated, thus, they go to being immortal. Mudrā, Maṇḍalapīṭha and likewise the Pañcapīṭha and likewise, the Vidyāpīṭha and thus there are proclaimed to be four pīṭhas collected together. Śrīkaṇṭha, Soma[siddhānta], Kaumara, Mausali, [Jājāli?], and likewise Vimala, and the Aṭṭahāsam and the Ghorasvacchanda is the eighth.” Śrīkaṇṭhaīyasaṃhitā: śivaḥ śikhā tathā jyotir vimalaś ca caturthakaḥ / ebhyaḥ sakāśād ākhyātaṃ tato ‘martyam upāgatam // mudrāmaṇḍalapīṭhaṃ tu pañcapīṭhaṃ tathaiva ca / vidyāpīṭhaṃ tathā proktaṃ catuṣpīṭhā tu saṃhitā // śrīkaṇṭhasaumakaumāraṃ mausalijājaliṃ tathā / vimalaṃ cāṣṭahāsaṃ ca ghorasvacchandam aṣṭamam // It is tempting to read the first set as an outline of the Atimārga, corresponding respectively to Pāśupata, Lākula, Kāruka, and Vaimala. While the categories of Mudrā, Maṇḍala, and Pīṭha as an organizational schematic reappears in the SKS’s discussion of types of Kaula traditions, the Pañcapīṭha does not, and it is tempting to connect it to the mention of Pañcaśiṣyas and Pañcācāryas found in Niśvāsamūla’s fourth chapter on initiation as well as in other parts of that corpus’s delineation of the contents of Atimārgic traditions in the orbit of the Lākulas. 709Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā: durvāsamecakaṃ caiva tathā sārasvataṃ param / jayadrathaṃ ca phekkāraṃ pañcamaṃ parikīrtitam // raktākhyaṃ lampaṭākhyaṃ ca saptadhā brahmayāmalam / 
The first of these, which our text alludes to as invoking the goddess Raktā and so forth, is the central pantheon of the Picumata itself. As Csaba Kiss has most recently discussed in his edition and translation of the relevant chapter where the system is introduced, paṭala three presents us with the core ritual system of the Picumata in which the Bhairava in the form of Kapālīśa is surrounded by four Devīs or Guhyakās: Raktā, Karālī, Caṇḍākṣī, Mahoccuṣmā. Csaba Kiss, ed. and trans., Brahmayāmalatantra or Picumata, vol. II: The Religious Observances and Sexual Rituals of the Tantric Practitioner: Chapters 3, 21, and 45 (Pondicherry: Institut français de Pondichéry / École française d’Extrême-Orient, 2015). As Kiss notes, somewhat strangely, though she is otherwise integral to the system in most other chapters, in paṭala three, the goddess Caṇḍā Kāpālinī who usually serves as Kapālīśa’s consort is never mentioned explicitly and is quite possibly absent. This would suggest that the division preserves an even more archaic tradition in which the skull-bearing Bhairava had no main partner, but was simply surrounded by the four devīs, indicating just how ancient Raktā and company might well have been. Indeed, so central are these four deities to the ritual life of the Brahmayāmala that elsewhere in the work, the core vidyā mantra of Caṇḍā Kāpālinī, oṃ/hūṃ caṇḍe kāpālini svāhā is accompanied by a visualization in which the syllables of the mantras are correlated with these four goddesses, who despite their names are white, red, yellow, and black in color. 
While Raktā and so forth are essential features of this system, in contrast Lampaṭā and her associates are decidedly more obscure. Kiss offers a whole series of tables of cataloging the various cycles of yoginīs that over time are integrated into the Brahmayāmala’s pantheon over the course of historical development of this heterogenous text. While Piṅgalā, for example, eventually makes an appearance, apart from one dubious instance that may be a copying error, Lampaṭā plays no meaningful role in this version of the system and is certainly not associated with her own pantheon. Albeit in passing, Abhinavagupta in fact himself refers to two such canons, one beginning with Raktā and the other Lampaṭā. 
Lampaṭā also seems to have been incorporated, likely from an independent source, into the root text of the Western Transmission, the Kubjikāmata. Though the Kubjikāmata Tantra is dedicated to the worship of the goddess Kubjikā, whose worship is closely associated with the Island of the Moon as well as Srisailam, here, Lampaṭā is assigned to the abode of the island of Sri Lanka (Siṃhala), a rather marginal place suggestive of her origins as lying outside this system. As one name among many, she appears surrounded by Krūrā, Piṅgalā, Khaḍgikā, Damṣṭrālī, Rākṣasī, Dhvāṅkṣī, Lolupā, Lohitāmukhī, Bahavāśī, Virūpā, Āmiṣapriyā, and Satī, and indeed her 
739 
Unmistakably, the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā’s initial discussion of the contents of this 
portion of the Vāma canon corresponds almost perfectly with the Piṅgalāmata’s own 
discussion of its place within the field of Tantric textuality. This fact is particularly interesting, 
for in this section the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā itself is just about to identify the Piṅgalāmata as the 
most recent work within this very stream of revelation. In the Piṅgalāmata, which as we shall 
see is perhaps our most precious resources in stepping into the world of the Tantric artisan, this 
self-reflection on the point of origin of Śākta artisanal discourse immediately prefaces the 
passage we have just be exploring characterizing the nature of kriyā and its relation to the 
practice of craft (kalpārtha).710 
name mysteriously appears twice in the list. Additionally, in the Liṅga Purāṇa, in its twenty third chapter, which is dedicated to the ablution conducted for the sake of victory of a king, Lampaṭā also briefly surfaces and once again she is mentioned twice. The ritual system is centered on the goddess Manomanī, who is surrounded by an enormous litany of āvaraṇas (Liṅga Purāṇa 2.27), each of which in turn has a multitude of subdivisions. Lampaṭā appears here first after the second āvaraṇa of the Dakṣa group, which though the text does not specify it here, earlier in the work was identified as the Paiśācikā grouping of the third āvaraṇa. In the first case, she is grouped with Sarasvatī, Viśvarupā, Āmiṣapriyā, Dīrghadāṃṣṭrā, Vajrā, Lamboṣṭhī, and Prāṇahāriṇī, who form a subsidiary canon of subordinate deities to Citrā, Victrarūpā, Śubhadā, Kāmadā, Śubhā Krūrā, Piṅgalā, Khaḍgikā, Lambikā, Satī, Daṃṣṭrālī, Rākṣasī, Dhvāṃsī, Lolupā, Lohitā, and Mukhī. In the second case, she appears alongside Kulāntikā, Nalā, Pracaṇḍā, Mardinī, Sarvabhūtabhayā, Dayā, Vāḍavāmukhī, Pannagā, Kusumā, Vipulāntakā, Kedārā, Kūrmā, Duritā, Mandodarī, and Khaḍgacakrā, who are subordinated to Nandinī, Pheṭkārī, Krodhā, Haṃsā, Ṣaḍaṅgulā, Ānanda, Vasudurgā, and Saṃhārā. 
The passages in question show obvious signs of a partial and perhaps failed attempt at domesticating these beings and subordinating them to a Śaiva Siddhānta focused pantheon. Nevertheless, once one sorts out from the mix many of the rather generic names the Liṅga Purāṇa has incorporated, such as giver of good fortune (Śubhadā) or giver of desire (Kāmadā), elements of a shared core pantheon begins to emerge, though there are slight variations in names: Krūrā, Piṅgalā, Khaḍgikā, Damṣṭrālī, Rākṣasī, Lolupā, and Lohitāmukhī appear in both lists in virtually the same order, with the variant of the Dhvāṅkṣī in the Kubjikāmata being replaced by Liṅga Purāṇa’s Daṃṣṭrālī, Sarvāsatī and Viśvarūpā replacing Bahavāśī and Virūpā, which almost looks like the end result of some copying errors. Intriguingly, other elements that are also incorporated into the Piṅgalāmata’s description of its textual genealogy, such as Pheṭkārī and an allusion to the Sārasvata mata not only surface here, but also in the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā. 710In “The Śaiva Exegetes of Kashmir,” Alexis Sanderson presents us with a largely parallel passage in the Jayadarathayāmala, quite possibly inherited from its antecedents associated with the Vāma stream and affiliated with the cult of Tumburu. This also identifies seven streams of scripture coming from the Brahmayāmala, and once again, the majority of this same canon is in evidence. “This one Brahma[yāmala] has divided into seven to meet the wishes of those to whom it was to be taught: Raktāmata, Pecikāmata, Śṛgālīmata/Pherāmata, Śambarāmata, Nīlakeśīmata, Bhāruṇḍāmata/Bhāruḍīmata, and Piṅgalāmata, together with the Utphullakamata (for the Śambarāmata has this as one of its two divisions). Thus, O doe-eyed one, I have told you the eight extensive Mata texts that are within this Tantra Brahmayāmala.” Alexis Sanderson, “The Śaiva Exegetes of Kashmir,” in Mélanges Tantrique à la Mémoire d'Hélène Brunner. Tantric Studies in Honor of Hélène Brunner, 
740 
Now this part, falling within the Brahmayāmala, derived from Durvāsa is Paicika [that which is from the Picumata]. It is of the doctrine of the Sārasvatas and it is proclaimed as Jayadratha’s fifth howling [pheṭkāra]. The Brahmayāmala, comprised of [the pantheon of] Raktā and so forth and [the pantheon of the] lustful dog-faced one and so forth [Lampaṭā] is divided sevenfold. Which is it among the middle of these seven divisions of the Brahmayāmala? 
This is the Jayadratha; the Jayadratha for its part is a sevenfold sūtra. . . . The Sūtra, the Uttarasūtra and the Śaktisūtra, the one known of as Kriyā, the one called stainless [Vaimala], the gnosis and the Sarvasandoha is the seventh. Which is it in the middle of these classes of the seven types of sūtras? That is the Kriyāsūtra. The Kriyāsūtra also is fivefold, the divisions are arcanā, rakṣa, mantra, dhyāna, and kalpārtha. Kriyā is held to be a fivefold process, conjoined with the practice of craft (kalpārtha).711 
It would seem that, at least in the ninth century, in contrast with their nebulous 
perception of the contents of the Lākula canon and rest of the Atimārga, our sources envisioned 
the above Vāma scriptures as texts with genealogical connections with each other that 
contained a specific content—and that scriptural content is quite explicitly connected with the 
artisan profession, or the practice of craft (kalpārtha). With this in mind, let us return the 
Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā’s delineation of what it views as the rest of this interrelated subset of the 
Vāma canon: 
There is the Haṃsapārameśvara, Yakṣiṇī[pārameśvara], Mātaṅga[pārameśvara], Ekavīra[pārmeśvara], Ambu[pārameśvara], and the Puṣkara[pārameśvara]. It was compiled by Vāmadeva as being the sevenfold Pārameśvara canon—this is repeated as 
ed. Dominic Goodall and André Padoux (Pondicherry: Institut Français de Pondichéry / École française d’Extrême-Orient, 2007), 249. 
Sanderson emends the Piṅgalāmata’s passage to bring it into conformity with the Jayadrathayāmala’s readings. I would suggest however, that while the two descriptions reflect related systemizations, the two canons are presented as not being identical, and that is a deliberate choice on the part of their respective composers. For, as we saw in footnote 43, Abhinavagupta’s disciples and commentators know precisely of this same division into raktādya and lampaṭādya pantheons and use the terms in a manner where they do not merely represent the names of texts. Furthermore, the two texts classify each other using different strategies; the Piṅgalāmata itself occupies an entirely different place in the Jayadrathayāmala’s taxonomy and the Piṅgalāmata in turn places the Jayadratha in a different place within the hierarchy of texts. 711Piṅgalāmata: idānī brahmayāmalasyāntapatityāṃśakadaurvāsyaṃ paicikaṃ caiva sāraśvatamataṃ tathā / jayadrathaṃ ca phetkāraṃ pañcamam parikīrttitam // raktādyaṃ laṃpaṭādyañ ca saptadhā brahmayāmalam / eteṣāṃ saptavidhabrahmayāmalānāṃ madhye kimiti / jayadratham etat jayadratham api saptavidhāsutram / sūtram uttarasūtrañ ca śaktisūtraṃ kriyāhvayaṃ // vimalaṃ jñānaṃsamjñaṃ ca sarvasandoha saptamam / eteṣāṃ saptavidhasūtrajātīnāṃ madhye kimiti / kriyāsūtram etat / kriyāsūtram api pañcavidhaḥ vibhāgārcanarakṣāmantradhyānasamanvitaḥ / kalpārthasanniyuktā pañcātra kriyā matā / 
741 
per the Haṃsapārameśvara. The Pāṭapārameśvara, Yakṣiṇī[pārameśvara] along with the one called Haṃsa[pārameśvara] are not very long with only a lakh of verses. But the Yakṣiṇīpārameśvara is said to be ninefold [lakhs of verses]. 
The 1) Kiraṇa, 2) Nandimata, 3 Haṃsinī 4) Brahmamaṇḍala 5) Svāyambhuva 6) Skandamata 7) Pratiṣṭhāpārameśvara, [form the] Liṅgakalpa along with the Gārgīya, which extends nine koṭis. 
That Tantra called Mataṅga is said to be threefold. The Kalpaśākhā, Mātaṅga, and the Mṛgendra. The Ekavīra is said to be twofold, it is known to have three and a half lakhs. 
And the Paitāmaha [Brahmayāmala?] and the mother Ekavīra; one called Amba, one called the Guhyasūtra and another called the Piṅgalāmata, are said to have five divisions; the ocean of dīkṣā consists of the six pratiṣṭhās. Thus, it is said to be fivefold [in its division]. 712 
Regarding the texts mentioned in this passage as well, there are considerable 
indications that we are talking about a real and not an imagined Kāruka or artisan corpus. 
Unexpectedly, our confirmations in this regard are to be found not in the Kāpālika tinged 
discourses of the Jayadrathayāmala, but almost exclusively in the relatively staid scholastic 
tradition surrounding the Śaiva Siddhānta. Thus, for example, in a work whose explicit purpose 
is demonstrating that the Mataṅgapārameśvara is a Tantra of the Śaiva Siddhānta, the dualistic 
late ninth-century Kashmiri Śaiva Siddhānta author Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha II begins his 
commentary by distinguishing the text he is commenting on from the Haṃsapārameśvara, 
Yakṣiṇī[pārameśvara], and Pauṣkarapārameśvara.713 While portions of the first and last of 
712Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā: durvāsamecakaṃ caiva tathā sārasvataṃ param / jayadrathaṃ ca phekkāraṃ pañcamaṃ parikīrtitam raktākhyaṃ lampaṭākhyaṃ ca saptadhā brahmayāmalam / haṃsa-yakṣiṇi-mātaṅgam ekavīrāmbupuṣkaram / vāmadevena saṃhitāṃ saptadhā pārameśvaram / haṃsapārameśvaraṃ yattadvidhā paripaṭhyate/ pāṭayakṣiṇi-sahaṃsākhyaṃ lakṣair navativistaram / yakṣiṇī parameśaṃ ca navadhā paripaṭhyate / kiraṇākhyaṃ nandimataṃ haṃsinī brahmamaṇḍalam svāyaṃbhuvam skandamataṃ praiṣṭhāpārameśvaram / liṅgakalpaṃ sagārgīya navakoṭipravistaram / mātaṅgākhyaṃ ca yattantraṃ tridhā tatparipaṭhyate / kalpaśākhā tu mātaṅgamṛgendrākhyā ca saṃhitā / ekavīraṃ dvidhā bhadre sārdhalakṣatrayaṃ viduḥ / paitāmaham ekavīrambākhyaṃ pañcadhā tathā / aṃbāsaṃjñaṃ guhyasūtraṃ tathānyat piṅgalāmatam / pratiṣṭhāṣaṭkadīkṣārṇaṃ ity etat pañcadhā sthita / 713For Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha II’s commentary, see N. R. Bhatt, ed., Mataṅgapārameśvara Vidyāpada (Institut Francais D’Indologie, Pondicherry, 1977), 19: idaṃ mātaṅgaṃ pārameśvaram ucyate / na tu yakṣinīpārameśvara pauṣkarapārameśvaraṃ vā pārameśvaratve ’pīti / 
742 
these survive in manuscript, we also we have range of distinctive citations drawn from works 
like the Paitāmaha and Pratiṣṭhāpārameśvara.714 Once again, however, these are primarily 
found—as late as the thirteenth century—in paddhatis associated with the Śaiva Siddhānta. 
Indeed, one of the most peculiar features of the above list of works is that, with the sole 
exception of the Piṅgalāmata, all of the above titles to which we have access, purportedly 
pertaining to kriyā and pratiṣṭhā, the Mataṅgapārameśvara, the Mṛgendra, the Kiraṇa, the 
Svāyambhuva, the Pauṣkarapārameśvara, and, assuming it corresponds to the text included in 
the Niśvāsa, the Guhyasūtra, come down to use classified as works of the Śaiva Siddhānta. 
Now at first glance, to even consider questioning the canonicity of a text like the 
Mataṅgapārameśvara might seem akin to accusing the Pope of not being Catholic. After all, 
it is the Mataṅga’s enormous Vidyāpāda that becomes the key point of reference for the later 
exegetical and ritual tradition’s codification of what constitutes a Śaiva Siddhānta cosmology. 
Nevertheless, as we saw in chapter 4, this is also the same text which in its Caryāpāda transmits 
the most substantial unexpurgated account of the skull-bearing Lākula Mahāvrata that survives 
in our literature. And yet, the provenance of this discovery has been scantly reflected upon. As 
we shall soon see, even a cursory examination of our source suggests that the presence within 
this scripture of Lākula vows is not a fortuitous accident or incidental act of interpolation, but 
rather indicative of a range of striking continuities, most evident in the sections on ritual, 
between the Mataṅga’s Kriyā and Caryāpādas and the intertangled worldviews of the 
Śivadharmaśāstra, the Atimārga, the Bhairava Siddhānta, and the Vāma.715 
714 See Alexis Sanderson, “The Śaiva Literature.” Journal of Indological Studies 24 & 25 (2012–2013), 2014: 27. 715In light of the arguments beings made in the present chapter, the beginning of Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha II’s commentary on the Mataṅga needs to be read in an entirely new light: “Others, however, say that the first non- canonical portion (utsūtra) of this śāstra has as its defining characteristic belonging to the Śaiva [discourse] from the Lākulas, Mausulas, etc., but although this being the case/in that very same section, they describe it as being Siddhānta from the other streams—the Vāma, Dakṣiṇa, Gāruḍa, and Bhūtatantras. That is not reasonable, because this meaning [i.e., that it is properly Śaiva] will be stated by the sūtras themselves. Now, for the sake of purifying 
743 
Indeed, it is worth pausing to survey some of the key chapters in the Mataṅga on ritual 
that offers us an encapsulated vision of dimensions of the work likely inherited from Atimārga 
contexts such as the Lākula tradition. Elsewhere, first of all, I have discussed in some detail 
both the considerable theological commitments to an effusive bhakti worldview integral to the 
Mātaṅga’s opening narrative as well as how the ninth-century Śaiva Siddhānta commentator 
Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha II uses exegetical wizardry to denude the work of such connotations.716 
What has yet to be observed, in contrast, is that this same bhakti sensibility is everywhere in 
evidence in the ritual portion of the text and that it is repeatedly and explicitly associated with 
the teachings of the Śivadharmaśāstra, both through the invocation of the authority of the work 
and through innumerable textual parallels.717 In fact, the opening two verses of the first chapter 
the commencement [of the text], because of its non-canonicity, it is absolutely necessary to make an uproar having inculcated the context/unwanted results.” Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha II on Mataṅgapārameśvara, Vidyāpāda, pg. 3: anye tu prathamam evotsūtram asya śāstrasya lākulamausalādibhyaḥ śaivatvena viśeṣaṃ, tatrāpi śroto’ntarebhyo vāmadakṣiṇagāruḍabhūtatantrebhyaḥ siddhāntatayā varṇayanti / tad uktaṃ, sūtrair evāsyārthasya vakṣyamāṇatvāt / athopakramaśobhārtham avaśyam eva prasaṅgam utpādya utsūtratayā kalakala kāryaḥ // Responding to a rich lost canon of Mataṅga commentaries, despite his protestations to the contrary that this is a proper work of the Śaiva Siddhānta, Rāmakaṇṭha all but tells us that most other readers have either assigned the work to the Atimārga traditions of the Lākulas and Mausalas, or else identified it as a properly “Tantric” text within the system of fivefold streams propagated especially in the Śākta sources. 716Jason Schwartz, “Caught in the Net of Śāstra: Devotion and its Limits in an Evolving Śaiva Corpus,” Journal of Hindu Studies 5, no. 2 (2012): 210–231. 717To offer a by no means comprehensive but representative list, 2.2.46 echoes Svetāśvatara Upaniṣad in the significance of bhakti (kṛtvā yajet paraṃ devaṃ bhaktyā tu parayā sadā) in the context of telling us that, performed with devotion, the two kinds of baths destroy all sins. Kriyāpāda 3.77–3.78 enjoins that bilva leaves are to be offered out of bhakti (bilvapatraiḥ prakartavyā bhaktitaḥ saṃbhavo yathā) and alludes to a previously mentioned injunction, which asserts that bhakti is for the purpose of ensuring liberation (vidhiḥ proktaḥ prasiddhyarthaṃ muktyai bhaktis tu kāraṇam). 2.3.100, in turn, tells us that worship conducted with bhakti destroys all sin and that without such service, when the body comes to its end, the transmigrating soul remains under the sway of its amassed karmas (evaṃ yaḥ pratyahaṃ bhaktyā saṃpūjyati kāraṇam / na tasya jāyate pāpaṃ yathādityodayāttamaḥ / naivābhyupaiti dehānte karmāśayavasāj jagat). In chapter five, in the context of talking about the naivedya, after speaking once again about a previously mentioned vidhi, the text rather emphatically tells that here bhakti alone is the cause of liberation (siddhaye ca yataḥ puṃsāṃ bhaktir evātra kāraṇam / pg. 106). Chapter 8 has an extended discussion, given below, where the Śivadharma is explicitly invoked as the guiding authority: 
Mataṅgapārameśvara, Kriyāpāda, pg. 162–65, vs. 8.10–18: prāgdharmanirgamo yo hi śivadharmasamāgamaḥ // sā muktir muniśārdūla nāsadvyaktim upaiti hi / sato ’pi neṣyate nāśo vicārāt paśutā paśoḥ // yāti māyātmikā yadvad gandhād gandhāntaram tathā / anādivāsanāviddhā paśoḥ pāśavaśāt sphuṭam // nimajjaty abhilāṣeṇa cittir yā cādhvani sthitā / sā tasya śaktisaṃsparśāt karmaṇo samatāṃ param // prāpyābhivyaktim āyāti yayā yukto ’ṇur mārgate / guror anugrahaṃ so ’pi niyuktaḥ parameṣṭhinā // gurus taṃ praty anāyāsaṃ śaktyāviṣṭaḥ pravartate /. . . . na karmaṇaḥ kṣayo ’nāder na malasyāśayātmanaḥ / na bhavet kālasāmarthyāt svato vāpi dvijottama // yasmin 
744 
of the Mataṅgapārameśvara’s kriyā division, the chapter on dīkṣā offers from its inception 
unmistakable paraphrases of the first chapter of the Śivadharmaśāstra, for we are told that its 
teaching on dīkṣā is offered of out compassion for all (sarvaṃ anukampayā), and that “this 
represents an easy means (sukhopāyam idaṃ) that takes the form of a procedure instructed by 
the guru that operates for the benefit of the world.”718 
Having introduced the importance of this devotional framework, and its distinctiveness 
from the ways of the world, the Mataṅga next reflects on the importance of the pañcamudrā. 
Though here the term no longer refers to the five signs of a Kāpālika, the significance assigned 
to this inherited category is at the very least suggestive of its more macabre antecedents. After 
this, we are introduced to the navapīṭha-maṇḍala, which is main ritual tool in this system. 
Once again, this is a formal feature that the Mataṅga shares with the Picumata Brahmayāmala, 
the Svacchanda, and pratiṣṭhā works of Śākta artisan communities, but that is absent from the 
mainline Śaiva Siddhānta. The Mataṅga then proceeds to introduce a key part of its eccentric 
mantra system. Much as we have seen in our Kālamukha sources, to a much greater degree 
than in normative Siddhānta works, the system heavily privileges the pañcākṣarī mantra, the 
nirabhilāṣī syāt samaye ‘ṇur vibhor balam / balāc chaktikarādvyaktaṃ kṣaṇād bhogād vijyujyate // sthityarthaṃ yo ’bhilāṣo ’sya mumukṣor bhāvitātmanaḥ / bandhahetur na boddhavyaḥ śivaprītyātmakas tu saḥ // 
The Caryāpāda makes the claim that the model for the samayin is the Śivabhakta as understood in terms of the theology of the Śivadharma and his or her observances follow those of the Śivadharmaśāstra as meditated through the Lākula cult of Vāgeśvarī. Thus, the Śiva bhakta should be seen (draṣṭavya) as being just like Śiva (śivavat) and learned people are not to discriminate regarding them following the standards of the world (na ca tān prati kartavyo vicāro laukiko budhaiḥ). Such people have been purified by the mantras that are Śiva as deployed by the guru whose form is Śiva. And because they have all been reborn from the womb of Vāgīśī (vāgīśīgarbhasaṃbhūtāḥ) they have all obtained the state of being the best of men (prāptavarā narāḥ)—in other words, they as Brāhmaṇas, such that they all possess the common storehouse of qualities recalled from the vidhi, in other words, the Śivadharma. While such communities observe social hierarchies that privilege seniority in practice, the text informs us this is merely for the sake of worldly convention. The sādhaka, putraka and ācāryā all not only observe the same Śivadharmaśāstra (sādhakendraḥ sa śivaśāsanatatparaḥ) but they are entrusted with both enforcing its application among the community and ensuring the protection of the community’s samaya from outside forces (śāsanasyānupālane). 718Mātaṅgapārameśvara, Kriyāpāda, 2.1.1. 
745 
sāvitrī/gāyatrī, and the pañcabrahma mantras. As in the Lākula derived analysis transmitted 
by Kṣemarāja, our text also invests enormous significance in the mantra connected with Śarva, 
which will appear again and again throughout the major rituals of the system. Bhairava’s bīja 
hūṃ, both in connection with phaṭ and serving as an astramantra and used independently, is 
similarly ubiquitous.719 The chapter ends first by invoking the deity Caṇḍīśa,720 equipped with 
an independent mantra system and maṇḍala, as the supreme god, and by praising Srisailam as 
the supreme sacred place. Shortly before doing so, however, it extols the virtues of knowing 
the Pramāṇa and the Āgama, a trace reference to the Lākula canon that somehow escaped the 
redaction process (pramāṇāgamaṃ buddhvā).721 Succinctly, were one to come to this chapter 
with no preconceived notions, neither its formal nor doctrinal character would in any way 
suggest an affiliation with the Śaiva Siddhānta. 
The other way in which the Mataṅga, and the other texts with which it keeps company, 
diverges radically in its focus from the early Śaiva Siddhānta is much less self-evident, but 
perhaps just as important. One of the most striking discoveries of the past several decades that 
has emerged from the painstaking efforts of Dominic Goodall and his colleagues at 
Pondicherry is the realization that, quite unlike the later southern tradition, where Śaivāgama 
as a category is virtually synonymous with temple culture, the oldest portions of Śaiva 
Siddhānta discourse are entirely devoid of any discussions of temple worship and its 
719Along similar lines, one would hardly expect a work of Śaiva Siddhānta to catalog the appearance in dreams of kāpalavratins whose bodies are made white by ash or to see the gods and the yoginīs at the end of the dream as “a good omen,” and yet our text does just that, grouping them alongside visions of śivabhaktas as fierce Tantric adepts. Mataṅgapārameśvara, Kriyāpāda, pg. 140, vs. 6.63–65: kapālavratinaḥ śastāḥ sitabhasmojjvalāḥ śūbhāḥ // jaṭāmakuṭamūrdhānaḥ śivabhaktāś ca ye narāḥ / devān paśyanti svapnānte yogīnīś cāpi śobhanāḥ // vidvāṃsaḥ sādhavo vīrāḥ praśasyante munīśvara / 720 An examination of the supreme god Caṇḍīśa/Caṇḍeśvara, who also plays a pivotal role in the Piṅgalāmata, will form an integral component of the concluding section of the present chapter. 721Mātaṅgapārameśvara, Kriyāpāda, 2.1.121: śivakāyodbhavāḥ sarve na mīmāṃsyāḥ kubuddhibhiḥ / pramāṇāgamaṃ buddhvā śraddhā kāryā vimuktaye /

surrounding festival life. Not only that, but they also lack any discussions of temple design, or 
urban layout, treatments of the crafting of mūrtis, or investment in the idea of processional. 
Succinctly, procedures for manufacturing and installing a śivaliṅga are nowhere to be found 
in this early stratum, for as Goodall observes,722 even in the seventh-century 
Svāyambhuvasūtrasaṃgraha, the preferred method for acquiring a liṅga among Śaiva 
Siddhānta adepts is to steal one (liṅgaparigraha) from another community. Goodall has 
dedicated a recent article to exploring the only exception to this dynamic, which offers a 
fascinating account of pratiṣṭhā that for perhaps the only time in our literature involves no 
installation of prāṇa into the image.723 Here, it is true, the ritual installation is performed by a 
sthāpaka and śilpins who are all householders, and not by a sādhaka, but the work in question 
is the Niśvāsaguhya, which is very plausibly the same Guhyasūtra that the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā 
treats as a part of this shared non-Siddhāntika canon. Thus, most unlike the world of the 
Kālamukhas, Śaiva Siddhānta discourse provides either no or little indication that practitioners 
within its discourse had any sort of substantive social ties or client patron relationships with 
the various iterations of artisan communities. 
In considerable contrast, the Mataṅga exudes a ready familiarity with and access to the 
world of śilpins and other craftsmen, which it repeatedly mentions are deserving reverence and 
substantial compensation. Thus, chapter thirteen of the Kriyāpāda, on the installation of liṅgas, 
begins with an inquiry into such śilpin guild secrets as how to pick a stone and to determine its 
gender, incorporates the bringing of the liṅga into a temple and the raising of the marks that 
bring it to life, discusses the design and preparation of pīṭha and piṇḍikā, and enjoins that all 
722See Dominic Goodall, “On Image-Installation Rites (liṅgapratiṣṭhā) in the Early Mantramārga,” in Consecration Rituals in South Asia, ed. István Keul (Leiden: Brill, 2017), 46–47. 723Goodall, “On Image-Installation Rites.” 
747of this to be carried out by śivabhaktas working with an ācārya. Though somewhat terse, for 
example, chapter 14, on the making of images using the pañcabrahma mantras, opens by 
extolling as especially important “viśeṣa aghora”—a thinly veiled form of Bhairava. It then 
offers some brief iconographical guidelines for crafting a delimited canon of deities matching 
the stripped-down ritual system we have seen earlier, which only partially coincides with that 
of the Siddhānta before moving on to common deities like a four-armed form of Viṣṇu and 
Sūrya. Even more tellingly, in the caryā division of the text, we are met with a wide variety of 
options when it comes to material culture within a community of śivabhaktas, and it is tempting 
to think of the range of prescriptions for different colored clothing, for āsanas made of freshly 
woven cloth, for ruby, pearl, or gold crests in one’s top knot, and for various types of earrings 
as speaking to an established social economy associated with specific populations who are able 
to provide such goods and services. Indeed, offering a social vision very much unlike the one 
found in the Śivadharmaśāstra, the fourth chapter of the Mataṅga’s Caryāpāda can perhaps 
be read as alluding to this very state of affairs: 
The samayin, with his whole being, should always be dependent upon the guru: this is clear. When this happens, then he will become one whose nature is to be released, and there is no other way to become released. Having taken the initiation that bestows liberation, the samayin resides [there] like a servant (dāsavat). This is his caryā for the sake of liberation; this is his eternal praiseworthy kriyā.724 
The domain of kriyā—inclusive of the crafting of things (kalpārtha)—is of course the 
very same focus that a range of sources have ascribed to the lost canon of the more marginal 
branches of the Atimārga—exemplified by the Kārukas—comprised of classes of initiates who 
serve their Lākula masters. You may remember that this six-fold canon of these scriptures, 
724Mataṅgapārameśvara, Caryāpada, pg. 355, 4.2–3: samayī sarvadāyatto guroḥ sarvātmanā sphuṭam / yadā tadā sa muktātmā nānyathā mucyate bhavāt // dāsavan nivasen nityaṃ dīkṣām āśritya mokṣadām / caryaiṣā muktaye tasya praśastā śāśvatī kriyā // 
748 
pertaining to “lesser matters,” were said to have been extracted by Mausulendra from the lost 
Hṛdayapramāṇa of the Lākula Pramāṇaśāstra. Just as was the case with the Pramāṇas 
themselves, whatever the original contents of these Kāruka scriptures, by the ninth century, 
they have become identified with the still extant canon on Pratiṣṭhā and Kriyā. This is said to 
have been comprised of the various iterations of the Pārameśvara scriptures, in which the 
Mataṅga is included, comprised of seven divisions, another seven works that make up “the 
liṅga kalpa” and, finally another five-fold canon, which concludes with the Guhyasūtra and 
the Piṅgalāmata. It is all of these works that seem to be the intended referent for what the 
Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā calls “the ocean of dīkṣā comprised of the six [works] on pratiṣṭhā, which 
is established in five divisions (pratiṣṭhāṣaṭkadīkṣārṇaṃ ity etat pañcadhā sthitam).” Where 
the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā speaks of the “the six Pratiṣṭhās,” its intended point of reference is in 
fact the six subsidiary Pramāṇas, In other words, by the ninth century, the texts we have just 
exploring—to say nothing of the Piṅgalāmata—offer some approximation of the type of 
“religious education” that a work of artisan ritual such as the Aparājitapṛcchā presupposed 
would form the common frame of reference for any prospective reader.

The Artisan as a Social Agent 
Placing the artisan as yogin doxographically has proven a terribly convoluted process, albeit 
one that has hopefully yielded constructive insights. Once we have this framework in mind, 
however, placing him sociologically—as someone who is at once a householder and yogin and 
thus straddles the divide between laukika and lokottara—proves rather straightforward. 
Already in the normative Dharmaśāstra, numerous features of how Kārukas and śilpins 
(for the two terms are increasingly conflated as the centuries progress) are to be treated by the 
general society are indicative of their liminal status, most unlike the Lākulas/Kālamukhas, as 
750 
quasi-religious professionals. Thus, for example, while outlining the conditions under which 
substances need to be purified, the Yājñavalkyasmṛti tells us that in exactly the same manner 
as the food that is received as alms when one is begging, the hand of kāruka (kāruhastaḥ) is 
always pure (śūciḥ).725 In doing so it, it seems to be invoking a proof text of considerable 
antiquity, one older than almost all of classical Sanskrit discourse, for the very same statement 
is already present, assigned to an unnamed older tradition, in Āpastamba’s third century BCE 
Dharmasūtra. And much as is the case with non-varṇāśramadharmin religious communities, 
as we saw in the third chapter, in our study of the differentiational application of dharma 
(dharmavyavasthā)—even in sources where neither the theological dimensions of their 
discourse nor the specific relationship of the dependence of artisan scriptures on a higher canon 
are in evidence—śilpin and Kāruka communities are said to be at once governed by their own 
rules and subject to the direction of their guiding authorities. Indeed, Bṛhaspati’s discussion of 
the social place of śilpins provides us with useful further context of sort that will help us fit all 
the pieces we have been assembling together into a single coherent picture. 
That one is called a śilpin by men who is a knower of the arts (kalābhijñaḥ), who fashions things made from gold, base metal, or cord, wood, stone, or hide. Where the gold workers and so forth, having become incorporated, enact śilpa, they would obtain payment according to their work, in accordance with the portion done. Śilpins who possess skill and knowledge in regard to teaching are called ācāryas. 
According to their rank, they would obtain one, two, three, or four times the normal share of payment. . . . As for the dharma of the actors, by good people, it is said that one who knows the beats obtains half a share, but singers have equal portions.726 
725Yājñavalkyasmṛti 1.187: kāruhastaḥ śuciḥ paṇyaṃ bhaikṣaṃ yoṣinmukhaṃ tathā // Yājñavalkya inherits this parallel from Manu 5.129: nityaṃ śuddhaḥ kāruhastaḥ paṇye yac ca prasāritam / Mānu in turn may be deriving the phrase from the Kṛṣṇa Yājurveda’s Vaikhānasagṛhyasūtra (khaṇḍa 24, part 30.11), which reads: yoṣidāsyaṃ kāruhastaḥ prasāritapaṇyaṃ ca sarvadā śūddhaṃ śakunyucchiṣṭaṃ phalam anindyaṃ / In any case, the idea seems to be older than the canonical formation of Brāhmaṇical identity after the time of Aśoka. 726Bṛhaspatismṛti 1.13.33–37: hiraṇya-kupya-sūtrāṇāṃ kāṣṭha-pāṣāṇa-carmaṇām / saṃskartā tu kalābhijñaḥ śilpī prokto manīṣibhiḥ // hemakārādayo yatra śilpaṃ saṃbhūya kurvate / karmānurūpaṃ nirveśa labheraṃs te yathā ‘ṃśataḥ // śikṣakābhijñakuśalā ācāryāś ce’ti śilpinaḥ / ekadvitricaturbhāgān labheyus te yathottaram // harmyaṃ devagṛhaṃ vā ’pi dhārmikopaskarāṇi ca / saṃbhūya kurvatāṃ caiṣāṃ pramukho dvyaṃśam arhati // nartakānām eṣa eva dharmaḥ sadbhir udāhṛtaḥ / tālajño labhate ‘dhyardhaṃ/ gāyanās tu samāṃśinaḥ // 
751 
Writing in the seventh century, the Bṛhaspatismṛti is composed in a world where, as 
we have seen, both the Pramāṇa scriptures of the Lākulas and their relationship with their 
disciples would already have been an established feature of the discursive landscape. It is 
difficult to tell who is influencing whom, but in any case, here Brāhmaṇical Dharmaśāstra 
specifically introduces an internal social division within artisan communities that the earlier 
texts merely implied, wherein śilpins and kārukas, however we might construe the changing 
connection between those two lexemes, are understood as the disciples of special classes of 
teachers, called ācāryas. The professional responsibilities of these ācāryas include instructing 
their disciples, overseeing the production process, and providing juridical oversight and 
censure according to guild rules as needed. In other words, the duties outlined for the ācārya 
of the śilpin correspond precisely with those of the sthānācārya or pratiṣṭhāpanācārya, a title 
that in the inscriptional records of the early medieval Deccan is ubiquitously assigned to the 
leading Kālamukhācārya at any given ritual center, who is also deemed responsible for 
overseeing the professional lives of dancers, musicians, and gaṇikās. In short, precisely at the 
moment when, replacing the older Lākulas, the Kālamukhas begin to surface with some 
consistency in our documentary records, the traditions of Kāruka Śaivas, and perhaps also the 
Vaimalas, had effectively become a subordinate component within the Lākula tradition and the 
Lākula Siddhānta in turn had begun to merge with the Kālamukhasamaya. Succinctly, in much 
of the medieval Deccan, to be an artist or artisan was effectively to be an initiate in the 
Atimārga who lived under the direction of a skull-bearing ācārya. 
Indeed, this conceptual model of an ācārya—unmistakably modelled after the by then 
long-departed Kālamukhas—and the artisan disciple, as two subdivisions of yogic practitioners 
linked as much by a logic of initiation into Śākta praxis as by social ties, has played a persistent 
752 
part in the social imaginary of the Deccan down into recent times. While the subject is so rich 
as to warrant its own long monograph, for our purposes it is perhaps worthwhile to glimpse 
briefly some of the evidence from the early Marathi sources, which strongly supports the 
analysis of the rather dense and fragmentary early medieval Tantric texts we have just 
completed. An unpublished and untitled perhaps fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Marathi 
Śilpaśāstra,727 for example, begins by first introducing us to the path of jñāna (jñānāmārgācā) 
marked by the rising of the kuṇḍalinī. It then speaks of the ācāryas who carry the pañcabrahma 
mantras and showed (dekhile) the essence of reality (tattvasāra) taught in the Āgamas. We 
learn that these five acāryās (pañcācāryas)—a category already found in the Lākula scriptures 
as well as the Niśvāsa, teach the Śilpaśāstra and govern the five artisanal castes (pañcāḷa). 
Unmistakably, the kuladevatā of these artisans is at once Kāḷikā and Vāgeśvarī. 
We bow to the Goddess of speech in the form of Mother Kāḷikā! [O goddess,] you are the clan deity of the Pāñcālas! Whichever one is crafting things following the Śilpaśāstra is for the [benefit] of the three worlds. The far end/farthest shore of this cave/profound thing that is Śilpaśāstra is not known to the Veda.728 
After venerating their goddess, who is remarkably similar to the type of deity whose 
image we saw at Shirshangi as well as the focus of artisan worship in the Aparājitapṛcchā, the 
“fivefold” gurus of the five artisan castes, and the pañcabrahma mantras, which form the core 
of its own mantra system, the Śilpaśāstra continues by in fact using a strikingly similar 
doxographical strategy to one found in the opening of the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā. Whereas in that 
source, Śiva’s subordinate Ananta and not Śiva himself is said to release the four Vedas, 
making them a de facto inferior revelation, our Marathi Śilpa text envisions the five-headed 
Viśvakarman—whose iconography is derived from Svacchanda Bhairava—emitting from his 
727Here I cite from a manuscript in the private collection of the late Ramachandra Chintamani Dhere. 728Śilpaśāstra, fol. 2: namana karū vāgeśvarī kāḷikemāte, tuco pāñcāḷāciye kuladevate, jeka kavana [emd. je kākayana] karī śilpaśāstrāte, karāvayā trilokālāgī / śilpaśāstrāce gihavara vedā na kaleci par // 
753 
secret fifth head the superior stream of gnostic wisdom. Included within this transmission, we 
are told, is the artisan dharma that transmits the teachings on gold work, śilpa, bronze casting, 
and so forth. Once Viśvakarman’s secret fifth head has finished its work, he emits the four 
Vedas from his subordinate four heads.729 For this reason, we learn, the Viśvakarmans, in 
whose ranks śilpins are included, are therefore better understood as “Pañcālā 
Viśvabrāhmaṇas.” Worshipping the supreme maker in both his iconic form and as alakṣya 
nirañjana jyoti, this fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Marathi work understands this 
community—assigned just as in the Lākula sources to the ṛṣikula—to be the sole observers of 
a special śivācāra. They call this conduct of conduct the sīvadharmu—indeed, it is closely 
derived from the Śivadharmaśāstra—and they say that is ontologically a priori to 
varṇāśramadharma. As such, the status of artisans is said to exceed that of mere 
varṇāśramadharma observing twice-borns.730 
Turning back briefly to medieval Karnataka, we have seen in earlier chapters that the 
old Kannada inscriptions—for example, at the great artisan training center at Shirshangi— 
often speak of the paññavañnige or pañcavaññige. In inscriptions found at major Kālamukha 
ritual centers, along similar lines, an underdetermined institution called the Pañcamaṭha 
surfaces with some frequency. This is often assumed to be referring to five specific maṭhas, 
729In quite a similar spirit, after the theological exploration of the pervasive nature of the haṃsa mantra we have already encountered, the Śrīkaṇṭhīya itself opens by explaining that unlike the śuddhavidyā of Śaiva, Tantric, and Kaula knowledge, which are emitted from the five heads of Parameśvara himself, the four Vedas, corresponding to the gross elements, emerged from the mouth of the demiurge Ananta (anantamukhaniryātam āgamoditavartmanā), and thus amount to a lower order of authority. 730A representative sample of this discourse, which contains a number of irregular forms, runs as follows. Śilpaśāstra, folio 9: teci advaita alakṣanirañjana / nāhī varnābhinnābhinna / te āpe āpajāṇa // svarūpatayāce // esiyā parabrahmāci stutī / teci pāñcāḷapañcabrahma bolatī / śiva ācāremirevatī / mukhamāsī pāñcāḷate // jo daivajña sonārū / to sukṣmavedācā guru / jayācā ase jñānapantha thorū / tayā brāḥmaṇācā / pāṅcamukhe parameśvarāsī / tethe janmapāñcāḷāsi / kuḷagurute caturānanāsī / ādigurusarvāce / yera brāhmaṇa ṛṣīkuḷā / te kalayugī brāhmaṇakevaḷa / je hote śūddhanirmaḷa / tayāghāloni māge puḍhe jāle āpaṇa / je ādibrāhmaṇa hotetarāhile // 
754 
sometimes said to be based at the Kālamukha ritual center of the Śaktipariṣad at Balligave in 
Shimoga district. As we saw in the last chapter, an examination of the neighborhood 
surrounding one of these supposed monastic centers, the famous Koḍīyamaṭha, now commonly 
called “pañcamaṭha,” suggests another possibility. The extended grounds of this rather humble 
structure house the supposed birthplace of the Vīraśaiva śaraṇa Allamaprabhu, who the local 
people, now mostly Pañcācārya Vīraśaivas born in artisan castes, insist was born in Balligave 
and belonged to the goldsmith caste. In a similar spirit, regarding the modern Kannadiga 
tradition of Sanskritic Vīraśaivas, while the tradition of the Pañcācāryas is now organized 
around a theology of five hypothetical ācāryas whose seats are occupied by human teachers,731 
an exploration of their key sacred seat of Ujjayini in central Karnataka reveals that their maṭha 
housing a Cāḷukya period temple is embedded once again in residential neighborhoods housing 
artisans, especially goldsmiths. Perhaps not accidentally, the communities maintain several 
shrines to the goddess Kālikā at Shirshangi, whom they worship alongside the living gurus, 
and indeed images associated with this goddess are actually preserved on the Cāḷukya period 
lintels. Instead of being comprised of five specific institutional sites, I propose that the 
medieval pañcamaṭha system refers to the governing monastic authorities, originally 
Kālamukhas, responsible for the oversight of the five-fold artisan castes, including the śilpins. 
This system in turn seems to descend in some fashion from the mention of the Pañcācāryas 
and Pañcapīṭha found in the Lākula cosmologies. It is these offices and institutions that were 
inherited by the later Vīraśāiva pontiffs. 
731On the Pañcācāryas and other iterations of the “Sanskritic” Vīraśaiva traditions, see the work of Elaine Fisher, especially Elaine Fisher, “A Microhistory of a South Indian Monastery: The Hooli Brḥanmatḥa and History of Sanskritic Vīraśaivism,” Journal of South Asian Intellectual History 1, no. 1 (2019): 1–35, and “The Tangled roots of Vīraśaivism: On the Vīrmāheśvara Textual culture of Srisailam. History of Religions 59, no. 1 (2019): 1–37. 
755 
Having established that the general contours of a Kāruka discourse and some sense of 
its relation to the worldview of the Lākulas is eminently recoverable and that if one attends to 
a range of prescriptive and doxographical sources, the canon in question corresponds to the 
various divisions of the Pārameśvara corpus as well as the Śākta texts on Pratiṣṭhā, we are now 
ready to turn the majority of our attention for the remainder of this chapter to the largest, most 
influential, and best preserved representative of this discourse: the Piṅgalāmata. Remembered 
by the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā as the most recent form of pratiṣṭhā revelation, the Piṅgalāmata 
offers us an unparalleled window into the life-world of the Śākta śilpins of the Deccan. 
Unsurprisingly, for it is product of all the various scriptural and social currents we have just 
been exploring, prefiguring the language of the later devotional sources, the Piṅgalāmata 
speaks of an identical social arrangement wherein the domain of śilpa is subdivided between 
the offices of artisan and guru: 
Liṅgas are said to be divided twofold: moving and non-moving. As for which one gives mokṣa and which one gives enjoyment in the world, listen according to the way it is in the Āgama taught by Śiva. 
The moving liṅga is called the ācārya. He is the agent of protecting the svadharma of the Śaivas. He acts for his own benefit, or he may enact siddhi for someone else’s benefit, or protects someone else’s dharma. . . . 
And I will say the definition of those two that consist of the pramāṇa and unmāna in which. . . those two, being obtained, bestow bhoga and mokṣa. . . . 
The ācārya who maintains the Śiva observance should not be too tall or too short. According to the Pramāṇa, he should not have a missing limb, and he should not have extra parts. . . . As for the best one, his mind does not err. . . and his skin is light. 
He is endowed with definition (lakṣaṇa) and the thing to be defined (lakṣya). He is the knower to the adhvāna732 [sic] and the procedure for installation (pratiṣṭhā). He knows the procedure concerning vidyāvāstu. He knows the procedure for the thread for 
732The term adhvan refers to the hierarchy of planar realms through which the Atimārga adept and his Śaiva Siddhānta successor ascends in his practice. All the manuscripts here, however, attest the irregular reading “adhvāna,” which seems to be original to our source. 
756 
measuring the liṅga. Such a person is practiced in astrology and he is always devoted to the practice of yoga.733 
As we can see the, the text envisions the ācārya himself at once as a sacerdotal 
authority—in fact as a flesh and blood substitute for a fixed liṅga—and as a juridical agent. It 
is in this later capacity that the ācārya protects and enforces the svadharma of the Śaivas. 
Much as we saw in the Mataṅga, the Piṅgalāmata repeatedly demonstrates that its intended 
referent is none other than the base-line framework provided by the Śivadharmaśāstra, which 
is then complemented by the select samaya rules related to specific Śākta initiatory statuses. 
As even this small selection begins to indicate, the type of erudition required for holding the 
office of ācārya synthesizes what we think of as the quintessential dimensions of any Tantric 
knowledge system—mantra, mudrā, homa, and the manipulation of specific cosmological 
frameworks in a ritual setting towards both mundane and soteriological ends—with the 
technical skill and encrypted guild knowledge necessary for the design and execution of ritual 
implements, images crafted in a range of media, the construction of temples, as well as more 
pervasive approaches to medieval urban planning. Though we may be inclined to draw 
distinctions between the utilitarian and esoteric or the secular and the sacred, from the 
perspective of the texts themselves, the “secret conventions” for measuring and making a 
supportive balustrade are just as much an expression of the “esoteric knowledge” found in the 
Tantras as is the ability to achieve and sustain the āveśa of the deity. Much as we saw in chapter 
4, the role played by the ācārya in guiding the artisans in their acquisition of skill and 
733Piṅgalāmata, chapter 2: talliṅgaṃ dvividhaṃ proktaṃ calācalaṃ vimokṣadam / bhogadaṃ yad bhavel loke śivenāgamataḥ śṛṇu // calam ācāryaḥ śaivas tu svadharmapratipālakaḥ / svārthasiddhyai parārthasādhakaṃ pālano ’pi vā / lakṣaṇan tu tayor brūmi pramāṇonmānarūpakam // yasmin yadvarṇajau prāptau bhogadau mokṣadau tathā /. . . . śivavratadharācāryo nātidīrghātihrasvakaḥ // pramāṇena na hīnāṅgo na cāpi adhikāṃśakaḥ / saṃpūrṇāvayavair divyair vikṣipto na śaṭhaḥ kvacit. . . . na manobhrānta vai citto rūpaṃ vai gauram uttamam / lakṣyalakṣaṇasaṃyuktaḥ pratiṣṭhādhvānavedakaḥ // vidyāvāstuvidhānajño liṅgasūtravidhānavit / jyotiṣe ca kṛtābhyāsaḥ yogābhyāsarataḥ sadā // 
757knowledge can thus be understood as entailing a form of professionalization, where the body 
of knowledge to be mastered happens to be derived from Śākta and Śaiva Tantras. In contrast, 
here is how the Piṅgalāmata delineates the role of the regular śilpin: 
Or, it could be the case that the sādhaka is the common type, possibly a householder, Listen! 
The householder, through union with the housewife, has the conduct of yoga and knows the procedure. He is a striver. He is endowed with sattva. He knows the śilpa. He is skilled in intellect. That one is the best in all tasks and in particular in regard to the portion [of scripture] pertaining to mantra. He is devoted to the devotees of Śiva. He is approved by the guru. He is the king of śilpins. 
He is not one-eyed. He is not deaf. He is not blind. He does not have a deformed ear. He is not someone with club foot. He does not have severed nose, feet, or fingers. He does not have extra limbs. He is not cruel. He does not have a deficient or excessive body; he eats sparingly and restrains his senses. He would be familiar with the definitions. He is mad for standard and measure. He is insightful with regard to the injunctions of the Vastusūtra. He has steady hands and sees straight. 
At the time of death, the śilpin accomplishes the exhaustion of all prārabdha karma, with his life breaths all [going forth] from his throat. The artisans become gods or friends of the gods and they become powerful. All of them are intent on devotion to Rudra. They are endowed with sāhasa.734 They are intent on dharma regarding the thing that is obtained by means the self, 735 which has the state of all. . . .736 
734Compare this passage with Brahmayāmala 197b, which describes the adept who observes and completes his vows. samayajño [k: -jñā] yogibhaktaś ca udyuktāḥ sāhasānvitaḥ nilaṃjjoti ghṛṇaṃ caiva gurubhakto jitendriyaḥ // 171 // 735This line is terribly corrupt. Several emendations are possible. One might also read this is as a dictum, taking the emended reading ātmanā sarvabhāvena parārthe dharmatatparāḥ, “one who is intent on dharma oneself makes all kinds of endeavors for the sake others.” One might also read this in the spirit of Śivadharmaśāstra 1.40: yo māṃ sarvagataṃ paśyet sarvaṃ ca mayi saṃsthitam / tasyāhan nityamātmasthaḥ sa ca nityammayi sthitaḥ // Another possibility, given the extended use of the instrumental in Aiśa, is to take the reading ātmaiva sarvabhāvena prāptārthe dharmatatparāḥ, “the purpose of dharma is the self alone, which is to be obtained by all beings.” 736The exact meaning of the line that follows is again a matter of conjecture and depends on emendation: ataḥ kartuḥ pravakṣyāmi yathā vai brāhmaṇāditaḥ / aśrātaḥ [var. aśrāntaḥ, aśrayāntaḥ] śaktisampannaḥ śivaikāgatamānasaḥ // A:aśrayāntaḥ. Should we take the reading of the Nepalese Devanāgarī transcript preserved in the NGMP (emended to āśrayāntaḥ), one might interpret that the passage is about the agent—in other words, the pratiṣṭhācārya: “Next, I will tell about the agent, just as with Brāhmaṇas and so forth. At the ending of taking refuge, they take the initiatory name in Śakti, their minds solely focused on Śiva.” On the other hand, if we do not accept this reading, the passage is about the authority of the agent over the artisans: ataḥ kartuḥ pravakṣyāmi yathā vai brāhmaṇāditaḥ / aśrāntaḥ śaktisampannaḥ śivaikāgatamānasaḥ // “I shall now speak about the śilpins from the perspective of their commanding agent, not resorting to Brāhmaṇas and so forth, with minds focused solely on Śiva, they are endowed with Śakti.” 
758 
The person whose livelihood is done for the sake of dharma should commence the purposeful action (arthakriyā) [that is sculpting and so forth]. It is a nitya duty from which the state of mokṣa follows.737 
As this passage makes plain, just as we found explicitly delineated in the Dharmaśāstra 
and hinted at in the Tantric doxographies, the Piṅgalāmata envisions two different types of 
people—ācāryas and śilpins—as involved in the design of buildings and the production of 
images. While, as we have seen, this bifurcation was normative for much of Indian history, in 
conceptualizing these roles our text is also specifically drawing upon a range of older Tantric 
sources. Quite specifically, the Piṅgalāmata inherits a tradition already evident in the seventh- 
century Picumata Brahmayāmala, from which, given its placement in the stream of the Vāma, 
our text in part descends. The unedited voluminous fourth chapter738 of that text begins by 
telling us it will teach the work of image-making according to injunction (pratimākarma 
yathāvidhi). The primary form of this practice is directed towards the production of complex 
images of multi-armed and multi-headed Bhairavas, Bhairavīs, and their retinues situated on 
lotuses that strongly resemble the materials we have already explored in Aparājitapṛcchā 
where they are treated as integral to artisan pūjā. Here, a figure called a mantrin—at once a 
power-seeking professional ascetic and pratiṣṭhācārya—is deemed solely responsible for the 
crafting of images and construction of structures. 
737Piṅgalāmata: sadhako vā samānaḥ syād gṛhastha iti vā śṛṇu / gṛhastho gṛhiṇīyogāt yogaśīlo vidhānavit // udyamī satvasampannaḥ śilpajño buddhikauśalaḥ / śreṣṭho ’sau sarvakāryeṣu mantrāṃśe ca viśeṣataḥ // śivabhaktānuraktaś ca gurusammataḥ śilpirāṭ / na kāṇo badhir andhaś ca coṭakarṇo ’tha ślīpadī // achinnanāsāṃgulipādo ‘krūro nyūnādhikāṃgakaḥ / na hīnapūrṇakāyas tu sitabhuk saṃyatendriyaḥ // so ’pi syāl lakṣaṇābhijñaḥ pramāṇonmānamāditaḥ / vāstusūtravidhau prājñaḥ sthirahasto ṛjurdṛśaḥ / prārabdhakarmaniṣpattiṃ prāṇaiḥ kaṇṭhagatair api / kurute śilpinaḥ śūrāḥ sahāyāḥ pauruṣānvitāḥ // rudrabhaktiparāḥ sarve sāhasānvitasattvikāḥ / ātmaiva sarvabhāvena prāptārthe dharmatatparāḥ /. . . . dharmārthajīvitaṃ yasya tasyārthakriyam ārabhet / karttavyeti kriyā nityaṃ yato mokṣapadānugam // 738The summary here is based on Mark Dyczkowski’s preliminary edition of the text, which collates several manuscripts and offers some emendations. This was previously shared with the public on Muktabodha. In light of the painstaking critical work being done on the Brahmayāmala, all of these observations are preliminary and thoroughly subject to the presentation of an improved version of the text. 
759 
In the Picumata, under the general category of the work of image-making 
(pratimākarma), mantrin-related handcrafts incorporate such tasks as the crafting of the 
ḍamaru that is borne by the observer of the Kāpalika vow, his special skull bowl, called a turā, 
his khaṭvāṅga, as well as the delineation of measurements and iconography associated with 
crafting both three dimensional and painted images in a range of mediums. However, in the 
Picumata Brahmayāmala, especially in its subdivision on pratiṣṭhā, the fashioning of such 
images and “the founding of temples”—if we can even call them that—dedicated to the 
worship of its pantheon is essentially a clandestine affair. Indeed, addressed to the deity 
Kapālīśa, whom the Picumata inherits from earlier sources, the whole ritual sequence that 
forms of the center of the chapter—conducted inside of the brahmasthāna in the center of the 
sacred space where the deity is to be installed, and involving worshipping things invoked into 
skull bowls as well as pots of liquor, often using the nectar of the left (vāmamṛta)—seems 
rather archaic and offers many terminological and schematic parallels with older 
systematicities in our Tantric doxographies. While, as Shaman Hatley has recently 
demonstrated with great clarity, the social imaginary of the Brahmayāmala not only 
incorporates but positively welcomes the inclusion of both householders and women, it does 
not seem to imagine the role of the householder as in any way associated with pratimākarma 
itself.739 Given that so much of the corpus of texts on śilpa is no longer available to us, it is 
impossible to determine if in reimagining the role of the artisan as primarily fulfilled by a 
householder, the Piṅgalāmata is itself innovating. It is, however, certain that our text is deeply 
invested in this conception of that social role. 
739See Shaman Hatley, “Sisters and Consorts: Representations of Women in the Brahmayāmala,” in Tantric Communities in Context, ed. Nina Mirnig, Marion Rastelli, and Vincent Eltschinger (Vienna: Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 2019), 49–82. 
760 
Essentially, however, the Piṅgalāmata imagines the ideal social actor—the one who is 
“king” or best of the śilpins—as a married, indeed sexually active, householder. Invoking the 
language of the Śivadharma, the śilpin is a rudrabhakta, devoted both to Śiva and his bhaktas, 
who acts at all times under the direction of a Śaiva guru. At the same time, just like the Cāḷukya 
kings and their local counterparts among the nāyakas, the artisan is also a sāhāsika. In other 
words, the śilpin is an initiate into the Śākta-Śaiva rituals with their transgressive socialities 
that emend the general rules of the Śivadharma with specific supersessionary samaya 
injunctions. 
As we have seen, these include the sort of practices we have already examined in 
chapter 3, starting with the communal consumption of the vīradravya as a mark of social 
commensality among initiates from different walks of life and perhaps extending up to 
consorting with yoginīs. As you may remember from the fourth chapter, when Someśvara III 
introduced the category of the artisans by characterizing them vis-à-vis their relationship with 
the king by stating rather baldly that “the king is never without the fifth caste,” the Cāḷukya 
ruler almost certainly intended to allude to precisely this shared commensality, which places 
artisans and rulers on a level playing field, at least with the confines of the circumscribed realm 
of ritual. Just as we found in our study of Tantric doxographies, where the Kārukas, placed at 
the level of the genitals, are associated with Vāmadeva on the one hand and the Vāma Tantras 
on the other, within the Picumata Brahmayāmala itself, these practices are defined as the Vāma 
path. Indeed, though the Piṅgalāmata itself does not explore this matter in any detail, if we 
take the text as faithfully expanding on certain aspects of the ritual system of the Picumata 
Brahmayāmala and its successor scriptures, when the text speaks of the householder as 
761 
“performing yoga” “through union with the house-wife,” it is quite plausible that it is invoking 
the older scripture’s conception of yoga as a “mahāyoga.” In much the same manner as in some 
of the early Vajrayāna sources, 740 mahāyoga—which may simply originate as a textual 
corruption for an original reading of mahāyāga, here apparently means a form of sexual 
practice in which the pantheon of the system is ritually invoked onto the moist vagina of a 
human ritual consort. Worship, involving intercourse, is then performed, culminating in the 
production and offering of sexual fluids. If this is indeed the intended meaning, what we may 
be seeing here is an early trace of a development more typically associated with post-Kaula 
vernacular sources, of the sort we will encounter in chapter 8, wherein the ideal consort of a 
householder rājayogin becomes his own wife. Just like the Kāruka, the śilpin it seems abides 
at the level of the genitals. 
Apart from its integration of basic Vāma-style pūjā into the domain of the household, 
in the Piṅgalāmata’s vision, the śilpin’s primarily religious duty is not the performance of 
specific tantric sādhanās nor the transmission of Śaiva gnosis; this again is why unlike the 
Lākula he is not defined by his access to gnosis and scriptural knowledge. Instead, for the 
Śilpin, sādhana is comprised of the successful execution of his quotidian duties as builder, 
painter, sculptor, and so forth. If he successfully completes these tasks, or, as the Niśvāsa had 
said, “keeps his observances until death,” we are told, when he expires, the śilpin experiences 
the same kind of death as the most accomplished of yogins. Instead of having his prāṇas 
descend out of his body and become scattered, resulting in transmigration, his vital breaths will 
exit through his head. This ensures first, a period of enjoyment of his merit in a heavenly realm, 
740Sam van Schaik, for example, has located such an understanding within the ninth- through eleventh-century manuscripts preserved at Dunhuang: “The Summary defines Mahāyoga union as the ‘the union of the vajra and the lotus.’ This is of course a symbolic reference to the male and female sexual organs.” Sam van Schaik, “A Definition of Mahāyoga: Sources from Dunhuang,” Tantric Studies 1 (2008): 64. 
762 
just like any other sādhaka, and then, once the storehouse of positive merits is exhausted, a 
final and lasting liberation. As our text clarifies elsewhere, unlike an ācārya or putraka, the 
śilpin is initiated only into a third of the system of knowledge transmitted within the 
Piṅgalāmata and the Śākta Tantric systems to which it is related. Rather significantly, the 
portion of the tradition that is transmitted is inclusive of the mantra system in its entirety. 
In other words, for him it is not caryā, but kriyā that predominates (kriyāpradhāna). 
The capacities that are imbued into him by his guru through initiation into the Śākta Tantras 
are key to fulfilling his obligatory ritual duties, which will ensure his own liberation. As the 
passages we have read have shown, however, success in such endeavors is only possible when 
esoteric attainments are married to quotidian practical skills and technical expertise. In other 
words, just like an ācārya, even if he is a siddha, has to manage the monastic bureaucracies, 
train and pay his workers, accept deposits in the treasury, and provide ritual services to kings 
and other notables if they request them, a śilpin has to be both a sattvic being capable of 
embodying ecstatic bhāvas, while having steady hands to hold his tools and the ability to see 
straight. As for what sort of things a śilpin might see, that is the subject of our next section. 
And That is Why He Created It This Way: Nondualism and the Culture of Material 
Images on the Path of Bhairava 
Towards the end of the Mānasollāsa’s discussion of the iṣṭāpūrta—the canon of sacrifices and 
philanthropic projects as integral to the office of kingship as they are to being twice-born or 
serving as a patron—in addressing the future sovereigns and those who serve in their cabinets 
that make up his intended readers, the Cāḷukya King Someśvara III instructs: 
The king, out of devotion, should commission (kārayet) temples for deities as well as monasteries. This is to be accomplished following the doctrine of Viśvakarman, in accordance with the Mayaśāstra, following procedures related in the Matsya[purāṇa] and in accordance with the standards in the Piṅgalāmata. By means of the proven 
763 
authorities, he should establish the four human aims. The wise [king] should commission images founded upon the procedure that follows the authoritative measures pertaining to proportionality (navatāla). The images should be complete, with all their limbs. They should be pleasing to the eyes, and somewhat plump. They are to be endowed with the proper weapons and accoutrements as stated in the authoritative texts.741 
In the other contexts where he presents lists of relevant authorities or a catalog of sacred 
places—as is often the case within the śāstras—Someśvara III’s explicit intention is to 
introduce a scale of texts organized in terms of their relevant significance. There is little reason 
to suspect the current passage of diverging from this rhetorical model.742 At the top of this 
hierarchy of authorities, we find the Piṅgalāmata itself. 
741Mānasollāsa: viśvakarmamatenāpi mayaśāstrānusārataḥ / matsyaproktavidhānena piṅgalāmatamānataḥ // kalitena pramāṇena puruṣārthacatuṣṭayaṃ / kārayed devatāgāraṃ maṭhān bhaktyā mahīpatiḥ // navatālapramāṇena vidhānena samanvitāḥ / pratimāḥ kārayet pūrvam uditena vicakṣaṇaḥ // sarvāvayavasaṃpūrṇāḥ kiñcitpīnā dṛśoḥ priyāḥ / yathoktair āyudhair yuktā bahubhiś ca yathoditaiḥ // 742 The canon of authorities he offers is somewhat curious. The first, labelled the Viśvakarmaśāstra, which shows textual parallels to the Aparājitapṛcchā in several places, is also cited by Hemādri in the opening division of his mid-thirteenth-century Caturvargacintāmaṇi, Though it bears the same title as a published work, this seems to represent a lost or at least unpublished authority. The case of the Mayaśāstra is similarly deceptive. After the Mānasāra, the so called Mayamata is today perhaps the most famous and frequently consulted work of Vāstuśāstra, both by practitioners and art historians. This is unfortunate, for, as Bruno Dagens has observed in passing, both texts are clearly the products of a post-thirteenth-century religious and intellectual milieu, with the latter work almost certainly being composed in the Tamil country concurrently with Tamil Nadu specific recreations of the Śaivāgamas exclusively dedicated to ritual surrounding the construction and functioning of temples. By the Mayaśāstra, Someśvara III almost certainly in fact intends to invoke an unpublished work called the Mayasūtrasaṃgraha. This survives in a fragmentary fashion in at least three Nepalese manuscripts and is also the subject of an important unpublished commentary: the Bhāvacūḍāmaṇi, a copy of which is in my possession. Composed in the eleventh century in Kashmir by Vidyākaṇṭha II, a preceptor in the same preceptorial lineage of dualistic Śaiva Siddhānta as Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha II, the Bhāvacūḍāmaṇi appears to offer an act of intellectual appropriation by the normative Siddhānta of a textual resource that the author makes quite apparent originates in different religious milieu. The text itself represents this domain as one revealed by the lord Śrīkaṇṭha, the same figure who reveals the liminal Mataṅgapārameśvara, to the paramamāheśvaras, who are singularly intent on the grace granted for the bhaktas, and whose minds are solely focused on Śiva. In short, like the Mataṅga itself, this text emerges from a realm that is decidedly closer to an older stratum of Atimārga affiliated Śākta inflected sources than the works with which the commentator identifies. Indeed, in making sense of the Mayasūtrasaṃgraha itself, one of Vidyākaṇṭha II’s most essential resource proves to be none other than the Piṅgalāmata, from which he cites at least a dozen times. In the case of the Matsya Purāṇa, in contrast, its significance is quite transparent. From the time of its composition, a date which, though contested, likely significantly predates these other sources, its eighteen chapters have formed one of the core points of common reference, operating across theological divides, for envisioning and constructing the Indian temple. Though in its current form it privileges a Vaiṣṇava pantheon, the Matsya Purāṇa itself offers a frame story with apparent links to the Bhairava Siddhānta. 
764 
In her seminal work The Hindu Temple, Stella Kramrisch refers to the Piṅgalāmata 
twice, in both cases invoking its definition of the aṅgula. As she tells us on the first occasion, 
“According to the ‘Piṅgalāmata’, however. . . . aṅgula is the breadth measurement of the upper 
phalange of one’s own thumb.”743 In short, Kramrisch approaches the work as a source for a 
particular form of otherwise unavailable specialized technical knowledge as opposed to a 
document with a particular social and theological vision. That Kramrisch is aware of the work 
in any capacity is due to a peculiar set of circumstances. After he inquired about what sort of 
traditional resources might be available for studying the precolonial self-understandings of 
Indian craftsmen, the Bengali poet and winner of the Nobel Prize in literature Rabindranath 
Tagore was given a gift of two manuscripts by the king of Nepal with the intention that they 
would be housed at the library at Shantiniketan and eventually taken up for study. 
As it so happens, the texts in question proved to be selections from the Picumata 
Brahmayāmala and chapter 4 of the Piṅgalāmata. Tagore entrusted these to the great 
Sinologist and Sanskritist Prabodha Chandra Bagchi, who, just before his untimely death, 
produced a small article analyzing its chapter on iconography as well as a posthumously 
published translation. Bagchi’s project was subsequently taken up by S. N. Ghosal Sastri, who 
integrated it into a wider study of Indian handicrafts.744 Ironically, as we are about to see, 
though the chapters available at Shantiniketan were not sufficient to the task, Tagore’s 
prescient interest in recovering the self-understandings of Indic artisans would have found an 
ideal match in the other chapters of the Piṅgalāmata, which in fact provides us with probably 
743Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple Volume I (Calcutta: University of Calcutta, 1946), 134. 744While this chapter was being revised, the long-awaited release of Shaman Hatley’s study of select portions of the Brahmayāmala was found to contain many of these same observations about the reception history of the Brahmayāmlala and Piṅgalāmata at Shantiniketan, which had been arrived at independently. See Hatley, Brahmayāmalatantra or Picumata, 11–12. 
765 
the richest surviving sources for recovering the life-worlds of the sorts of people who produced 
what survives of the material culture of the Deccan. For while the other sources in the genre of 
the Śilpaśāstras seem mostly to be addressing the caste gurus of the artisans, the Piṅgalāmata 
is distinctive in the unprecedented interest it displays regarding the self-understanding of the 
artisans themselves. 
As was mentioned in passing in our exploration of its passages outlining samaya codes, 
the Piṅgalāmata is composed in a highly irregular register of Sanskrit. Depending on your 
predilections, it is either abounding in grammatical and syntactical abominations or offering a 
taste of the pure vernacular. Regardless, this is a mode of textuality clearly produced by people 
who do not emerge from the same interpretive communities that are responsible for most of 
Sanskrit literature and scholarship. For this reason alone, if our aim is to understand the 
multiplicity of emic perspectives that the medieval world accommodated, the Piṅgalāmata is 
invaluable. Perhaps because it offers an outsider’s attempt at adopting much of the idiom of 
the śāstras, our Pratiṣṭhā Tantra approaches questions of the interrelationship between the 
stylistic features native to systematic forms of thought in South Asia and the intention and 
message a work aims at conveying from a fresh and unusually self-reflexive perspective. One 
of the most spectacular passages in this vein is found towards the very end of the text, right 
before the sections on prāyaścitta and the pavitrārohana. We have just spent several hundred 
pages painstakingly taxonomizing different types of images, buildings, and liṅgas, according 
to the materials used to produce them as well as their functions. In other words, a śāstra 
dedicated to pratiṣṭhā and its various features has been written in the typical manner of a śāstra. 
It offered us definitions delineating the defining features of the endless speciation of types and 
sub-types. 
766 
There is nothing so unusual about any of this—whether we are talking logical fallacies, 
types of gems, or archetypes of women. This is just what śāstras do in sorting knowledge: they 
create hierarchies and sort things out accordingly. It is thus rather amazing that, once it has 
offered all of its categorized systematicities, the Piṅgalāmata pauses and at some length 
reflects on the intellectual incongruity inherent in marrying the classification of the universe 
with a non-dualist or pantheist theology in which God is in everything and all pervasive. 
The goddess Piṅgalā asks: 
The śivaliṅga is not joined with the principles of lowest, middle, and highest, for, if it were related [to such notions], then there would be a fault, as in the case of any human constructed thing. Pervasion is known to be one with the pervader: this was previously stated by you. 
Because it has the power to produce results—you could say it is threefold—or thousand-fold, but [if you do], there is a great fault, because it is always of one sort, unwavering. 
How can Śiva who is one be twofold as the peaceful and the ferocious? Please tell all that in some detail, by your grace!745 
In setting out to reconcile its values with a typical Purāṇic rhetoric that ranks the 
relative value and sacredness of sites of worship, such that performing pūjā at one place is the 
same as performing eight horse sacrifices while at another its only worth one, our text asks 
some very basic questions which are otherwise utterly absent from the discourse. If Śiva is in 
everything, how can we grade his iconic and aniconic manifestations? If the Śiva nature is 
everywhere the same, on what basis can we speak about different types of liṅgas that are not 
only superior or inferior, but are energetically distinctive in such a manner that they are suited 
for different types of worship. Perhaps most fundamentally, the Piṅgalāmata inquires, if Śiva 
745Piṅgalāmata: adhamadhyottamaṃ ca śivaliṅgaṃ na yujyate / yujyate tadā doṣo yathā pauruṣavad bhavet // vyāptir vyāpakabhāvasya saikā proktā tvayā purā / siddhisādhanasaṃyogāt tridhā vā śatadhāpi vā // tatrāpi sumahān doṣaḥ caikarūpācalā sadā / na yuktaṃ saumyaraudraṃ ca śivaś caiko dvidhā kathaṃ / etat sarvaṃ samāsena kathayasva prasādataḥ // 
767is one, how can he be both peaceful and ferocious? In other words, where should we place 
Bhairava? To this inquiry, Bhairava replies: 
As for this being higher, middle, and lower, that is just the result of intentionality [on the part of the ritual agent]. It [the pervading power of the Lord] does not disappear as the result of one measurement of hand more or less; it comes in accordance with the will of the agent. . . . 
Even though they are set down with the same fruit in view, in the discourse of the world, [if they proclaim] they are for the purpose that is grounded in the common dharma, there is said to be “difference” according to the expenditure of wealth by the founder, or in accordance with the differing size of the main sanctum, and so on and so forth—we can still say that there is difference. . . . As we have said above, there are three siddhis and they are determined by the desire of the sādhaka [or] of Śiva.746 
Here Bhairava sets out to reconcile two different dimensions of this system: its theology 
and its pragmatics. On the one hand, if it were the case that when an artisan screws up or the 
project runs over budget and the proportions of building or deity had to be reduced in scale, 
the power of the pervasive deity were actually to be diminished, well, then he would not be 
much of a deity at all. The same would be true if the relative power of an image or structure 
were mechanistically the product of adhering to certain systems of proportionality. Bhairava’s 
solution is to propose that different scholastic conventions labelling buildings, liṅgas, and 
images as higher, middle, and lower correspond to different intentionalities on the part of the 
sponsoring patron as well as the craftsmen carrying out his vision. While God is everywhere 
and in all things, within the transactional realm that governs the lives of worldly people, things 
like how much money a project costs and how big and fancy a garbhagṛha you can afford 
really do make a difference and doing the right job—and hiring the right crew and project 
managers—can palpably affect the results you will get. Nevertheless, it is still Śiva himself 
746Piṅgalāmata: adhamadhyottamatavaṃ ca kiṃ na syāt sa vivakṣayā / na yāti karamānād vā yāti kartu vivakṣayā. . . . same phale ‘pi vinyāso lokamārgavivakṣayā / dharmasāmānyabodhārtham anyathā vā yathāyathaṃ / prāsādamānato vātha kartur dravyānusārataḥ / karamānādhamādyās tu tena bhedo ’sya kīrtitaḥ / yad uktaṃ ca tridhāsiddhiḥ sādhakecchā śivasya tu / 
768 
who is the causal agent that implements the distribution of the appropriate results to the 
worshippers. 
Having known the domain of them [where the desire is based], wherever he [the worshipper] is situated, He [Śiva] should give [as is appropriate to that domain]. . . . You cannot say [a liṅga] is [intrinsically] of lower quality because it gives siddhi of a lower kind of fruit, but can you then say that it is superior because it gives superior gifts? It is never deficient. 
A liṅga may be good for those who perform the requisite ritual actions. It is not vitiated simply in the faults of bad people that have faults. Just as, when a king gives fruits, and the wages depend on the work done, [under such circumstances] the king, on account of the greatness [or smallness] of shares [given], is not diminished even though he gives every kind of thing, in just the same way, the Lord of all things is not diminished on account of the measure of the small and medium things he distributes.747 
Waxing Shakespearean, Bhairava here argues that nothing is good or bad but thinking 
makes it so. It is the way individual human beings or other kinds of entities relate to the world 
that determines how the world and the objects it contains respond. Regardless of whether the 
results prove extravagant or meager, this is no reflection on the intrinsic value of the liṅga nor 
on the Lord of whom it is an expression. In just the same way that we do not say that a 
billionaire becomes a poor man when he leaves the waitress a five-dollar bill instead of a 
million dollars under his empty coffee cup, God granting quotidian favors to petty people does 
not make God petty. As we will see momentarily, Bhairava offers his intended audience this 
reflection on the working mechanics of transactional worship in the service of making a much 
more profound point about the interrelationship of the nature of universe and the vocation of 
craftsmen. 
Just like the nature of being a soul is one thing, even though, in the aggregate of the tattvas, it appears subdivided according to the divisions of states of being, just so is Śiva [differentiated] by the differences in form/the mūrti. Just as the sun with its rays 
747Piṅgalāmata: jñātvāśrayaṃ ca teṣāṃ hi yatra tatra sthito dadet. . . . na hīnaphalasiddhes tu hīnaṃ syād ucyate tu kim / uttamo ‘hīnadātṛtvān no hīna ucyate kvacit / sādhuḥ karmakarāṇāṃ ca dravyadoṣair na bādhyate // bhūpatir yathā dadyāt phalaṃ bhṛtyāś ca karmajāḥ / bhāgātiśayatas teṣāṃ sarvado ‘pi na hīyate / na hīyate tathā nāthaḥ pramāṇād adhamādināṃ / 
769 
may be in a particular place, so too the raudra quality is situated in the saumya images of Bhairava and others. It is intentionality (vivakṣitā) that is the universal accomplisher, it arises from the will of him [the agent]. 
Thus, for one who desires to perform raudrakarma, there would be a raudra form; for the one who desires to perform saumya rites, there is a saumya form. If you are one who is characterized as desiring liberation, then, provided your sins have ripened, you get an awareness of that (tanmatiḥ). Just as the variety of grace is to be understood to be achieved by śaktipāta, which is of various degrees of intensity, likewise, Śiva has a division of forms. 
In the same way that the attainment is manifest in the part of those who desire a particular fruit [in alignment with their intention], so it is with their focus of visualization (matiḥ). If you direct your operation of knowing with respect to the mode of omniscience, then one may become a lord of such a nature. “Let him be reborn in the world of beings with the same form!” 
The Lord does nothing more than cause to make manifest the action engaged in. If it were not like that, sādhanā would be pointless, and that is why he created it this way.748 
Here Bhairava offers what is essentially a phenomenological explanation of how we 
experience apparent difference in a world that in actuality is founded on ontological non- 
duality and then distills this theological message into a practical justification of the 
indispensable role of the craftsman. Just as the human soul, when mediated through the 
different ontic substrates that make up the many levels of existence, manifests different 
behaviors and propensities, in just the same way, when Śiva becomes evident, he necessarily 
takes on different forms that must be made manifest as distinctive mūrtis. God’s true nature, 
which is in fact that of the terrifying lord Bhairava, is all pervasive. Thus, it is equally present 
in all the sorts of common mundane images claimed by other traditions as it is in images that 
specifically represent “Bhairava.” Far from representing some specialized inferior register, 
748Piṅgalāmata: puṃbhāvaś ca yathā hy ekas tattvavrāte vibhāsate // bhinno bhāvādibhedena mūrtibhedāt tathā śivaḥ / viśeṣaḥ sthānagaḥ prokto yathārkaḥ kiraṇānvitaḥ // evaṃ raudraḥ sthitaḥ saumye bhairavādyākṛtau yathā / vivakṣā sādhakā sārvī tadicchāto ‘bhijāyate // raudrakarmepsuke raudraṃ saumyaṃ saumyepsuke bhavet / paripakvakaṣāyānāṃ mumukṣutve ca tanmatiḥ // śaktipātena mantavyas tīvratīvratarādinā / yathānugrahabhedas tu rūpabhedas tathā śivaḥ // yathā prāptir bhavati ca phalepsūnāṃ tathā matiḥ / jñātvā sarvajñatāvṛttau tadrūpī cābhavat prabhuḥ // astu loke sarūpāṇāṃ karmavyaktikaro hi saḥ / yadi no sādhanaṃ vyartham tenāsau tat tathā sṛjat // 
770 
“raudra” modalities and intentionalities, like the sun shining in the sky, directly express the 
supreme reality. Rather than God’s nature actually changing depending on how he is depicted, 
it is the intentionality of the agent, and the craftsman, that determines which aspects of god’s 
infinite plentitude become perceptible in a given vessel representing his glory. It is in the 
service of the aligning of intention with action for the benefit for the ritual actor, for example, 
that ferocious rituals demand a ferocious form of the deity. In other words, the nature of how 
God manifests before you is determined by the nature of your own consciousness. That 
consciousness, in turn, is conditioned by your preexisting balance of karmas and how they 
have been impacted by the types of initiations and ritual activities in which you have engaged. 
Succinctly, God takes on whatever qualities are present in the one who is seeking him out. Just 
as importantly, he manifests in the form that is appropriate to the intentionality of the seeker, 
and, once the seeker has successfully carried out the prescribed program of praxis, he ensures 
that appropriate result is conferred. Succinctly, the secret that Bhairava teaches his consort is 
not really terribly different from The Secret as promoted by Oprah Winfrey, albeit in lieu of an 
overly rosy vision obsessively focused on positive thinking, a good deal more rākṣasas and 
vetālas have been thrown into the fray. Or as Kauṇḍinya had put it, in pronouncing “Whatever 
you think, you become. This is the eternal secret,” the teachers of the Atimārga and their 
successors were as much offering their disciples a cautionary warning as they were aiming to 
impart motivation. 
Accordingly, Parameśvara takes the form of rākṣasas, piśācas, bhūtas, and vetālas along with pālakas and the gaṇas and vidyādharas and so forth. Because he is one whose nature is the supreme state and he pervades at all times [in all states of being], having assumed the nature of gods and yakṣas, he should convey the intended fruit. [Parameśvara is defined as] being omniscient, having his own will, having his own agency, as all compassionate. He is the lord, who is merciful and eternal. 
771 
And thus, he is the generator of fruits that come into existence in accordance with the [particular] way he exists for [different] Śiva souls. Thus, the liṅga has characteristics, just as the sādhaka has characteristics.749 
Implicit in this vision is that in reality, whenever an artisan sculpts an image, regardless 
of its iconography, he is really representing Bhairava. Though equally present in all things, 
Bhairava comes down into the world and takes on a myriad of shapes, behaving in that context 
in alignment with the forms he has assumed. People and other entities relate to him in 
accordance with their expectations, conditioned by the contents of their own minds. These in 
turn provoke certain types of reactions to the particular shape assumed which necessarily result 
in specific types of outcomes. Throughout all this play of mental elaborations and shapes, 
Bhairava’s power is imminent and at work at all times, operating as the causal engine that 
connects intention, actions, and results. From a scholarly perspective, animating this whole 
discourse are the fundamental epistemic assumptions we have encountered again and again 
throughout our medieval sources, namely, that immersion in a mimetic system of praxis 
irrevocably changes a person, that higher order metaphysical reflection or scholastic 
articulation has to be brought into accommodation with the quotidian transactional realities 
that govern lived experience, and that the world at every level is differentiated into different 
domains, each of which is governed by site- and agent-specific rules that are often 
incommensurable. 
If it is the tendency of our own academic discourse to view such conceptual 
theologizing abstractions as second order formulations reflecting the real dynamics that 
organize the actual social order, as we have by now seen repeatedly, the text instead directs us 
749Piṅgalāmata: evaṃ rakṣaḥ piśācānāṃ bhūtavetālapālakaḥ / gaṇavidyādharādīnāṃ rūpakaḥ parameśvaraḥ / yakṣadevātmako bhūtvā phalam iṣṭaṃ samāvahet / yato ’sau parabhāvaś ca vyāpakatvaṃ ca sarvadā / sarvajñatvaṃ svatantratvaṃ sarvakartṛtvalakṣaṇaṃ sarvakāruṇiko nātho dayālur nityaśāśvataḥ / ataś cāsau śivāṇūnāṃ bhāvād bhāvī phalasya ca / evaṃ saṃlakṣaṇaṃ liṅgaṃ sādhakas tu salakṣaṇaḥ // 
772 
to think in terms of a more complex dynamic of mutual imbrication. While worldly metaphors 
are used to illustrate divine architectonics, at the same time, the fundamental categories that 
form the building blocks of emic conceptualizations of the political and social are organized 
around subtle theological frames Western scholars of Indian religions and society are just 
beginning to understand. Indeed, as we can see, the passage concludes by turning its doctrinal 
conclusions upon the very categories and textual strategies that are productive of Indic 
knowledge itself, such that we arrive at last at what is essentially a just so story about where 
definitions (lakṣaṇa) come from and how the analytical model they presuppose can be rendered 
justifiable within a non-dualist framework. 
The sort of argumentation we have been just exploring can justifiably be read as an 
entextualization of the “folk understanding” of how “quotidian religion works,” retooled to 
suit the needs of the specific expectations of a community of artisans. In contrast, the 
Piṅgalāmata’s very first chapter demands to be read as a meditation on the relationship 
between knowledge and practice offered from the perspective of the Tantric-scholastic 
ritualists who serve at once as the gurus of the artisans and the sthānācāryas who govern and 
construct temple complexes. As we might anticipate, though it too diverges rather 
substantively from the norms of classical śāstra, it offers a very different mode reasoning and 
is fixated in different types of concerns than the popular philosophy of the Śākta inflected job 
site we have just been exploring. 
How to Learn the Āgama and How Not to Tell a Story: The Piṅgalāmata and the 
Sociology of Knowledge in Medieval India 
It is unexpected serendipity that a text largely devoted to imparting the procedures guiding the 
construction of physical objects also offers us what is perhaps the most detailed account of 
773 
pedagogy thus far located in a Tantric source. Here, then, intertwined with a telling account of 
the social and ritual conditions that make effective teaching possible, are the rules for teaching 
and learning the Bhairava Āgamas: 
Therefore, the Āgama should be listened to and recited [to such a person]. O one with good observances, this illustrates the rule for the teaching of the Bhairava Āgama. In a charming, even, pure maṇḍapa to the east of the yāgaśāla or on a portion of the ground smeared with plaster, there, one should cause to have done an exposition [of the Tantra]. 
Facing east or north, a person should be pure, with their mind attending to the subject at hand. Having made the three beat sounds [tapping with the heel], with the astra mantra, the directions should be protected. 
[Next,] one installs that which has the nature of one’s own practice, inside and outside [one’s own body]. Then, [the teacher] meditates on the attainment of omniscience: that oneself alone is Śiva, one who is steadfast in regard to mercy toward all, who is the agent of compassion towards all beings, who is the cause of grace for all, the foremost [source of] gnosis, who is the uplifter. One should surrender [to him or he should offer] before the guru. 
If the [specialized] vidyā is to be given to an elder, a brother or the paternal relative who has the common vidyā, out of affection, he can do it only when he has received approval [from his guru]. 
Listen to how the Tantra is to be listened to according to the rule. The recitation turban must be made, and the yogapīṭha must be made for the sake of the purpose at hand.750 
The Piṅgalāmata’s account of a teaching prep session begins with the series of steps 
that precede any generic Tantric ritual. First, the material environment has to be prepared. One 
must check to see that the ground is clean and level and the pavilion where the teaching and 
homa sacrifices will take place have to be constructed. Once the space is arranged in a 
750Piṅgalāmata: tasmād āgāmaḥ śrotavyo vyākhyeyaḥ yas tasya suvrate bhairavākhyāgamasyaiva niyamo ’yaṃ udāhṛtaḥ / suprasanne same śuddhe maṇḍape yāgapūrvake / sudhālipte ‘tha bhūbhāge vyākhyānaṃ tatra kārayet // prāṅmukhodaṅmukho vāpi śucis tadgatamānasaḥ / tālāśabdatrayaṃ kṛtvā diśām astreṇa rakṣayet // svānuṣṭhānātmakaṃ nyastvā sabāhyābhyantareṇa tu / dhyātvā sarvajñatāvṛttiṃ svayam eva śivo yathā // sarvakāruṇiko dhīraḥ sarvasatvānukampakaḥ / sarvānugrahahetvarthaṃ jñānamukhyaḥ samudyamī // nivedayed vā gurau pūrvaṃ jyeṣṭhe bhrātari paitrake / samānavidyayā vidyāt snehād vā yadi saṃmataḥ // śrotṛbhi vidhipūrvaṃ tu śrotavyaṃ ca yathā śṛṇu / vyākhyāpaṭṭaḥ prakarttavyaḥ yogapīṭho ‘rthahetukam // 
774 
preliminary fashion, the direction guardians must be appeased and energetic protections have 
to be put in place to prevent intrusions by unwanted supernatural outsiders who might disrupt 
or distort the ritual. Next, like any ritualist, the teacher must purify his own inner being, first 
by cleansing away his own imperfections and subjectivity and then by identifying with the 
deity and its pantheon. In this case, internal practice appears to be coordinated with an external 
invocation of the same pantheon in exactly the same fashion into a designated ritual space 
within the outside world. Having aligned himself with the currents of his tradition in general 
terms, the teacher next sets out more specifically to attain identification with Śiva and 
conscious embodied realization that Śiva alone exists. Then, he attunes himself quite 
specifically to the aspect of the lord that is characterized by limitless grace and compassion. 
As the guests who will be attending the lecture arrive, exclusive attention to the 
performance of esoteric practices has to be balanced with the guru and his community playing 
host. The eligibility of the potential attendees has to be discerned, and if there are any 
ambiguities, the ācārya giving his talk has to consult with his guru to make certain that the 
offering of the teaching is appropriate to this audience. As the text rather bluntly informs us, 
the successful transmission of an esoteric Tantra is equally dependent on two discrete forms of 
preparation. Unsurprisingly, the first dimension involves performance of rituals anchored in 
acts of ascesis and mimesis that instantiate specific modes of consciousness in the transmitting 
agent. What we probably would not anticipate, however, is that equal weight and in fact far 
more attention is given to proper preparation of the prerequisite material culture, which is 
understood as essential to the task of teaching. First, before performing the vyākhyāna, the 
teacher needs the proper sort of turban or a hat. While this matter is dealt with in a cursory 
fashion, most likely because the fashioning of such an item fell under the purview of a different 
775 
caste community, the fashioning of just the right kind of yogapīṭha, in this case, a kind of stool 
that the listener is to sit on during the discourse, is not only treated in excruciating detail but 
the highly specific cultural cache of distinctive types of seats is fetishized every bit as much as 
a lululemon yoga mat in a modern yoga studio. 
This should be made with various types of wood starting with śrīparṇika, without wounds in the wood, possessing auspicious characteristics. It is two hands long with one aṅgula. It should be broad with an extra hand [measure in length]. The above is the case if it is the seat of the ācārya; it is the main type. However, if it is for a listener, the stool is 40 aṅgulas in height and in length. In breadth, it is nine aṅgulas total. 
The two feet are extended a hands distance, as previously, O beloved. The two feet are fashioned like elephant feet with toenails that have faces in the middle. At the juncture of that [the feet], there should be a pair of conches—one should fashion that facing forward. One should ornament the middle of the pīṭha with decorative leaves and vines. Above that you should adorn it with some flowers with a lotus in the middle. Just like that, on the sides there are to be depicted lotuses with auspicious characteristics. At the edges of those two it is to be weighed down with by a garland consisting of sugarcane leaves. This should be done for the guru by one who has the aim of listening to the guru. 
The yogapīṭha is to be made by the sādhaka [for himself] as previously. In height, the stool is thirty-six fingers in length with a breadth of six [measures]. When the listener is the putraka, just as for the main figure [the ācārya], O pretty colored one, then, the yogapīṭha is to be made with a length of thirty aṅgulas [smallest]; by the measure of four aṅgulas, that is to be extended, as previously. In regard to one who previously bore another religious signifier but now is with God [i.e., a convert], the yogapīṭha is as previously with regard to the main figure, but measuring twenty-four aṅgulas. The rest is as previously. The extended dimension is also to be two aṅgulas; it is characterized by good qualities.751 
751Piṅgalāmata: sa ca śrīparṇikādyais tu nirvaṇaṃ śubhalakṣaṇaḥ / dvikaraḥ sāgulo dīrghaḥ karasārddhaṃ ca vistṛtaṃ // yadācāryas tu mukhyena śrotā caiva sureśvari / catvāriṃśāṅgulair yuktaṃ yogapīṭhaṃ tadantataḥ // dīrghena vistṛtenaiva navasaṃkhyāṃgulaṃ bhavet / pādau dvau karam āyātau pūrvavad vistṛtau priye // gajapādeva pādau ca sanakhau madhyavaktrakau / tatsaṃdhau śaṃkhayugmaṃ tu saṃmukhaṃ taṃ prakalpet // patravallīvicitrais tu pīṭhamadhye tu citrayet / tadūrddhve madhyapadmaṃ ca kiñcit puṣpitaval likhet // tadvat pakṣau prakartavyau paṅkajau śubhalakṣaṇau / tayor ante khaṇḍapatramañjaryā cāvalambitā // guror hy evaṃ prakartavyaṃ guruṇāṃ śravaṇārthinā / ṣaḍbhis triṃśāṅgulair yuktaṃ dairghye ṣaḍvistareṇa tu // sādhakena prakarttavyaṃ yogapīṭhaṃ yathā purā / yadā mukhyas tu śrotā vai putrako varavarṇini / tadā tridaśair aṅgulair yogapīṭhaṃ ca dīrghataḥ / vistṛtaṃ tat samākhyātaṃ caturaṅgulamānataḥ // pūrvavac cheṣarūpaṃ tu karttavyaṃ śubhalakṣaṇam / tatpūrvas tu yadā mukhyaṃ liṅginaḥ seśvaro ’pi vā / caturviṃśāṅgulair yuktaṃ yogapīṭhaṃ ca pūrvavat / dyaṅgulaṃ vistṛtaṃ tasya lakṣaṇena vilakṣitam // 
776 
As we have seen again and again, like with so many other texts written on the margins 
of scholastic knowledge production, the Piṅgalāmata all but assails us with the rich intricacies 
of an ephemeral material culture, most of which we can only access through the heavily fogged 
up window of the technical instructions guiding its assemblage. When working in wood to 
produce the furniture used for a Śākta-Śaiva dharma talk—and this as we shall was by no 
means an everyday occurrence—artisans did not merely churn out simple utilitarian 
handicrafts, but worked the wood with care and skill, adorning its surfaces with representations 
of flowers, leaves, and animals faces, yielding the sort of end results that today we would 
reimagine as a work of art. The focused deployment of specific motifs and the care invested in 
different approaches to engineering distinctive types of stools executed at a range of scales, 
however, served important semiotic functions. 
Indeed, every aspect of the material culture in such a lecture hall was designed to 
communicate and enact specific social hierarchies among the devotees in a manner that 
instantly spatially conveyed who belonged where. As Dominic Goodall conveyed to me as we 
were reading through this passage, if one gets down into the nitty gritty details of visualizing 
the relative scale and dimensions of the different categories of yogapīṭha assigned to an ācārya, 
the invited listener, the sādhaka, the regular putraka and the intended successor of the guru, 
all the way down to the convert from another tradition, another rather important aspect of this 
arrangement comes into sharp relief. An aṅgula, after all as we have seen, is a rather small unit 
of measurement. Succinctly, the people higher up in the hierarchy not only get more elevated 
stools, as befits their prestige, they also get more comfortable ones. In fact, by the time you get 
down to the sādhaka, ranked unusually low in this system, to say nothing of the convert, the 
yogapīṭha becomes less of a working piece of furniture and more an assigned encumbrance, 
777for its seat is too small to fit the average sized human bottom, and its height is so low that all 
one can manage is a precarious squatting position likely much less comfortable than merely 
sitting on the ground. 
Before everyone sits down in their perhaps very uncomfortable seats, the guru who will 
give the discourse must first be welcomed and appeased. When this concludes, in turn, the 
guru guides the assembled disciples in the welcoming and the appeasement of the deities of 
the Śākta pantheon. 
In this fashion, with a mind well concentrated, having accomplished his daily tasks, he places the well-worshipped book seated on an āsana with the palm leaves threaded together in front of the yogapīṭha, accompanied by writing chalk and a cloth āsana, along with [offerings of] fragrances, unopened forest flowers, and the like. 
Having set this down before the yogapīṭha, the disciple appeases the guru: “[Take this, and] by your grace, He Nātha! Cause this little foolish mind [of mine] to become expanded.” 
Thus, the guru, who bears auspicious sovereign authority [śrīmān], is pleased, and his mind is rendered ready for performing the auspicious commentary. In the middle of the lotus, the imperishable should be written. He praises the root text and the commentary [or mūlavyākhyānaṃ, commentary on the root text]. There, the Śaiva ācārya should sacrifice to Bhairava or the śaktis. In the lotus previously fashioned, on the left-hand side, he should sacrifice to the line of the gurus. 
On the right side in the lotus, he should worship the jñānasūtra [mūla of the text] and the chalk (khaṭikā). The worship should be done with fragrance and flowers or, if it is special worship, with special substances. Having praised Śiva and the goddess of language, and likewise the king of obstacles, having praised the guru and the gnosis guru, he should proclaim the connection [anubandhacatuṣṭaya].752 
As Florinda De Simini has explored with great care and insight, albeit in regard to much 
more pacific ritual systems, just as in the act of vidyādāna where books are copied and then 
752Piṅgalāmata: anena kramayogena saṃyataḥ susamāhitaḥ / tathāhnikaṃ suptavanyagandhapuṣpādibhir yutaḥ // kaṭitrāsanasamyuktaḥ kariṇīkhaṭikānvitaḥ / yogapīṭhāgrataḥ sthāpya guruṃ caiva prasādayet // tvatprasādāc ca he nātha mandabuddhiṃ vikāsaya / śarayantrāsanāsīnaṃ jñānaṃ caiva sūpujitam // tato yā tato hṛṣṭo guruḥ śrīmān vyākhyānodyatamānasaḥ / madhyapadme ’vyayo likhyo mūlaṃ vyākhyānāṃ prastute // śaivācāryo yajet tatra bhairavaṃ vātha śaktayaḥ // gurupaṃkti yajed vāme kamale pūrvakalpite / khaṭikā jñānasūtraṃ ca dakṣiṇe kamala‘rcayet / gandhapuṣpādibhiḥ pūjya viśeṣaṃ ced viśeṣakaiḥ / śivaṃ vāgīśvarīṃ stutvā vighnarājan tathaiva ca / guruṃ jñānaguruṃ stutvā sambandhau dvau prakāśayet // sa ca sādhāraṇau hy ekas tv anyo sādhāraṇo bhavet/ 
778 
offered as gifts, the teaching of a Tantra commences with the ritual worship of the book.753 
The implement that will be used either by the teacher to sketch out diagrams, to record key 
points, or perhaps even one of his chief disciples to take their lecture notes is also offered the 
appropriate acts of reverence. As the disciples go before their guru to present these items, he 
is addressed in effusive devotional terms. Although short, this passage and many others like it 
in our text pose serious problems for our historiography. Two possibilities pose themselves. 
We could have here what was then a rare instance of the idiom we think of as late Śākta or 
post-Tantric guru devotion, prefiguring a register that will become ubiquitous in religious 
communities during the early modern period. Otherwise, given its production and circulation 
outside the normal networks that in apparent absence of other evidence we have conflated with 
the totality of discourse on the ground in South Asia, it suggests that such a mode of expression 
and its accompanying values had been integral to life-world of religious communities on the 
subcontinent for far longer than we have recognized but perhaps was simply not considered a 
proper object of systematic scholastic knowledge and thus is missing from most of our sources. 
Just how much the boundaries of what constitutes esoteric and devotional knowledge 
has shifted over the centuries is made plain by another facet of this same passage. As we have 
just seen, in effusive devotional terms, before he beings his discourse, in a language instantly 
recognizable to anyone who has encountered the Trika and its Kashmiri sūtric and śāstric 
revelations, the guru is entreated to cause the small and ignorant (manda) mind of his disciple 
to become quite literally “expanded” (vikāsa) through the reception of the teaching. As we 
shall see, the Piṅgalāmata is indeed an “esoteric” text rooted in Śākta traditions of revelation 
that partakes of a theology of divine grace, gnosis achieved through ecstatic possession, and 
753See Florinda De Simini, Of Gods and Books: Ritual and Knowledge Transmission in the Manuscript Cultures of Premodern India (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2016), especially chapters 2 (pg. 83–128) and 4 (pg. 331–39). 
779 
non-dualist or pantheist epistemology. Such dimensions of the work, while essential to its 
worldview, form only a small part of its contents. The majority of the Piṅgalāmata’s 
esotericism is of another sort entirely—instantiated in its secret transmission of guild-specific 
highly technical instruction in artisanal craft, modes of calculation and measurement, specific 
iconographical programs, and marvels of engineering and design. In violation of our own 
expectations of how we tend to imagine “Indic spirituality,” when the disciple asks his mind 
to become expanded so that he can receive the teaching, the majority of what is about to be 
taught are litanies pertaining to the proportionality of the various components that make up a 
building as well as the codes of conduct to be observed when one is on the job site. 
More specifically, from the perspective of the history of yogic traditions, it is of the 
utmost importance that within a scripted dialogue that both entextualizes and formalizes actual 
social practice, the guru is addressed as “he nātha.” In other words, already by the ninth 
century, to be a Śākta ācārya dedicated to the worship of Bhairava and the yoginīs and holding 
the office of sthānācārya or pratiṣṭhāpanācārya is virtually by definition to be the kind of 
social agent who disciples address as nātha. As we have seen in chapter 4 in the case of 
Kaḷēśvara or Kaḷanātha, engaged in ritual worship of pantheons connected to the Trika, the 
Brahmayāmala, the Western Transmission of the goddess Kubjikā, and likely the Krama, the 
inscriptional records of medieval Deccan abound in accounts of ācāryas who bear initiatory 
names ending in –īśvara, who are in a literal sense both “nāthas” and “yogins.”754 This 
somewhat obvious observation holds substantial consequences for historicizing the emergence 
754The thirteenth-century Cintrā praśasti offers testament to the porous nature of these boundaries. For there, even after we have seen the emergence of lineages that much more pointedly associate themselves with the Nātha siddhas, after he has made pilgrimage of Śaiva pīṭhas at Kedara, Prayaga, Srisailam and Ramesvaram, when the Pāśupata Tripurāntakeśvara celebrates his return to Prabhāsakṣetra by building a new temple in honor of his mother near Somanātha, he has installed in its maṇḍapa images of Bhairava, Hanuman, Sarasvatī, and Gaṇeśa, as we might expect, but also of Gorakṣanātha. 
780 
of the so-called Nātha Sampradāya. Instead of a specific search for institutional origins, we are 
left with “nātha” as simply a longstanding generic title for the Śākta ācārya par excellence. In 
this way, while attending to the deep history of the social and theological milieu remains 
important, the analytical focus of such an intellectual endeavor shifts it to telling a different 
kind of conceptual history, much of it in the spirit John Stratton Hawley has been exploring 
for some years, about the articulation of the concept of saṃpradāya as a form of community 
self-fashioning native to a specific early modern and very frequently Mughal milieu, wherein 
certain legal and social processes began to necessitate much more specific and evident 
articulations of community identity and belonging.755 
For the next several dozen verses, the Piṅgalāmata offers what is essentially a medieval 
guide to professional development for the working educator who has already professionalized 
himself by becoming a Bhairava-worshipping Śākta yogin and acting building project 
manager, and in this capacity has been enlisted in the task of providing continuing education 
to his work force. At the point in pedagogical process where the modern academic might 
introduce the texts her students will be studying by guiding them through the syllabus, 
explicating the course objectives, and then offering an introduction to how the current course 
of study related to the rest of subjects a student has explored during their time in the university 
system, before it turns to presenting “best-practices” for the beginning lecturer, the 
Piṅgalāmata offers its own crash course in the outlining of learning objectives. 
That which is well known in all the Tantras is said to be general [knowledge]. As for that which is established in this Tantra, they know that to be the uncommon [knowledge]. 
755In recognizing that the articulation of the four-fold Dasanāmī identity is roughly concurrent with the articulation of the four Vaiṣṇava sampradāyas, both of which happen in the sixteenth century, Jack Hawley has suggested such a model in passing in A Storm of Songs and numerous times in public presentations. See John Stratton Hawley, A Storm of Songs: India and the Idea of the Bhakti Movement (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2015), 220–224. 
781 
Now I will tell you what is the subject matter of this Tantra, which is the connection [outlining teaching objectives] here [in this system]: subject matter, the facilitating cause, the agent, the extent of the text, and the purpose. In the beginning, the lecturer should proclaim these [five] things and after that the speaker should describe [further things].756 
In much the same manner as the special teachers’ edition of a textbook, in its first 
chapter, the Piṅgalāmata here alternates between two kinds of discourse. In most passages, we 
are presented with the actual contents that the ācārya is supposed to integrate into his discourse 
when teaching the text—right down to exact phrases. Intermittently, as the final sentence in 
the above passage, we also are privy to helpful instructions intended for the teacher’s own 
benefit which presumably originally were not to be shared with an audience. In the first 
collection of verses, the content under discussion amounts to a brief outline of the sociology 
of knowledge followed by an introduction to discipline specific technical jargon and its 
approach to thinking with texts. The Piṅgalāmata presents itself as offering particularized or 
specialized (viśeṣaṇa) knowledge that builds upon an assumed repertoire of general Tantric 
knowledge. In addition to the canons of normal analytical categories used to evaluate works of 
śāstras in general, the famous anubandhacatuṣṭaya, our text prepares the audience for the 
eventual reception of a new set of discourse specific theoretical categories for making sense of 
how the different chapters in a work connect together to make a cohesive whole. First, 
however, as it has promised, it analyzes the work in terms of its name, subject matter, the 
source of its authority, the length and version of the work that will be studied, as well as the 
efficient cause and agent responsible for its production. 
What is the name of this Tantra? It is called the Piṅgalāmata. [What is the subject?] It is a procedure for ritual installation. Deriving its authority from the Jayadrathayāmala, 
756Piṅgalāmata: sarve tantraprasiddhas tu sādhāraṇāḥ sa ucyate / asya tantrasya yaḥ siddhas tad asādhāraṇam viduḥ // idānī saṃpravakṣyāmi sambandhātraiva yad bhavet / abhidhānaṃ nimittaṃ ca kartāram parimāṇakam // prayojanaṃ kathitvādau paścād vaktrānuvarṇayet / 
782 
it falls within the Brahmayāmala. [The goddess] Piṅgalā Bhaṭṭārikā is the efficient cause. Who is the author? Bhagavān Śrīkaṇṭhanātha. How long is it supposed to be? Three and a half thousand verses. And it is divided twofold. There is the Kāmarūpī form and Uḍḍiyānī form. This one is the Kāmarūpī.757 
What is the purpose? The purpose is for providing knowledge concerning the definition of the installation of manifest and unmanifest liṅgas. Although the liṅga can be either manifest or unmanifest, the base form of the liṅga is unmanifest. 
The manifest one is the one conjoined with the characteristics of all the parts that are manifest [i.e., this is the mūrti]. But, the both manifest and unmanifest is characterized as having both forms [it is a liṅga with faces]. As for that, it is an image that has a god who is only the face above the heart [i.e., a bust]. It is manifest in the upper part of the Brahmā, Viṣṇu, or Rudra [quadrant of the liṅga]. 
Having first set down [this pentad], after that, the teacher should explain. According to the speech, he should repeat it.758 
Distilled down to its fundamentals, this passage executes two functions. First, it begins 
to delineate the Piṅgalāmata’s place within the canon of revealed scriptures in a manner that 
makes evident why it is an authoritative source. Second, it outlines the core purpose of the text, 
which is to provide the definitions of different varieties of focuses for worship and instructions 
for making them. Let us begin by addressing the more transparent second dimension of the 
Tantra. In the typical manner of a technical treatise on ritual installation and building 
construction, the Piṅgalāmata speaks of the liṅga as signifying any focus of worship and 
divides it into the categories of unmanifest, manifest, and both manifest and unmanifest. In the 
case of the unmanifest (avyakta) type, the lexeme liṅga refers to the aniconic either vaguely or 
757As we will see in chapter nine, Kāmarūpa and Kāmākhyā in Deccani discourse commonly seem to refer to a sacred Śākta center in the Prabhāsakṣetra in Saurasthra, and not to the famous pīṭhā in Assam. 758Piṅgalāmata: asya tat tasya kā saṃjñā piṅgalāmatasaṃjñā / pratiṣṭhākalpaṃ jayadrathādhikāraṃ brahmayāmalasyāntapatīti / piṅgalā bhaṭṭārikā yo nimittaṃ / kaḥ kartā bhagavān śrīkaṇṭhanāthaḥ kartā / kiyantaḥ parimāṇāḥ / adhyuṣṭasahasram iti / sa ca dvividhaṃ kāmarūpy oḍayonīṃ / ayaṃ ca kāmarūpī / kiṃ prayojanaṃ / vyaktāvyaktaliṅgapratiṣṭhālakṣaṇam parijñānārthaṃ prayojanaṃ / vyaktāvyaktam api tu liṅgarūpamātram avyaktaṃ iti / vyaktasarvāvayavalakṣaṇayukto vyaktam iti / vyaktāvyaktam ubhayarūpo lakṣaṇam iti / sa cobhayaḥ rūpahṛdūrddhvamukhamātraṃ devayuktam iti / brahmaviṣṇurudrordhvabhāgārdhabhāgavyaktam iti / etat prāg nidhāya paścād vaktānuvarṇayet / anukathayed iti vacanāt / 
783 
quite evidently phallic shaped form that we commonly identify as a śivaliṅga, though, as our 
text will explain, in practice a whole host of other deities can be made to abide in such a form. 
In contrast, when a liṅga is said to be at once both unmanifest and unmanifest (vyaktāvyakta), 
the intended point of referent is an aniconic image onto which have been carved or engraved 
iconic representations of one or more faces of the deity. Finally, like virtually every other work 
on pratiṣṭhā, our texts labels as a manifest (vyakta) liṅga any fully representational figure 
representing a deity. In other words, it treats figure we might label as mūrti, icon, or “idol” as 
just another kind of liṅga. 
When it comes to placing the Piṅgalāmata itself in context, as has so often proven to 
be the case throughout the last chapter, images speak much more vividly and transparently than 
words. To your left is a series of life size images preserved in situ on a fortified stone gate from 
the late twelfth or early thirteenth century at a place called Dabhoi in Gujarat, less than an hour 
from the capitol at Baroda. The figure on the top represents one of the few surviving images 
in India of a Tantric Śākta god and goddess in yāmala. As Jim Mallinson is in the process of 
documenting, the figure on the bottom is one of a series of identifiable Nātha yogins, who seem 
to appear as labelled images for the first time in the historical record at Dabhoi. 
784 
Thanks to Amar Reddy for sharing his detailed images of Dabhoi.

Long before the term 
referred to the leftmost 
channel in the subtle body, as 
the sixth-century treatise of 
Varāhamihira informs us, the 
lexeme Piṅgalā designated a 
nocturnal bird, resembling 
some sort of crane but of a 
species yet to be determined. 
Possibly, it is some sort of 
nocturnal parrot. The 
defining feature of the 
animals was its terrible 
piercing cry, and it was 
typically grouped alongside 
the jackal and the owl as a 
lizard, we are told that a person who has bathed either in the evening or at midnight who wishes 
to know his fortune should go at midnight to the tree where the piṅgalā bird has perched. 
Worshipping the tree with new cloth and sandalwood paste, without naming the usual gods, 
the practitioner is supposed to address the tree and the bird in which it resides with the 
following mantra: “O bestower of good fortune, I entreat you to divine my thoughts, for you 
are praised as knowing all languages. . . . O bestower of good fortune, I call upon you to 
indicate the signs concerning the success or failure of the matter under consideration.”760 At 
this point, the petitioner is to insist that he will keep the night vigil with the bird and only leave 
in the morning when it has answered in his inquiry. The piṅgalā bird provides guidance through 
the texture of its cries and its movements in the tree. If the bird says “ciril-viril,” or just stays 
silent all evening, this is a sign that the endeavor will succeed, while if it says “dis” or “kuca- 
kuca,” this a sign that there will be much mental suffering. Alternatively, one can also 
determine the probability that the intended activity will be a failure, a partial, or a complete 
success based on where the bird choses to perch in the tree. If it remains on the top, things are 
looking up. If it resides in the middle, the prognosis is middling. If it descends to the bottom, 
one should change one’s course or prepare for total failure. 
In relating this archaic passage to the matters with which we are most concerned, we 
would do well to attend to a keen observation offered by David White towards the very end of 
Kiss of the Yoginī: Tantric Sex in its South Asian Context. The passage is worth quoting in full. 
‘rthasiddhiḥ / atyākulatvaṃ diśikāraśabde kucākucety evam udāhṛte vā // avāk pradāne ’pi hitārthasiddhiḥ pūrvouktadikcakraphalair ato ‘nyat / vācyaṃ phalaṃ cottamamadhyanīcaśākhāsthitāyāṃ varamadhyanīcam // 760Bṛhatsaṃhitā, vol. 2., pg. 146, 87.42–44: viddhi bhadre mayā yat tvam imam arthaṃ pracoditā / kalyāṇi sarvavacasāṃ veditrī tvaṃ prakīrtyase // apṛcche ‘dya gamiṣyāmi veditaś ca punas tv aham / prātar āgamya pṛcche tvām āgneyīṃ diśam āśritaḥ // pracodayāmy ahaṃ yat tvāṃ tan me vyākhyātum arhasi / svaceṣṭitena kalyāṇi yathā vedmi nirākulam / 
787The flight of the Yoginī—or at least the airborne (khecara) division of Yoginīs—is altogether natural once one recalls the origins of their cults. Like a great number of female deities (or demonesses) before them, the Yoginīs were often identified in mythology, sculpture, and ritual as winged figures, or indeed as birds. These are in fact the living creatures most frequently encountered at their favorite terrestrial haunt, the cremation ground, where human “witches,” jackals (śivās), and carrion-eating birds are all identified as Yoginīs, whence their description, in the twelfth-century Dvāśraya, as “the filthy birds of night.” It is altogether natural, then, that so many of the medieval Yoginī images portray them as zoocephalic or avicephalic figures, possessed of human bodies and limbs, but the heads of animals or birds. Like their Kushan-era forerunners, the Yoginīs are quite frequently portrayed as bird-headed in temple sculptures from ninth- to tenth century Madhya Pradesh: these include the Yoginī Piṅgalā at the Bherghat Yoginī temple, Jabalpuri; Jaūti, from Rewa, now housed in the Dhubela Archaeological Museum, Dhubela; and the Yoginī Umā from the Naresar Yoginī temple, now housed in the Gwalior Archaeological Museum.761 
The passages we have just been exploring not only provides powerful confirmation of 
White’s hypothesis that the figure of the yoginī itself in many cases descends directly from 
birds, but points to the tantalizing possibility that key conceptual associations and elements of 
the medieval rituals associated with their invocation and appeasement also have a genetic 
connection to pre-Tantric traditions of ritual augury involving interaction with actual birds. 
Despite the fact that he even mentions in passing the goddess Piṅgalā in her Madhyadeśī 
incarnation at the very end of this passage, perhaps because his rhetorical focus is on the facet 
of the worship of yoginīs associated with their role as procurers and consumers of transgressive 
substances, White does not seem to have noticed this discussion in Varāhamihira. Clearly 
however, in the sixth century, Varāhamihira is already aware of a form of ritual performed 
starting at midnight that is marked as conceptually distinct from normal religion. It involves 
seeking esoteric knowledge, in the sense that it is non-public and extra sensory, from a special 
kind of being. The being in question is viewed as bearing vidyā and knowing all languages, 
one of the less sanguinary aspects of later traditions of yoginī worship. Much as in many 
761David Gordon White, Kiss of the Yoginī: “Tantric Sex” in Its South Asian Contexts (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006), 205. 
788 
Tantric yogas, the success or failure of the practice is even marked by the hearing the right 
kind of special sound at the completion of the ritual. Indeed, practically the only thing that 
marks this proto-sādhanā as distinct from the sort of rites we find in the later Śākta Tantras is 
that there are not any specific preparatory practices outlined, we are not yet in the cremation 
ground, and that the creature whose favor is being beseeched is an actual bird. 
It is perhaps possible that further studies, especially of unpublished corpuses, will 
enable a more meticulous documentation of this progression from bird to yoginī, but regardless, 
by the time the forty-fourth chapter of the Picumata Brahmayāmala is composed, perhaps in 
the middle or late seventh century, the lines between these categories have become quite 
blurred.762 For here we find enjoined that the mantrin is to worship the yoginīs, commencing 
with entity called pūtanā, in a cremation ground or by an ant hill. As the Piṅgalāmata itself 
makes plain, this mantrin is in fact the direct antecedent of our own ācārya, the very class of 
person responsible for teaching our text, a task that, as we have seen, begins with a cursory 
pūjā dedicated to Bhairava or the yoginīs. Before commencing his worship, in contrast, the 
Picumata tells us the mantrin is to bow to the owl, to the piṅgalā, and likewise to all the other 
creatures that go about in the night. Because of the manner in which the text is written, perhaps 
rather intentionally, it does not make clear whether we are talking about supernatural yoginīs 
or animals that are revered as signifying their possible presence. 
As we have seen in the first division of the present chapter, our Piṅgalāmata describes 
itself as the falling within the scope of the tradition of the Brahmayāmala and deriving its 
762Brahmayāmala 44.164–167: evaṃ pratidinaṃ [k: -na] kuryāt kulavidyāt samūdgiram [k: -tam] / yoginyaḥ [k: yoginya] pūtanādyāś ca namaskṛtvā punaḥ punaḥ // catvaremekavṛkṣe ca smaśāne vālmike [k: vātmike] tathā / kulavidyā samuccārya puṣpāṇ i tu vinikṣipet // eteṣveva hi sthāneṣu yoginyā pūtanādayaḥ |namaskṛtvā [k: namaḥ skṛtvā ] vrajet mantrī ulūkaṃ piṅgalās tathā // śavdaṃ śrutvā namaskāryo anyāś ca [k: anyoś ca] niśicāriṇām / evam āhu vratā nisyu? ācāraṃ paśyate yadā // 
789 
authority from the canon of the Jayadrathayāmala, and thus is quite self-conscious of at least 
certain aspects of the sort of genealogies we are in the process of reconstructing. As with most 
Tantras, the work takes the form of a dialogue. Here, it is the goddess Piṅgalā, standing in for 
the novice artisan, who asks most of the questions. Her lover Bhairava, occasionally identified 
as Śrīkaṇṭhanātha, offers the instructions. Indeed, as the meta-analysis in the first chapter of 
Tantric textuality makes plain, the goddess Piṅgalā can be called the nimitta or the facilitating 
cause of the revelation of the Tantra precisely because she asks all the questions. In turn, the 
God is deemed the agent because he provides the answers that contain the technical and 
doctrinal materials that must be imparted to the students. In fact, the second chapter of the 
Piṅgalāmata presents a tableau that informs the reader that the context in which the whole of 
its discourse is taking place is somewhere quite like the cremation grounds. 
The great yoga (mahāyoga) [the yāmala of Śiva and Śakti] is encircled by the great mothers. It is established on the periphery of the womb of Mahāmāya. It is the state that confers great delight. 
Accompanied by vetālas, with ear ornaments, having legs as long as palm trees, by dwarves, by nāyakas, by siddha yogins, and other ones such as [the sage] Bhṛṅgi and [the demon] Dāruka, Bhairava, the god of the gods, Lord of the mad, dances, praised by the sound of cries of victory and music, and prose and poetry of countless sorts.763 
Having seen him, the pleased lord, [the goddess] Piṅgalā, following the injunction, spoke the text to everyone assembled. Piṅgalā said: 
O Lord of the Sādhakas! To those who have taken refuge with the religious signifier that brings accomplishment, the focus of study and the definition, which have the form of the standard and the measurement, were previously imparted. 
O lord, I do not know what the liṅga is and what sort of folks know about that sort of thing. Who is the guru? Who are the śilpins? Who is the agent, and what it is the activity that must be done?764 
763It is unclear here whether Bhairava is the Lord of the mad (unmattanāyaka) or Lord of the mantras (mantranāyaka), as the manuscript tradition offers both readings. 764Piṅgalāmata: mahāmāyodarāntasthaṃ mahāyogaṃ samāvṛtaṃ / mahāvinodagaṃ bhāvaṃ mahāmātṛbhiḥ saṃyutam // vetālais tālajaṃghais tu tāḍijaṃghais tu vāmanaiḥ / nāyakaiḥ siddhayogībhis tathānyair bhṛṅgidārakaiḥ // nṛtyate jayavādyaiś ca gadyapadyair anekaśaḥ / saṃstuto deva deveśo bhairavo mattanāyakaḥ 
790 
As we can see, when the work begins, we are in middle of a raucous celebration 
involving a motley crew of denizens of the cremation grounds, presented perhaps quite 
intentionally at a range of scales, from towering vetālas to dwarves. All of these beings are 
dancing, to the accompaniment of celebratory ejaculations and music and literary 
performances. A range of suggestive language, from the invocation of the womb of mahāmāyā 
and the practice of Mahāyoga, hints that another sort of ejaculation may have just taken place 
as the god and the goddess finish their love-making that confers the state of great delight. Thus, 
perhaps post-coitus, everyone settles down and the goddess Piṅgalā begins to address the 
assembled throng.765 
All at once, we descend from the rarefied rhetorical heights of orgiastic union to an 
extremely mundane—even rudimentary register—reminiscent of preprofessional training. 
Standing in for the new convert to the traditions of the artisans, the goddess Piṅgalā begins 
asking extremely basic questions. What is a liṅga? Who knows about such things? What is the 
guru? Who is an artisan and, most fundamentally, how do we do our jobs? At the heart of this 
discipline, the text informs us again and again, is the “standard and measures” (pramāṇa and 
māna) imparted to the just inducted artisan. Bhairava, we are told is not merely mad (unmatta), 
but he is mad for measure (māna), and so too must be his acolytes. In its three and half thousand 
// taṃ dṛṣṭvā harṣitaṃ nāthaṃ sarve ‘py atra samāgatāḥ / vidhipūrvakṛtenaiva piṅgalā vākyaṃ abravīt // [piṅgalovāca] siddhiliṅgāśritānāṃ ca pūrvoktaṃ sādhakeśvara / lakṣyalakṣaṇasaṃyuktaṃ pramāṇonmānarūpakam // tan mayā deva na jñātaṃ kiṃ liṅgaṃ kena tat smṛtaṃ / ko guruḥ śilpinaś caiva [sakhā?] kartṛkriyā [yatham?] // 765If we assume that it intends to depict of the very end the yāmala, the text is not clear about whether the goddess who has just been joined to the god is in actuality the same as Piṅgalā. It is also possible that in this scene the bird headed yoginī merely asks the mad lord of the universe to tell her about the art and craft of making images shortly after he decouples from his union with the supreme goddess. Indeed, apart from the typical format of the dialogue between god and goddess, a strongly subordinate questioner is featured in range of other Tantric texts, such as the Parākhya and Kiraṇa. What makes such a dynamic less likely as that nowhere here in the body of the text is another supreme goddess defined as distinct from Piṅgalā invoked and the epithets that are addressed to her by the god throughout our dialogue include such superlatives as the mistress of all being. Still, the possibility should not be wholly discounted.

verses, the recension of the Piṅgalāmata available to us, which is the one associated with 
Kāmarūpa as opposed to Uḍḍiyāna, sets out to transmit this highly esoteric knowledge, 
comprised in a good part of portions of different types of parts of buildings and images, first 
to the assembled throng of supernatural beings and then by extension to their human analogs 
among the śivabhaktas.

In contrast to the vast majority of the work, which seems at least to the modern scholar 
not versed in the genre thoroughly disorganized, the first chapter aims at a synthetic 
conceptualization of the relationship between part and whole so sophisticated that it is perhaps 
indicative of originating as an interpolation. Resuming where we had left off before, having 
just completed its analysis of how the form of the text relates to its function in the terms of the 
standard category, the Piṅgalāmata now introduces its own unique theory of exegesis: the 
discipline-specific connection (abhisambandha). 
At the beginning, the abhisambandha is to be spoken. And it is said to be threefold. 1) So, there is the thing to be descended and the descent, and the relationship between those two. 2) There is the thing to be suggested, the suggester, and the relationship between those two. 3) There is the thing to be revealed, the revealer, and the connection. Among those, the ācārya and the śāstra, the thing to be descended is the śāstra and the agent of its descending is the ācārya. 
Now the definition of the relationship between the thing to be suggested and the suggesting agent is stated. That which is defined by defining a thing is the thing that causes it to manifest. 
The definition of the thing to be described is the suggester. The definition of the revealer and thing to be revealed is stated. The meaning of the word is the thing to be illuminated and the word denotating that meaning is the illuminator.766 
Much as if one were to jump into the middle of a major treatise on post-structuralism 
without any knowledge of who even Lévi-Strauss might have been, though a passage such as 
this is clearly the product of sophisticated thinking that is appropriating and reimagining śāstric 
scholastic categories in subversive ways to new ends, it is often rather difficult to figure what 
these folks are talking about. What seems to be at stake here is a certain kind of 
766Piṅgalāmata: prāg evābhisambandho vaktavyaḥ, sa ca trividhaḥ avatāryāvatārakalakṣaṇasaṃbandhaḥ / vyaṅgyavyañjakalakṣaṇaḥ sambandhaḥ [ucyate], prakāśyaprakāśakalakṣaṇaṃ sambandhaś ceti / tatrāvatāryāvatārakalakṣaṇaḥ sambandha ucyate / ācāryasya ca śāstrasyāvatāryaśāstrasyācāryo ’vatārakam iti / vyaṅgyavyañjakalakṣaṇasambandha ucyate / lakṣaṇasya lakṣyavyaṅgyaṃ / lakṣasya lakṣaṇaṃ vyañjakam iti / prakāśyaprakāśalakṣaṇaḥ sambandha ucyate / śabdasyārthaḥ prakāśyaḥ arthasya śabdaprakāśakamiti / 
793 
phenomenology, a notion of authorship, and associated theory of language. When the ācārya 
speaks, he does not make up his discourse, but in so much as he transmits the Tantra, he is but 
the agent of its descent and incarnation upon the earth. In a similar manner—a vital ontic 
process seems to be implicit in the very act of giving a definition, such that when we define a 
thing, it is not a mere intellectual exercise. Actually, through delineating its defining features, 
the thing as such becomes manifest. Finally, our text seems to conceive the relationship 
between word and meaning, if not as wholly constructed, as by no means cognitively 
transparent. Shoving aside a whole bunch of linguistic philosophy, words apparently appear 
first as lexemes, whose true nature is revealed through the process of recovering its specific 
denotative significance. 
That we are almost thoroughly left adrift at sea by this (depending on your perspective) 
all too brief or interminable outbreak of critical philosophizing is hardly surprising. As the text 
now proceeds to make plain, drawing upon the same passages we explored in earlier in our 
doxographical reflections, the sources available to the scholarly community currently engaged 
in the academic study of the Śākta Tantras represent but an infinitesimal drop of dew in 
comparison to the vast ocean of textuality to which, our text presumes, its intended audience 
would have had some access. 
Now this part, falling within the Brahmayāmala, derived from Durvāsa is Paicika [that which is from the Picumata]. It is of the doctrine of the Sārasvatas and it is proclaimed as Jayadratha’s fifth howling [pheṭkāra]. The Brahmayāmala, comprised of [the pantheon of] Raktā and so forth and [the pantheon of the] lustful dog faced one and so forth [Lampaṭā] is divided sevenfold. 
Which is it among the middle of these seven divisions of the Brahmayāmala? 
This is the Jayadratha; the Jayadratha for its part is a sevenfold sūtra. . . . The Sūtra, the Uttarasūtra and the Śaktisūtra, the one known of as Kriyā, the one called stainless, the gnosis and the Sarvasandoha is the seventh. Which is it in the middle of these classes of the seven types of sūtras? That is the Kriyāsūtra. The Kriyāsūtra also is 
794 
fivefold: the divisions are arcanā, rakṣa, mantra, dhyāna, and kalpārtha. Kriyā is held to be a fivefold process, conjoined with the practice of craft. Which of these is it among the five sorts of Kriyasūtras? It is the sūtra conjoined with the purpose of crafting things.767 
Proceeding down the scale of texts, the Piṅgalāmata now proceeds to specify that it 
emerges from the stream associated with the Jayadrathayāmala. In contradistinction to the 
unrelated organizational schema presented in the Śiraśccheda division of that massive work, 
our scripture further subdivides the Jayadratha’s corpus into seven sūtras, linking itself to a 
sūtra on kriyā, which in turn is said to encompass five additional sub-divisions. Only that last 
of these is dedicated to the procedures for fashioning (kalpārtha). Having presented this 
exhaustive survey of the literature, the Piṅgalāmata regains its train of thought, and introduces 
its intended audience the qualifications for the study or the text and the purpose it serves. 
Otherwise, purified by mantradīkṣā, he is endowed with the state of his own eligibility. Having done the taking refuge of the liṅga, the mantrin knows the liṅga with its characteristics. The liṅga too is a mantra, since by resorting to a liṅga, a multitude [of beings] were able to obtain the state of being gods.768 
Now that we know what we are studying and why, the text resumes exposition of the 
learning process, offering what is one of the few surviving discussions in a revealed scripture 
of the pedagogy involved in both the learning and the teaching of the Tantras.769 We begin 
767Piṅgalāmata: idānī brahmayāmalasyāntapatityāṃśakadaurvāsyaṃ paicikaṃ caiva sāraśvatamataṃ tathā / jayadrathaṃ ca phetkāraṃ pañcamam parikīrttitam // raktādyaṃ laṃpaṭādyañ ca saptadhā brahmayāmalam / eteṣāṃ saptavidhabrahmayāmalānāṃ madhye kimiti / jayadratham etat jayadratham api saptavidhāsutram / sūtram uttarasūtrañ ca śaktisūtraṃ kriyāhvayaṃ // vimalaṃ jñānaṃsamjñaṃ ca sarvasandoha saptamam / eteṣāṃ saptavidhasūtrajātīnāṃ madhye kimiti / kriyāsūtram etat / kriyāsūtram api pañcavidhaḥ vibhāgārcanarakṣāmantradhyānasamanvitaḥ / kalpārthasanniyuktā pañcātra kriyā matā / pañcavidhakriyā- sūtrāṇāṃ madhye kimiti / kalpārthasanniyuktasūtram etat / 768Piṅgalāmata: mantradīkṣā viśuddhas tu svādhikārapadānvitaḥ / kuryāl liṅgāśrayaṃ mantrī jñātvā liṅgaṃ salakṣanaṃ // mantram api liṅgaṃ— yato liṅgāśrayān prāptaṃ devatvaṃ vistarair api / Notice the allusion to the Śivadharma in this passage. 769Rather tellingly, the other important source of this sort is the Caryāpāda of the Mataṅgapārameśvara, and comparative reading of the two sections, which have many commonalities, would be a fruitful endeavor. 
795 
once again with some helpful guidelines directed at the ācārya in training, followed by an 
explanation of appropriate classroom behavior. 
When the connection in the manner just seen [is presented], then after that, there is the commentary by [commenting on] the words and so forth. [The style of exposition] it is of three types, six types, two, or thirty. Or, in whatever way it seems will awaken the listener, in that way, one should start the exposition. [The discourse should be conducted] with repetitions, with lines made of chalk or the like [drawing a diagram], or through the telling of stories. 
The student, having faced the same way, venerates the guru, āgama and gods. Having gone onto the ground, he bows again and again on his knees. After that, with his mind singularly intent on Śiva, he is to listen to the discourse in sequence [line by line]. When a doubt arises, one should ask a question and should say what he understands. 
He should not disrupt the talk, nor should he formulate a cogent argument that is fabricated by his intellect. He should act, O goddess of gods, in accordance with his teacher. If he is not in accordance with the ācārya’s position, there is a great fault, even if he has a greater intellect. When [the talk] is finished, then worship is to be done like previously in sequence.770 
While the educator is granted considerable freedom to use a range of skillful means to 
ensure that the message and content of the scripture he is teaching, and not just the rote letter 
of the text, is transmitted to his students, the same is not true for his disciples. In a world where 
to be a student is to be adhīna, under the dominion of one’s teacher, there is little space for 
progressive approaches to education, and cleverness and innovation are not really rewarded, at 
least within the confines of the classroom. It is only when the teaching session has ended, in 
the context of continued self-study and assimilation, that not only diligence but versatility is 
encouraged on the part of students and accommodations are made for different ability levels. 
Having dismissed the yogapīṭha, having performed the removal of the nirmālya and so forth, one should make the teacher such that one has rested the head at the limit of his 
770Piṅgalāmata: sambandhe ca kṛte pūrvaṃ paścād vyākhyāpadādibhiḥ / trividhāṃ ṣaḍvidhaṃ vāpi dvividhaṃ vā trayodaśaṃ // yathā vā budhyate śrotā tathā vyākhyāṃ samārabhet / varttanaiḥ khaṭikādyaiś ca rekhābhiḥ kathanena vā / śiṣyo ’pi sanmukho bhūtvā pūjya devāgamaṃ guruṃ / jānubhyām avanīṃ gatvā praṇamya ca punaḥ punaḥ // paścāc chivaikacittas tu śrotavyaś cānupūrvaśaḥ / praṣṭavyaṃ saṃśaye jāte yatra budhyati vācayet // pratibandhaṃ na karttavyaṃ codyaṃ vā buddhikalpitam / karttavyaṃ devadeveśi yad ācāryasya saṃmatam / asamamte mahādoṣo yady apy adhikabuddhayaḥ / tatsamāptau punaḥ pūjyaṃ pūrvavac cānupūrvaśaḥ /

feet. Having performed the greeting and the pūjā, one should cause to guru to be forgiving. The invitation and the departure are to be performed with the Bhairava nectar and so forth. Having eaten that, along with the caruka, if he should be become full (sambhṛtaḥ), at the time when the edibles come forth, various types of cooked and boiled things, the listeners should give tāmbūla and karpūra and so forth. The clothes, the gold, gems and everything that they have on hand at the time of the exposition, all that is obtained by the guru, or in accordance with what he approves. . . . 
[After the lecture, depending on the time of the day,] he either should rest, or he can listen, if the guru provides an occasion. Or he could meditate according to his own ability, or, if he is stupid, he can recite. [If a pause in the lecture happens,] having known his own cognitive abilities, he should undertake one of those activities. This is the way one should study the Āgama, right up to the end. . . . 
[Regarding the copying of the text, the guru] should write or have someone write on the full moon or certain days: the first, fourth, ninth or fourteenth day. [On other occasions,] he should recite Purāṇa or Dharmaśāstra or the Śāntyadhyāya [of the Śivadharma]. Otherwise, [on all other occasions] as a habitual duty, one should practice craft (śilpa) and the auspicious fashioning of lines.771 
Assuming the discourse is not interrupted by the appearance of inauspicious signs, such 
as someone vomiting or a snake or monitor lizard crossing near the podium, teaching ends with 
a ritual re-sanctification of the space followed by its dismantling, and the honoring of the guru. 
The community shares the transgressive substances that define inclusion in the tradition with 
each other, marking commensality, and then gifts are distributed to both the guru and the 
listeners are honored with paan. After the discourse ends, however, is when the real learning 
begins. Individually the disciple is encouraged to consult his guru, or to go integrate what he 
has learned through the practice of meditation. It is only in regard to the lowest level of student 
that rote memorization, conducted independent of any understanding of the text, is equated

797with mastery of the material. At times when the discourse has ended, if the occasion is 
auspicious astrologically, the text should be copied, either by the guru or by one of his 
disciples. At times when the teaching of the Tantra is not taking place, the disciple is 
encouraged to listen to his teacher give a discourse—perhaps on one of the Purāṇas, or on the 
Śivadharmaśāstra. Otherwise, he might witness or assist him in performing the Śāntyadhyāya, 
a rite of pacification that forms the sixth chapter of the Śivadharmaśāstra.772 On all other 
occasions, the daily duties assigned to the guru’s students are none other than the practice of 
artisanal crafts well as production of diagrams, including, as we shall see, the sort of schematic 
plans that formed an essential component of the process of designing and constructing a palace 
or temple. 
If the Śivadharmavivaraṇa we have explored in chapter 3 plausibly presents itself as 
an approximation of the sort of discourse one of these ācāryas would be likely to have given 
when speaking on the Dharmaśāstra, assuming he proceeded by commenting directly upon the 
text as opposed to telling stories, the chapter on image construction in the Piṅgalāmata’s 
iconography chapter offers us a tantalizing taste of how Purāṇic knowledge was received 
within Śākta communities and then transmitted among the artisanal and working classes. Such 
Purāṇic narrative extracts are included in the context of discussions of the crafting of images 
of these deities in a range of media, and are thus specifically directed at artisans. One such long 
discussion, for instance, is a long delineation of the iconography of the ten avatāras of Viṣṇu. 
This particular extract is fascinating in that it unsettles our assumptions about how thoroughly

798 
the “universal” cultural permeation of Purāṇic narrative as universal hegemonic 
“Brāhmaṇical” knowledge might have been integrated into artisan communities.773 
For instance, the goddess Piṅgalā—breaking a litany of dhyānas designed to aid in the 
crafting of images of various different deities, supernatural beings, and narrative scenes, 
standing in as she so often does for the novice artisan just beginning to wrap his mind around 
the technical dimensions inherent in his professional responsibilities—suddenly turns to 
Bhairava and makes a simple request. Admitting she does not know much of anything about 
Vaiṣṇava tradition, she asks her lord to offer a crash course in its mythology. “Piṅgalā said: 
For what purpose is Viṣṇu tenfold, and tell me how [the incarnations] are ranked?”774 In 
response, Bhairava presents us with a rambling series of shaggy dog stories that offer rather 
unexpected insights into the medieval sociology of knowledge. Here, for example is how our 
text represents Viṣṇu when he incarnates as the last two avatāras: the Buddha Siddhārtha 
Gautama and Kalkī, as well as the mysterious figure of Mādhava. 
The Buddha is to be made seated in a lotus posture, in a samādhi posture such that his hands stretch downward. He has long ears. He is peaceful. He has a loin cloth and wears the robe of a Buddhist monk. His heart is joined with a gem, and his eyes are absorbed in [the tip of] his nose. His hand and his feet are marked with lotuses and his face has the glimmer of a smile. His true nature (svarūpa) is the essence of consciousness (citsvabhāva). His mind is singularly fixed on compassion. His face is very beautiful. He resembles a fresh blooming lotus. 
Kalkī has a ferocious nature, of the sort that is evident in the body of a foreigner. He has a quiver yoked on his back and in his hand is a bow with arrows. Mādhava has the 
773It should be noted that the textual work on the iconography section of the Piṅgalāmata is at a much more preliminary stage than with other portions of the work discussed in this chapter and thus all interpretations such be taken as contingent on an eventual consultation of confirmation of the readings offered in the unused sources. It also makes use of distinct manuscript evidence. Succinctly, while the generally superior reading offered by the British Library’s Nepalese manuscript have yet to inform the readings chosen, for this section we have additional testimonials from a published transcript of a Nāgarī manuscript preserved in Calcutta that seems in place to offer some distinct and not merely corrupt readings. As the British library manuscript, while offering better grammatical readings and preserving older terms of art virtually never adds additional verses nor does it restructure or resequence material, the choppiness and disjointed nature of the narratives presented is likely to be original. 774Piṅgalāmata: kimarthaṃ daśadhā viṣṇuḥ parāparaḥ kathaṃ vada / 
799 
form of a Brāhmaṇa because he is born from a Brāhmaṇa family. One should fashion supreme Viṣṇu on top of his head and he should be made having a peaceful form.775 
Typically, of course, the Vaiṣṇava treatment of the Buddha entails recasting him as 
duplicitous figure who comes down into the world to delude men with false teachings, whereas 
our text proposes a thoroughly positive vision of the Buddha. But perhaps even more strikingly, 
the theology this extract invokes is decidedly eccentric. Outside of the “other-emptiness” 
discourse of the thirteenth century Tibetan polymath Dölpopa Shérap Gyeltsen, Buddhists 
simply do not talk about the Buddha as having an essential nature (svarūpa) let alone being 
made of consciousness (citsvabhāva) in a manner that is conceptually commensurate with 
Śākta Śaiva non-dual theology. If the Buddha is at once reimagined as benign and Bhairava 
Siddhānta curious, Kalkī, who is supposed to come at end the age, retains his martial nature 
but loses his horse and his iconic sword. In each of these cases, even just in articulating how 
to craft these figures, something essential about their nature and purpose has been 
misconstrued. As for the insertion of Mādhava, born in a Brāhmaṇa body, a detail usually 
assigned to Kalkī, at the very end of the list, one would almost be inclined to think that 
something has gone wrong with the textual transmission. The passages that follow, however, 
demonstrate clearly that the problem here is not primarily philological in nature. 
Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Rudra are the three gods. The Lord having resorted to Meru, they abide there, at the end of cosmic egg. On the part of both of them, Īśvara is their maker. But, for the sake of establishing the age, Brahmā indeed is the lord of the terrestrial world. Viṣṇu is the protector of the world. 
When [the world] was submerged all about in a single terrible ocean, then, having taken on the form of a fish for the sake of play, he went there, for, the great sage Mārkaṇḍa had fallen in—within the oscillating play of the waves [where] there was no refuge. 
775Piṅgalāmata: buddhaḥ padmāsanaḥ kāryo hastottānasamādhinā / pralambaśravaṇaḥ saumyaḥ kakṣāvāsas tu cīvaraḥ // maṇiyugghṛdayaṃ tasya nāsālīnas tu cakṣuṣā / hastau pādau ca padmāṅkau kiñcit prahasitānanaḥ // svarūpaś citsvabhāvas tu karuṇaikagato manaḥ / mukhaṃ cātīvaramyaṃ tu sadyakamalasannibhaṃ // kalkī ca karkaśo bhāvo yathā mlecchavapuḥ sthitaḥ / tūṇī ca pṛṣṭhato yuktaḥ kare vai saśaraṃ dhanuḥ // brāhmaṇīkulasaṃbhūto viprarūpī ca mādhavaḥ / śirorddhve ca paro viṣṇuḥ śāntarūpaṃ prakalpayet // 
800 
The two of their gazes came together and they had mutual knowledge of each other. Then, for the sake of the earth, the great god was spoken to by Mārkaṇḍa. He was then informed that Viṣṇu had come in the form of a turtle. Quickly the turtle descended to where the earth itself was. Having abandoned her own form, the Earth, along with Śrī, took on the form of a woman. They went to where the overlord of the Kusmāṇḍas was established along with the instruments of the sacrifice. Having seen them, then the turtle assumed the form of Vārāha. . . . Then, the goddess Śriyā became thrilled and became established on his chest. Then, the earth bowed down to the feet and took refuge. . . . Having made the seven continents, the oceans with mountains, forests, and groves and Meru and the pole star, the worlds were established [by you] in a differentiated way. . . . In the beginning of the kṛta age, at the juncture of the age, on the surface of the earth along with the lord, the king was Hiraṇyakaśipu, the great demon. Having seen he was not killable, he [Viṣṇu] created a lion form. And his grandson was named Bali who was a renunciate who was skilled in dharma. For the sake of binding him, Viṣṇu assumed the state of being a dwarf.776 
It is difficult to decide what dimension of this discussion is more surprising. Is it that it 
provides inconvertible evidence that, as late as the eighth-ninth century, artisan communities 
would otherwise have so little exposure to the systems of meaning that lie behind a good 
portion of the images that they sculpt that it was decided that the relevant materials needed to 
be integrated into the curriculum? Or, is it more fitting that we are taken aback by the subpar 
quality of the lesson that ensues, which conveys in no uncertain terms that this interpretative 
community was as thoroughly confused about “Hindu” mythology as any early modern Jesuit? 
Bhairava may be the mad lord of the universe, but, if this small sampling is any indication, he

is an abysmal storyteller. Not only is he thoroughly ignorant of the material, but more 
fundamentally, he is at an utter loss at handling such basic dimensions of a narrative as 
emphasizing plot points, presenting a beginning, middle, and end, and generally, avoiding the 
sloppy omission of key details. A single example, focusing mostly on how badly Bhairava 
bungles his presentation of the iconic narrative of Viṣṇu as the man lion, will prove most 
instructive. 
In the passage we have been exploring, Bhairava has just finished relating the end of 
the story of the churning of the ocean and emergence of the goddess Śrī. While, in typical 
Purāṇic mythology, Śrī emerges along with the kālakūṭa poison, the nectar of immortality, and 
an indeterminate number of magical animals, when the ocean is being churned, a process that 
requires the support of the turtle avatāra, here we find she is just there, floating under the 
ocean. When Viṣṇu sees fortune floating there in human form, our protagonist behaves like 
any red-blooded male: he turns into a pig. Śrī is absorbed into his chest, and then, the boar 
incarnation creates the continents and gives shape to the present arrangement of our material 
world. An indeterminate amount of time passes. Next thing we know, post-boar installation, 
the demon Hiraṇyakaśipu has conquered the newly emergent earth. 
Though you would know nothing of this from our text, in virtually every other version 
of the story this savvy demon operator performed tremendous austerities with such single 
minded and ferocious focus that the force of his tapas threatened to incinerate the earth. To 
prevent this from happening, Brahmā descends and offers the demon a boon, in response to 
which Hiraṇyakaśipu wishes that he may not be killed—or so the simple version of the tale 
usually goes: “by neither man nor beast, at day or night, neither inside the house nor outside 
the house, nor upon the earth or in the sky.” Thinking himself invincible, Hiraṇyakaśipu 
802 
conquers the earth, and so the gods beseech Viṣṇu to descend from the heavens and rescue 
them. Instead of intervening directly, however, Viṣṇu first arranges things so that 
Hiraṇyakaśipu sires a son, Prahlāda, who is a staunch adherent believer in the worship of 
Viṣṇu. Depending on just how pointedly an effusive bhakti theology is a part of the tradition 
doing the telling, for, as we will see in chapter 9 in some early Vaiṣṇava sources 
Hiraṇyakaśipu’s son is depicted not as an open-hearted devotee but rather as the meticulous 
executor of the ritual injunctions that Viṣṇu teaches, Hiraṇyakaśipu responds to having such a 
traitor in his family with varying degrees of violence and rage. The basic denouement of the 
story, however, is both consistent and exceptionally memorable. When Hiraṇyakaśipu reviles 
Viṣṇu at twilight, a terrible creature that is half man and half lion emerges from a pillar in his 
palace. Snatching up the demon in its paws, it carries him to the threshold of the palace. Placing 
the demon on its lap, it proceeds to eviscerate him. And so Hiraṇyakaśipu—who thought 
himself unkillable—is slain by something that is neither man nor beast, neither inside the house 
or outside of the house, at the juncture between day and night, while raised up in the air so he 
touches neither the earth nor the sky. Succinctly, the whole point of the story of the man-lion 
(Nṛsiṃha) incarnation is precisely the clever loophole through which god subverts our 
expectations and saves the world. 
In the Piṅgalāmata, not only is the audience provided none of this essential context for 
making sense of the story, but Bhairava blows the punch line. In this story, Viṣṇu notices that 
Hiraṇyakaśipu, the great demon (mahāsura) is unkillable (avadhyaka) and in response he 
emanates (sṛṣṭavān) in the form not of a man-lion, but just a plain old lion (siṃharūpa). The 
story then ends abruptly, as we are told that Hiraṇyakaśipu’s grandson was named Bali. 
Nothing else happens. In isolation, the story does not just violate the logic of the source 
803 
material, but it presents no systematicities of its own, just a stray collection of observations 
bearing no obvious logical connection even to each other, What happens to the unkillable 
demon? Since the next detail on offer is about his grandson, presumably—he lives a long and 
happy life? Furthermore, why exactly did Viṣṇu become a lion? What did he do as a lion? Did 
demon and lion ever even interact? Why, quite frankly, was this story even told in the first 
place? 
To be fair to Bhairava, elsewhere in the same chapter, in the context of the 
Piṅgalāmata’s presentation of Nṛsiṃha’s iconography, it is made evident that he has in his 
possession additional information about how the tale ends. Thus, the text prepares the sculptor 
for the task of making mūrtis of Narasiṃha, in the following manner: 
His whole body has the form of Bhairava. It should be fashioned as if it were well fed. His two hands are round and bear a club and a cakra. Hiraṇyakaśipu is on his chest and he is being eviscerated by the two nails. A stream of blood flows to the ground and the cages that are his arms hang down. His hands like knives hang down, in a similar manner, with the head [of the asura] hanging at his foot; at his knees there are demons as if dead. He is called Narasiṃha.777 
What Bhairava is lacking is not information, then, but knowledge. It seems he, or at 
least the interpretive community to which he has transmitted his text, have no means of 
accessing an “insider’s” perspective about what we imagine to represent the standard “Hindu” 
mythological currents that are seen as forming a cultural lingua franca. For this reason, they 
lack the tools to differentiate between what “matters” in the realm of Purāṇic thought and what 
are merely incidental surface features in the stories. In light of the terms of Hiraṇyakaśipu’s 
boon being that he cannot be slain by man nor beast, emplotting a version of the Narasiṃha 
myth in which god descends in the form of a lion—a beast if ever there was one—offers a clear 
777Piṅgalāmata: sarvāṅgo bhairavākāraṃ puṣṭatvena prakalpayet / karau tau kintu vṛttābhau gadācakradharau tathā // hiraṇyakaśipur vakṣe dvayor nakhavidāritau / raktadhārā sravaty adhaḥ pralambabhujapañjarau // churikāhastalambena pādalambaśiras tathā / jānuke mṛtavad daityā nārasiṃhas tato ’cyate // 
804 
demonstration that our text does not know what this story is “about.” That, with the exception 
of the accounts of Rāma of the Rāghavas and Rāma of the axe, all the rest of these stories 
display not the slightest awareness that it is the conquest of the world by otherwise unstoppable 
demons or other evil forces that typically serves as the catalyst for Viṣṇu’s descent into the 
world and that this incarnation process entails the slaying of said demons—a system of values 
already evident in the third to fourth century CE Harivaṃśa—makes it plain that our artisans 
and their gurus do not have even a cursory grasp of a typical Vaiṣṇava worldview. 
To be crystal clear, it is not that we are taking Bhairava to task for not knowing the 
“right” versions of what we now think of as canonical myths, for, of course, the transmutation 
of mythological narrative into a myriad of permutations is as integral a feature of “Hindu” 
mythology as the cherished stories themselves. To draw out just a few examples, the Vāyu 
Purāṇa, one of the oldest of our sources and an emphatically Śaiva one at that, treats Viṣṇu as 
Śiva’s errand boy, offers no canon of incarnations, and only invests itself in retelling the stories 
of how the boar rescued the world, on the one hand, and how Kṛṣṇa Vāsudeva descended to 
end the line of the Vṛṣṇīs on the other. As spoken by the fish to Manu, the initial most pressing 
matter for the Matsya Purāṇa is to explain, in sequence, how Bhāgavan Viṣṇu assumed the 
form of a fish, and why did the bull bannered lord take on the guise of a skull carrier?778 If, to 
banalize Lévi-Strauss, “myths are good to think with,” the Piṅgalāmata transgresses not in 
failing to get these stories “correct” but because it does almost nothing of substance with them. 
It does not even attempt a radical reinvention of the materials to reconcile them with its own 
expressed values. Instead, poor Piṅgalā’s sincere simple question is answered with a 
presentation of scattered and shattered second-hand impressions of other people’s stories. 
778Matsya Purāṇa 1.7–8: kasmāc ca bhagavān viṣṇur mastyarūpatvam āśritaḥ / bhairavatvaṃ bhavasyāpi purāritvaṃ ca kena hi / kasya hetoḥ kapālitvaṃ jagāma vrṣabhadhavajaḥ // 
805 
What does this tell us about the nature of knowledge and the transmission of knowledge 
in medieval India? We have just examined in some detail two case studies—drawn from the 
exact same text—that discuss how the ācārya is to teach his community. In the first account, 
the Bhairavācārya is introduced as a person of great erudition who has digested an enormous 
canon of textual resources, most of which are no longer available to us, which he then skillfully 
transmits to his community using a variety of teaching strategies. As we have seen, what the 
text prescribes is not a rote transmission through memorization, but rather a mode of teaching 
that begins by imparting to the students a meta-reflexivity about how texts work that is offered, 
at least to the most promising pupils, as tools for thinking with. These emic hermeneutics not 
only incorporate scholastic concepts, such as the anubandhacatuṣṭaya, that are mainstays of 
high Sanskrit learning, but through appropriating and reinventing technical terms of art like 
vyañjana and vyañjaka. Notwithstanding that our text is written in an abominably nonstandard 
Sanskrit, it displays the type of significant conversance in scholastic modes of reading and 
reasoning that would be necessary for coherent innovative adaptation. The Piṅgalāmata, in 
other words, envisions the ācārya who will teach it to be the sort of the person who, when 
confronted with the passing allusion in its opening verses to one of the speakers of the text 
being the one who made well-known the definitions of the meters (chandālakṣaṇa), will 
recognize the subtle play on words being suggested between the bird-headed Piṅgalā of the 
cremation grounds and Piṅgala, the founding father of the tradition of Sanskrit metrics 
(chandaḥśāstra), offering perhaps in response an amused chuckle. In other words, these are 
hardly ignorant people. How is it, then, that they seem utterly at sea when confronted by some 
simple stories, of the sort that would prominently feature in most introductions to Indian 
religions addressed to the vaguely curious undergraduate? 
806 
Perhaps the most compelling explanation is not only that such stories do not yet form 
a part of the canon of common knowledge across the lines of geography, religious 
commitment, varṇa, and caste, but more fundamentally, they are not even possible objects of 
knowledge. A Bhairavācārya may well have been learned in “secular” śāstra and intellectually 
and professionally ambitious, but it is not like he could just go a bookstore and purchase a 
collection of Purāṇas in manuscript. Just as we saw in regard to the Bhairavāgama, where, 
before anything at all could be taught, the makeup of the audience had to be scrutinized in 
order to determine that everyone had adhikāra, for if they did, not the lesson would be 
cancelled, the imparting of Vaiṣṇava Purāṇa would have been mediated through particular 
bodies embedded in specific social settings. As the Viṣṇudharma, the Śivadharmaśāstra’s 
perhaps slightly younger twin, would have it, socialization into its codes of conducts was 
predicated not on bhakti but adopting and maintaining śuddha social and dietary habits, 
including observing caste norms. As we saw in chapter 3, commensality among those who 
belong to the jāti of Bhairava is defined by the sharing the vīradravya, which contains, at the 
very least, animal meat, liquor, and fish. The two modes of commensality thus represent 
intrinsically non-overlapping magesteria. As we will see, down into the early thirteenth 
century, śilpins and ācāryas hailing from the Bhairava Siddhānta are frequently contracted to 
build the temples, maṭhas, palaces, and residences occupied by Vaiṣṇavas—even Śrīvaiṣṇavas, 
a detail which explains the otherwise peculiar recurrence of the sixty-four Bhairavas and, 
surreptitiously, their yoginīs, even at the Hoysala temple at Belur. In other words, quotidian 
professional exchanges between communities are part and parcel of the social order. The 
exchange of community-specific knowledge, on the other hand, appears to be verboten. One 
might indeed say that the worldview of our artisans and that of other communities shared little 
807common ground—for not only metaphorically, but quite literally, these people inhabited 
different worlds. 
Charity Starts at Homa: Radical Nondualism, Philanthropy, and the Making of a Śākta 
World 
Jan Brouwer’s Makers of the World: Caste, Craft and Mind of South Indian Artisans is not 
only unquestionably the single most important work yet written on the artisan castes of the 
Deccan, in all likelihood it will remain in perpetuity the definitive work on the subject.779 
Brouwer’s work is the product of three years of intensive fieldwork—during which its author 
crossed the length and breadth of Karnataka on his trusty motorcycle—complemented by the 
study of rare and unpublished Kannada language sources as well as its author’s considerable 
command over the technicalities of design and engineering that inform the actual process of 
artisanal craft. In part, the indispensable nature of this remarkable but neglected work of 
scholarship stems from the fact that in the time that has passed since its composition, the life- 
worlds of the various communities of Karnataka’s otherwise unstudied artisan castes have 
largely been absorbed into a more general milieu of middle class twenty-first-century Hindu 
identity, and within a generation, most of the knowledge Brouwer’s text preserves may well 
have vanished on the ground. At the same time, however, Makers of the World is also the rare 
work of anthropology that reads out from its archive observations and hypothesis about the 
values and historical circumstances that form the conditions of possibility for what it has found 
in situ, highlighting key elements and proposing hypotheses that are then subsequently 
confirmed by the discovery of unpublished sources of which it could not possibly be aware. In

808 
short, though very much a work of structural anthropology of the sort that prevailed in the 
1980s, it is a careful and exemplary piece of scholarship. 
In its ninth chapter, “The Magnetic fort,” Brouwer documents and analyzes an “oral 
tradition of the Visvakarmas. . . distinguished by the fact that it is known to their bards as well 
as laymen”780 that exists in many iterations among all of the different subcastes. Among these 
discrepancies, however, the tale sets out to convey a unified message, for it speaks of a golden 
age where the Viśvakarmans lived in “a well-protected place” in “a fort” which they built 
themselves. In the version told by the Konnurpanta sub-caste, for example: 
There were automatic gates to the fort, which opened at sunrise and closed at sunset. All the Visvakarmas in the fort were very religious and lived a pure life. It was a happy kingdom of only Visvakarmas. These were a devoted people who began their work only after their morning prayer and meditation. These prosperous Visvakarmas were engaged in five crafts: blacksmithy, carpentry, coppersmithy, sculpture, and goldsmithy. In the daytime, when the gates were open, they went out to deliver their products and returned before sunset. Nobody else was allowed inside the fort. The Visvakarmans had not only a great scientific, but also religious knowledge. . . . Thus they enjoyed high esteem.781 
In his analysis of the many related variants on this story, whose telling and tragic 
denouement we will return to as the chapter comes to a close, Brouwer draws out a number of 
themes that will prove prescient for our analysis. 
Thus, all the Visvakarmas lived inside the well-protected fort, isolated from the world. With their Vedic [sic] knowledge, they were engaged in prayer and meditation. They had thus more or less renounced the world. Their independence of the world can also be deduced from the statement that the fort was a ‘happy kingdom. . .’ By placing themselves inside the fort, the Visvakarmas withdrew from the world ‘of rights and shares.’ This, and the emphasis on learning and teaching the Vedas, strengthen their claim to the Brahman status. . . . 
At the beginning of the story, we are informed that the delivery of the products took place in the daytime. This suggests they were manufactured at night behind the closed doors of the fort. This secrecy could have a deeper meaning, as it is a form of isolation and perhaps served the purpose of isolating the source of magic. In fact, the secrecy

and the manufacturing process are clearly linked here. From interviews with smiths, I learnt that the smelting of iron-ore took place formerly at night. . . . In the blacksmiths’ view, the furnace [in which this smelting takes place] is a manifestation of the goddess Kali. The goldsmiths even call the furnace the womb of Kali. . . . 
The story outlines the elements of the ideal state in which the Visvakarmas were at once the kings (‘kingdom of only Visvakarmas’) and the Brahmans. . . while the fortress itself indicates a manifestation of the goddess.782 
As close reading of the chapters of the Piṅgalāmata on the construction of cities and 
the designing of houses will soon make plain, the Viśvakarman mythology documented by 
Brouwer seems to preserve a rather acute historical memory pertaining to the actual social 
circumstances of the Deccan’s artisan communities during the early medieval period. The 
secondary literature on Śilpaśāstra has typically taken the terse lack of specificity about the 
real-world application pratiṣṭhā discourse, obsessively devoted to context-free systems of 
measurements, as evidence that this is simply an imagined scholastic exercise only tangentially 
connected to lived artisanal realities. For this reason, it is essential to note that the Piṅgalāmata 
overflows with hyper-particularized detail for adapting its structures to align with a variety of 
real-world situations as well as extensive considerations of the phenomenological experiences 
of different social agents of participating in the social functions that coincide with acts of 
installation. Succinctly, the Piṅgalāmata makes vividly present for us how at places like 
Ramling Mudgal, entire communities of pañcakārukas came of age and carried out their craft 
in their own separate cities, living out their lives under the direction of their Śākta caste gurus 
and interacting with other social communities only in the context of receiving or delivering 
commissions. As the Piṅgalāmata states: 
782Brouwer, The Makers of the World, 218–221. 
810 
I will explain the city of the cumbakas,783 which should be made in the same manner as for a king, O Surasundarī, and the measurement and the floor plan of a palace. It should be known that in the same way you make the walls for a prākāra, you should fashion walls for a city (pura). . . . And again, just like that, there is the fashioning of a whole lot of wall all around it. . . . 
This is called the city of Śiva. It adheres to the conventions of the nandikāvarta [template]. O one with a beautiful lap, it belongs to the cumbaka and the ones seeking bhoga and mokṣa. It is auspicious and has a radiant state. It is eternal, delights the mind, and is auspicious. It is a permanent establishment that is completely equipped with all resources, of which particular procedures are enjoined [to be carried out according to its bylaws]. It is the city of Śiva, without fault, proceeded from the guru. . . . 
A discerning person does this [establishes a śivapura] according to his wealth and according to the conventions of time and place. The second type of nandikāvarta, known to pertain to the cumbaka, is said to be a divine, radiant city. It is said to belong, O one with a beautiful lap, to the one who had been authorized by the king and is ornamented by sovereignty.784 
The cumbaka in this passage is the Śākta ācārya who oversees the śilpins.785 His walled 
city (pura), a place dedicated to the pursuit of both liberation and enjoyment, has a layout, 
which adjusted to scale and population, is directly analogous to that of the capital of a king. In 
accordance with the norms of Vāstuśāstra, in medieval India, urban planning is not merely a 
matter of convenience but is largely determined by geomantic and astrological concerns, as 
there is a strong belief that the success of failure of specific human activities are determined 
by spatial arrangement. For this reason, before construction even begins, the city is plotted 
onto a prastāra grid and institutions are distributed into their proper quadrants. Just to survey 
783Though the significance of the appellation is unclear, the word cumbaka quite literally means “the kisser.” It is an exceptionally archaic term for an adept in Tantric and pre-Tantric systems, appearing for example in the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā. 784Piṅgalāmata: cumbakasya puraṃ vakṣye yathānṛpakṛtam bhavet / prāsādasya tu yan mānaṃ vistaraṃ surasundari // prākārabhittivat jñeyo purabhittiprakalpanā /. . . . punas tadvat tathā bhūyaḥ samantāt parikalpanā . . . . śivapuro ’yaṃ samākhyātā nandikāvartalakṣaṇaḥ / cumbakasya varārohe bhogamokṣārthinasya tu // śivaṃ śobhanabhāvaṃ ca manohaṃ śāśvataṃ śubhaṃ / sthiraṃ cāvyayasaṃpūrṇaṃ paryāyo yasya coditaḥ // śivasya vā puraṃ caiva na doṣaṃ gurupūrvakaṃ. . . . vittānurūpataḥ prājño deśakālānurūpataḥ / dvitīyaṃ nandikāvartaṃ cumbakasya prakīrtitaḥ // narendrādhikṛtasyaiva aiśvaryālaṃkṛtasya ca / kathitaṃ tu varārohe puraṃ divyaṃ suśobhanaṃ / 785The analysis that follows, for reasons of space and to reduce the tedium, summarizes some key dimensions of the sector-by-sector delineation of the contents different types of śivapuras as presented in the passages elided from the above translation.

a few examples of what sort of functions are being accommodated, wealth is to be stored in 
the domain of īśa, musical instruments in the parjanaya domain, the office that issues 
confirmations of who has won a legal decision is appropriately placed in the region of victory, 
while the university (ghaṭikāśraya), and the house of dance (nṛtyaśāla) are to either be placed 
in the ūrdhva direction or directly adjacent to the central temple at the end of the maṇḍapa. 
Bathrooms for people visiting the pura are to be found in the realm of the ancestors, not far 
from the bathing house and the dormitories for women. There is a public hospital, separate 
travelers’ houses and dining halls for lay people and ascetics, and an auditorium set aside for 
debates and performances of kāvya and nāṭaka. Our text even discusses the spatial arrangement 
where the different centers of power within the pura were to have been located. Thus, while 
the councils of the mahājanapadas are always to be housed in the north, and the 
dharmādhikaraṇas, who produce legal decisions (vyavahāranirūpaṇa) and sarvādhikaraṇas 
who issue orders on behalf of the ācārya are to stay in the domain of the sun, there is 
considerably more flexibility in the placement of the maṭha. This, our text tells us, is the ritual 
center of the śivapura. It is not only where the ācārya himself sleeps but also the space where 
iṣṭi, āhnika, japa, meditation and yoga are to be practiced and where the vīras are to gather for 
the eating of the things to be eaten and drunk by vīras. In the direction of the moon, rather 
enigmatically, we are told, in a lovely courtyard, concealed behind own exterior wall, the 
“secret thing”—allegedly the most important element of the city—is to be installed. While this 
is the general template for creating a śivapura with a diverse internal population, the 
Piṅgalāmata in passing seems to suggest that one could craft a number of variations on this 
basic template. For example, while ideally the secret space in the place of the moon should 
812 
have a structure made of pure stone, if that is not possible, wood, clay, or even brambles and 
thatched grass can serve as substitute building materials.786 
Apart from managing institutional space, our Śākta śilpa texts also engage in a bit of 
biopolitics. In a large-scale śivapura, the śilpins, who as lay Tantric practitioners are classified 
among those who seek bhoga and mokṣa, are assigned their own region, not far from the space 
set aside for the performance of rites of pacification, in an area that, if any are present in the 
community, shares a neighborhood boundary with Brāhmaṇas. The śilpin subset called 
kārukas, in contrast, abide in the direction of fire, where they are grouped alongside wood 
workers and iron smiths. Wage laborers and plowmen are consigned to the inauspicious 
regions of yama and nairṛtya. A similar sort of hierarchy among the disciples also governs the 
allotment of personal space and privilege. In the “common kind” of nandikāvarta where the 
cumbaka and so forth reside, residents are assigned a śālā or home on the basis of their status, 
in which they are to reside as well as perform their sādhana (sādhanahetukaṃ). The śālā of 
the ācārya has four rooms; that of a sādhaka,787 in whose ranks some artisans seem to have 
been included, has three; the putraka disciple has a two-room home, and the samayin initiate 
has a single room house. Though the text is somewhat obscure, either metaphorically or quite 
literally, the differentiated function of both residences and buildings for the carrying out of 
professional activities is said to be marked by banners and sigils; for instance, the working 
space of the mantra-knowers and their assistants, the senior disciples of the ācārya, are to be 
marked by the sigil śrī while the putraka’s space bears an image of a lion and a bull. 
786Some of these may be conditioned by caste or demographic. So, for example, if the city is primarily housing potters (kulālakṛtapaṭṭam), one can dispense with building a staircase down to the ghāṭs and a designated large scale well, while a city set aside for Jain renunciates (arhaṭapadapaṭṭam) requires a staircase but can make do with a miniature well. In other circumstances, alternatives are proposed on the basis of the resources available to the builder. 787 The sādhaka house, called hiraṇyāvartaka and having three rooms, are to the north of the temple and thus fall in the same general area as those of the śilpins. 
813 
Succinctly, a śivapura is not only a sovereign place set apart from the normal rhythms 
of life of a regular village, wherein crafting in effect became an act of worship, but it is also a 
space that continues to be organized according to the juridico-theological vision of the radical 
differentiation of domains where disparate orders of values are accommodated in adjacent but 
distinctive spaces. As we have seen throughout our study, while such a framework can indeed 
accommodate caste norms, it is not itself reducible to caste as a conceptual frame. In other 
words, the institution our text calls the śivapura is identical with that the types of akṣaya or 
sarvamānya grants bestowed on Śaiva and Śākta-Śaiva ācāryas by kings and other political 
actors that formed the social foundation of the medieval Deccan, one variation of which 
primarily housed ślipins. 
In our inscriptional records, the founding of this sort of an institution is reduced to a 
stock formula. The issuing of the grant by the secular authority to the ācārya, who receives the 
rights on behalf of his community to sovereign oversight over the space in perpetuity, including 
the right to levy taxes and freedom from the military and financial power of the kingdom, is 
memorialized by the ritualized washing of the teacher’s feet. In contradistinction, in its chapter 
on pratiṣṭhā, in representing the originary moments of a sacred site, the Piṅgalāmata 
parochializes what we have hitherto perceived as the self-evident focus of such an event. As 
our perspective shifts away from the juridical act and its implications for the evidentiary record, 
the transfer of the deed marked by the washing of the feet is treated as a mere denouement to 
the festival, addressed in a handful of verses. Instead, we are offered an unusually detailed and 
multifaceted presentation of the festivities providing the ritual framework within which the 
transfer of power would have taken place. 
814 
As we shall see, these festivals structure space and experience so as to perpetuate both 
the institution of the five day festival itself as well all the instantiation of a specifically Śākta 
esoteric sensibility. Lasting a minimum of five day, the occurrences that would have 
surrounded the transfer of deed are addressed in both esoteric and pragmatic terms. In doing 
so, our text incorporates the diverse perspectives and limited horizons of a range of ritual actors 
as well as observers who would have had greater and lesser and degrees of knowledge about 
the range of activities constitutive of the proceedings. It is well worth our time to offer a 
particularly close reading of this chapter of the Piṅgalāmata, for not only are the discussions 
contained therein particularly rich in their own right, but having a strong command over this 
material will prove vital to our investigations in chapter 9 of how the reimagining of pratiṣṭhā 
and acts of philanthropy promulgated by the Seuṇa Yādava court and entextualized in the 
Caturvargacintāmaṇi of its chief minister, the Brāhmaṇa polymath Hemādri, deliberately 
subverts and dismantles nearly every practical and theological dimension of this longstanding 
social institution. Given the length and technical nature of the Piṅgalāmata’s discussion of 
pratiṣṭhā, it is perhaps preferrable that we begin by with a distillation of some of its key aspects 
prior to turning to the text. 
The Piṅgalāmata demonstrates that the founding of an akṣayavṛtti that contains a ritual 
center is marked by a special kind of public festival. This involves the participation of ritual 
specialists from within the community, with the ācārya, his key disciples, and the various 
classes of artisans in particular playing a featured role, including the sponsor and his extended 
family and social network, Vedic ritualists working on spec, musicians from outside the 
community, and last, but not least, a public who are the primary beneficiaries of staged reveries 
and acts of mass philanthropy. As we will soon see in some detail, each of these types of agents, 
815 
even as they share space, have very different understandings of what is going on in any given 
moment. From the perspective of the artisans and their guru, the primary focus of the festival is 
the production, preparation, and ritual installation of the iconic and aniconic focuses of worship 
that will take residence in the new sacred city.788 It is only when the deities have moved into 
their new homes and become settled that sovereignty can be transferred from political actors 
to religious authorities. For the artisans, their festival obligations entail at once the skillful 
execution of a series of highly precise and technical stages in the artisanal process and the 
performance of a series of ritual duties—many of them involving fire oblations—as intricate 
as any Śrauta sacrifice.789 As the Piṅgalāmata demonstrates quite candidly, what makes 
possible all of these procedures is nothing other than practical training in the mechanics of 
Śākta Tantric meditative praxis and the internalization of the quintessentially Śākta worldview, 
namely, that everything in existence is equally pervaded by divine presence in the form the 
788As Anna Ślączka observes in the introduction to her meticulous study of the perhaps twelfth-century Vaiṣṇava Pratiṣṭhā text, the Kāśyapaśilpa, “With the exception of Kramrisch (1946), whose interpretations should be treated with caution (see, for example, Chapter 6 note 12) there has never been an attempt to study the construction rituals as a whole and to explain their function and meaning.” Anna Ślączka, Temple Consecration Rituals in Ancient India: Text and Archaeology (Leiden: Brill, 2007), 1. Besides Ślączka’s work, the anthology István Keul, ed., Consecration Rituals in South Asia (Leiden: Brill, 2017), while not yet comprehensive, brings together for the first time treatments of different aspects of the ritual process drawn from a wide range of religious traditions, with the noticeable exception of the classical Śākta Tantra, which, as we have seen, were the dominant tradition throughout most of the Deccan. The situation with regards to temple festivals is somewhat better, as we have, for example, Richard Davis’s fine annotated translation of the Mahotsavavidhi, likely erroneously ascribed to Aghoraśiva, which, while not focused on pratiṣṭhā festivals in particular shares many features with the genre, Hélène Brunner-Lachaux’s heavily annotated French translation of volume 4 of Somaśambhu’s eleventh-century Karmakāṇḍakramāvalī, as well as critical editions of the likely early modern Sūkṣmāgama. Here again, the traditions discussed are exclusively those of Śaiva Siddhānta, which in the region under discussion represented a social force with circumscribed influence and comparatively negligible impact on material culture. See Richard Davis, trans., A Priest's Guide for the Great Festival Aghorasiva’s Mahotsavavidhi (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010); Brunner-Lachaux, Hélène, ed. and trans., Somaśambhupaddhati, 4 vols. (Pondicherry: Institut Français de Pondichéry, 1963–1998). 789Indeed, an examination of Marco Geslani’s Rites of the God-King read in relation to the Tantric literature on pratiṣṭhā makes evident what Gelsani has yet to notice, namely, that much of the ritual repertoire of the pratiṣṭhāpanācārya of the early medieval world is inherited directly from Atharvan śānti ritual. Marko Geslani, Rites of the God-King: Śānti and Ritual Change in Early Hinduism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2018).

power that is the goddess and for this reason no thing or person can be considered intrinsically 
impure. Counterintuitively, at the same time that this doctrinal position justifies clandestine 
nocturnal practices on the part of artisans, guru, and any other initiates present, the 
consumption of the vīradravya as a mark of commensality, and the concealed performance 
during public events of genuinely transgressive Śākta rites, about which the general public 
remains blissfully ignorant, it is these very same values that form the conditions of possibility 
for acts of mass charity directed especially at the most humble and afflicted within society at 
large, without any concern for the maintenance of ritual purity. 
For ordinary participants, besides some general sense of encountering embodied 
instantiations of sacred power that might convey favor or blessings, the central point of interest 
in the installation of a sacred icon and the establishment of a new ritual complex is that such 
institutions, particularly those of a Śākta-Śaiva persuasion, amounted to a concrete and 
sustained program of providing for the social welfare down through the generations. During 
the foundational festivities, people are fed en masse, and pots, pans, clothing, and other 
concrete material goods are distributed within the crowd. Far from being a one-time occasion, 
marked by acts of mass ritual and a processional, the founding of a sacred center is to be 
celebrated on a yearly basis in perpetuity. Each such yearly festival marks a time when the 
poor, the sick, and the desperate, independent of their bearing aligned religious commitments, 
will be fed and material goods will be donated to them. Finally, as part of its ordinary 
operations, such institutions kept on staff certain śivayogins who dedicated their lives to 
providing medical care to the sick and desperate, about whom we know precious little, 
although they are already mentioned in the Śivadhamaśāstra.790 
790Śivadharmaśāstra 11.40–42: rogārtasya śivaṃ kṛtvā bheṣajādyaiḥ prayatnataḥ / yugakoṭiśataṃ sāgraṃ śivaloke mahīyate // śivabhaktaṃ viśeṣeṇa rogārtaṃ yas tu pālayet / bhaiṣajyair vṛttidānena śivalokaṃ vrajed dhruvam // 
817The most dramatic part of the festival is surely the chariot procession. This occurs on 
the penultimate day of the festival and also coincides with a major moment of philanthropy. 
Here, on enroute to its new home, the mūrti or liṅga that will be installed in the sacred center 
first takes a joy ride in the company of the main patron. 
To the accompaniment of auspicious songs [sung by] non-widowed women who have living children [and] to the accompaniment of songs by young girl, with the auspicious declarations and [the crying out of] the word “victory!” accompanied by the playing of the conch and sounding of the bards, having finished the complete procedure, in accordance with available resource, [artisan and guru] should again offer water for ritual sipping, and do arcanā once again using the heart mantra. All that one should do with the heart [mantra]. Otherwise, [do this ritual] using the praṇava [mantra], O one with good observances. 
In a chariot, which is very well restrained, which has been led there [to that place], uttering the heart mantra, he should cause it [the mūrti] to be lifted up [into the chariot.] Then, [it is to be placed within] a bed. All things which are needed for the purpose of the ritual bath: a stylus and a vessel full of “honey,” a pair of garments, pots and so forth: all that he should give to the śilpin, and at that time he should worship him (the śilpin). 
Having well restrained the mūrti on the chariot, one should circumambulate the city in yātrā. One should offer bali offerings to the directions and one should deposit the set of gems. 
One should pass out golden garlands and the garlands of pearls everywhere. One should pass out the golden vessels and vessels fashioned from copper and silver. And one should pass out various kinds of bell metal vessels with gadgets and so forth. One should pass out garments and cowrie shells and various forms of wealth. One should pass out parched grains, along with flowers, and all matter of crops. One should pass out such things [at a pavilion] endowed with yak tail fans. It should be crowded with flags and canopies shining with mirrors and so forth, hung with garlands of pearls, accompanied by flowers and dhūpa and a collection of lamps and sconces. 
Thus he [the patron] should circumambulate up to the edge of the city, or to the edge of an agricultural village, or [to the edge] of a village. In that place, all the temples of Śiva and so forth which were previously constructed are to be worshipped with effort, 
sarvayatnena mahatā yantu kuryād arogiṇam / śivalokakuḍumbī syāt tasya puṇyam anantakam // “The one who with effort by means of medicine and so forth pacifies a person who is afflicted by disease will rule in Śivaloka for the entirety of a one hundred crores of yugas. The person who protects a śivabhakta in particular who is afflicted with disease by means of medical treatment or by giving sustenance will certainly go to Śivaloka. The one who by a great all-encompassing effort makes [people] no longer ill is one who has a family in Śivaloka; of him there is endless merit.” 
818 
with the gems from the earth, with [offerings comprised of] herds of cows, horses, and elephants. 
He should offer [to the] twice-borns, and to the blind, the poor, and the afflicted in accordance with his wealth. In particular, he should give special dakṣiṇā to the ones who bear the Śiva liṅga [liṅgadhāraṇa]. Thus, according to apportionment the king should make pradakṣiṇā around the city. And by the others [other classes of patrons], otherwise, it is to be done according to their own wealth. 
However many feet the chariot should travel in its acting capacity of assistance to Śiva, the agent of this ritual obtains the fruit for that many koṭis of aśvamedhas. At the time after installing, on that day, every year, [a celebration is to be enacted]. So long as the liṅga remains established, one must do a processional performance [on a yearly basis]. [And] he, the king, obtains that very fruit, there is no doubt. 
Whoever has the land, at whatever time, of him is the result. If out of delusion it is not protected, he [the patron and his successors] gets cooked in the Raurava hell and so forth. The protection of the unending grant is renowned as aligned with the capacity/power of Śiva. One should have the well restrained chariot process in such a way that God can be prostrated to. 
Having made an auspicious journey, they arrive at the yāga ground. One should take the image situated on the chariot and cause it to descend onto the bhadrapīṭha accompanied by the praṇava mantra.791 
We begin with spectacle paired with ritual. Murmuring mantras under their breath, the 
artisan and ācārya wrap up the last of the ritual procedures that will enable the image to travel,

819 
their activities entirely drowned out by formalized cheering and music. With the assistance of 
the artisans and their guru, the sthāpanācārya, the image is lifted up into its seat in the 
processional chariot. As it prepares to depart, the artisans are formally honored, while also 
receiving the ritual paraphernalia that will be required when the image is installed in its new 
permanent home. This deliberate division of human attention continues to punctuate the whole 
affair. 
While the artisans and the guru go and make blood offerings to the directional deities 
and also ritually install in the ground a container full of precious gems, philanthropic activities 
directed at a wider public are being carried out by distinctive agents at two discrete locations. 
On the one hand, near the spot from which the chariot departs, a large tented pavilion is 
established, bedecked in gems, pearls, and mirrors. Here the sthāpanācārya’s own community 
distributes “golden, copper, and silver vessels,” “bell metal vessels,” and “gadgets 
(yāntrikas),” “clothing, cowry shells” “various forms of wealth,” and all “matter of crops.” 
Concurrently, as the chariot commences its own circumambulation of the borders of the new 
city, the patron makes a point of visiting each of the already established temples in the vicinity 
of his route. While he pauses to pay his respect, their residents and managers receive a bounty 
of “gems from the earth, herds of cows, horses, and elephants.” The patron is enjoined to offer 
gifts to all the people who cross his path, “in accordance with his wealth” or who follow along 
after the processional. While “twice-borns, the blind, the poor and afflicted” are certainly taken 
care of, the Piṅgalāmata reserves the best donations to the ones who bear the Śiva liṅga 
(liṅgadhāraṇa), which is to say, to śivabhaktas, though it is unclear whether such people were 
defined by wearing the mark of the tripuṇḍra or, prefiguring the early modern iṣṭaliṅgas of the 
Vīraśaivas, by virtue of bearing on their bodies a miniature portable liṅga. Setting aside such 
820 
specificities, this singling out of special dakṣiṇā reserved for Śaivas confirms that we are not 
talking about the mere redistribution of resources within a community that shares common 
values, but rather wide-ranging acts of mass philanthropy. 
It is worth pausing for moment to reflect on some the larger social implications of 
linking the originary moment of institution building of a Śākta-Śaiva center with the generation 
and redistribution of property on the one hand and the persistence of such an institution with 
regularly reoccurring charitable work. Despite its thriving mercantile culture, the medieval 
Deccan was not a consumer-based economy. This was a world where most people were much 
more likely to have inherited the property and tools they used in everyday life—such as a metal 
cooking pot—than they were to have purchased the things themselves. As we have seen 
throughout our study, this is also a world that holds generosity and philanthropy in the highest 
esteem. Much like in modern India, the power and prestige of the local big man is less a matter 
of how much he property he owns than it is of how much he gives away and what sort of 
benefits will accrue from securing his favor.792 In the Piṅgalāmata’s representation of the 
processional chariot as a veritable charity van on wheels, which as it passes through the 
countryside is constantly passing out food, wealth, and gadgets, we see perhaps a distant 
ancestor of the sorts of schemes that practically define south Indian politics today—one might 
think for example of the many tales from Tamil Nadu of when Jayalalitha’s people rolled into 
town and handed out televisions and sacks of grain off the back of trucks while asking for 
villagers’ votes.793 In a nondemocratic society prior to the age of mechanical reproduction, if 
792For a masterful discussion of this social dynamic grounded in careful enthographic work in modern Chennai, see Mattison Mines, Public Faces, Private Lives: Community and Individuality in South India (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994). 793To cite just one example from popular media, “Ayyappan, a resident of the samathuvapuram, and his wife, A. Anbu, were the first to receive the free colour television set. A beaming Ayyappan said that it was the first time that he saw ‘big people like the Chief Minister so near’ and the moment was yet to sink in. Helped by his sons, he carried the 14-inch colour television home, and, almost immediately, switched it on. Many people who had 
821 
it is anachronistic to speak of public opinion per se, perhaps we can speak of the cultivation of 
favor and public affection. By providing quotidian and lasting benefits to ordinary people, in 
a world of seemingly benevolent big men, our Śākta-Śaivas establish themselves and their 
undying institutions as perfect exemplars of charitable virtue. In a world of relative scarcity 
where people just do not expect to have very many things, the metal cooking pot you inherit 
from your grandmother becomes particularly precious, not only for its sentimental value, or 
because you cannot afford a new one, but precisely because it is a gift. From time to time, 
when the family looks at grandma’s fancy metal cooking pot, it is only natural that many people 
would experience a certain sense of gratitude, directed it not only towards ancestors who 
provided so well for the family, but also to the strange powerful people who dwell by the 
hillside who bestowed upon the household such a special gift. 
For our Kālamukhas, on the other hand, as will become clear when we turn to the 
Piṅgalāmata’s self-reflections of how the rituals surrounding image installation are informed 
by Śākta doctrine, providing the pot where a family cooks its meals is a concrete enactment of 
their core theological commitment that all of things in the world are intrinsically pure and 
suffused with god’s power. This precisely why our text will prescribe that every implement 
used in the ritual itself must be given away. When a pot or a spoon or some gadget leaves the 
śivapura and crosses out into the wider world of saṃsāra, it becomes the agent for making real 
the pervasive character of god’s power, concrete signs that Bhairava’s favor enters into and 
persists in a world defined by apparent disparity and diversity. In the very same manner as the 
come to the function joined to check out the television set.” R. K. Radhakrishnan, “Free TV sets distribution begins,” The Hindu, September 16, 2006. http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/free- tv-setsdistribution-begins/article3076310.ece For the continuation of if this paradigm, albeit within the arena of modern Tamil politics, see Bernard Bate, Tamil Oratory and the Dravidian Aesthetic: Democratic Practice in South India (New York: Columbia University Press, 2009). Comparable work specific to the Kannadiga social milieu seems yet to have been conducted in a European language.

god they aim to embody, overbrimming like an ocean of compassion, through nurturing, 
healing, and enriching human beings, our Śākta-Śaivas pontiffs and their disciples present 
themselves in palpable ways as travelling through the world indiscriminately showering people 
with favor and grace. 
Śākta-Śaiva spaces, in other words, come replete with their own mass distributive mode 
of political economy. Even more so than its purely Śaiva predecessors, it reaches down and 
across the entire spectrum of Indian society to deliver concrete material benefits. As we shall 
see, such an approach to who receives the benefit from the regular mode of operation of 
religious institutions finds its antithesis in the minimally distributive Smārta model that 
succeeds it, which we will explore in chapter 9. Indeed, a key part of the rationale for 
explicating the Piṅgalāmata’s grammar of ritual installation through the type of thick 
descriptive approach the present section has immersed you in is that familiarizing ourselves 
with these nitty gritty details will make their systematic subversion and inversion as it 
manifests in the mid-thirteenth-century Smārta sources all the more jarring. 
Before we address in more detail the esoteric dimensions of our Tantra’s discussion of 
what is involved in the installation of an image, for that is where our text most emphatically 
expresses the “insider” theology that animates this festival, our study of the exoteric 
dimensions of pratiṣṭhā, primarily as a site for social service, will benefit from an examination 
of the concluding ceremonies held on the very last day. After many days of free concerts and 
dramatic performances, the image has circumambulated the future śivapura and just been fixed 
and place and ritually installed in its new home inside the temple, a procedure that entailed a 
range of secretive and rather transgressive Śākta rituals, including the production and offering 
of vīradravya by the artisans and ācārya. As the artisans and their teacher emerge from inside 
823 
the private or even secret spaces of the garbhagṛha and the place of the moon, they assemble 
in a slightly more accessible domain on the grounds to offer a series of seven fire oblations 
dedicated to Bhairava. To ward off any gaps in the procedure, the mahāpāśupatāstra is recited 
one hundred times. The space secured, they rejoin the patron who sponsored the construction 
of the site. He comes forward, proclaiming, as if from a script (paṭhec chrāvanakaṃ padaṃ), 
the following words: “He nātha,” he says, addressing at once the god and the ācārya, “now at 
this time of the ritual, whatever ritual acts have been done or not done, you should now make 
it complete, O supreme Lord, by means of your Śakti.”794 Clandestinely, the Śākta pantheon 
of the Brahmayāmala is now venerated. Accompanied by his cohort, comprised of close 
friends and family, the patron is bathed in a series of unctions suffused with pacificatory 
mantras. This results in the conferral of the benefits of initiation, if it has not already been 
granted on some other occasion, as well as ensuring the party’s eventual liberation. 
Having had him bathed, many times, a gold auspicious bracelet is to be given on the right hand. A darbha grass one is used if that is not possible. Therefore, by this act the fruit that is called pratiṣṭhā is formally handed over to him. According to the determination in the śāstra, it is bestowed upon the patron himself. He has his own śānta pot as well. And he should first install Śiva in that. He makes it into a śivatīrtha. He should sprinkle one hundred clothes on the ground. For the sake of nirvāṇa on the part of those who belong to his group, there is the fashioning of the tīrtha for the purpose of liberation. The śivatīrtha is all around, a measure of one hundred cubits in length. And in that place, whatever creatures die by “renunciation,” they become similar to the three-eyed Śiva and obtain the realm of Śiva. 
Therefore, having first gone to worship Śiva, having bowed down with the eight limbs like a stick, with the knees gone to the earth, the patron should honor the guru with praise. Having done three pradakṣinas, the agent, having bowed again and again, a whole lot, accompanied by ācārya and so forth, should go indeed to the yāgamaṇḍapa.795 
794Piṅgalāmata: evaṃ pāśupataṃ japtvā paṭhec chrāvaṇakaṃ padaṃ / kriyākāle ’tha he nātha yāgakarma kṛtākṛtaṃ // pūrṇaṃ svaśaktisaṃyogāt karotu parameśvaraḥ / 795Piṅgalāmata: snāpayitvā tato bhūya kaṅkaṇaṃ hemajaṃ śubhaṃ / dakṣahaste tu dātavyaṃ darbhajaṃ cāpy asambhave // tena tasya pratiṣṭhākhyaṃ phalaṃ samyak samarpitaṃ / bhavate kārakasyaiva yathāśāstrasya niścayaḥ // svakaḥ śāntighaṭaś caiva punaḥ pūrvaṃ śivaṃ nyaset / śivatīrthaṃ ca tat kalpya siñced vastraśataṃ bhuvi // nirvāṇārthaṃ tadvargāṇāṃ muktyarthaṃ tīrthakalpanā / śivatīrthaṃ samantāt tu śatahastapramāṇataḥ // tasmin sthāne ca ye satvāḥ sanyāsena mriyanti vā / trinetrāḥ śivatulyās tu śivalokam avāpnuyāt // tasmād gatya 
824 
Passing from semi-private space where soteriological benefits were conferred on select 
people, patron, guru, and artisans reenter into multifunctional public space. Ascending onto a 
platform, the patron is seated on a special seat crafted just for this purpose as the guru retakes 
his throne for a now public display of performative devotion. 
Having grasped the feet of the guru, having with effort made him gracious, having made him repose on an easeful seat, from the top of the head to the bottom of his feet, having gone with the knees to the ground, having bowed to the guru, then [the patron], having smeared [his guru’s body] with candana and so forth, should worship him by offering divyapuṣpa. [To him is offered] the pair of divine garments, and one should dhūpa him with divine dhūpa placed upon a cloth. [To the guru is to be offered] ornaments of gold and gems, cloths, horses and calves, elephants, territories, villages, and grounds, [equipped] with paid labor, virgins, and vehicles with collections of crops such as grains and so forth, with female water buffalos and mahouts. 
Having satisfied with great effort the guru with a large number of divine gifts, [having relinquished] the debt of wealth to the guru. . . on the occasion when the procession is moving, he should give jewels and land and at the end he should venerate, worship, and pay the mūrtidharas. The dakṣiṇā is renowned to be equal in amount to half of half of what you give the sthāpaka. For all the mūrtipas, the same dāna is offered. 
O beautiful faced one, one should give a portion less than half of that to the sādhakas. For the putrakas, there is half of the [dakṣiṇā bestowed on sādhakas], and half of that again for the samayins. Less than a quarter of [what was given to samayins] is given to the Brāhmaṇas, and then for the ritual attendants, less than half of that again [which was given to the Brāhmaṇas.] Less by a quarter of that to the Brāhmaṇas, and then, for ritual assistants, half of that again. Half of that again for the troops of musicians, and half of that in turn for theater folks. 
According to capacity, there is to be given dāna to the poor, blind, and afflicted. He should honor the relatives and dependents of the women and unmarried women of his own gotra. He should release those situated in bondage, and he should not harm living beings.796

825 
As the festivities draw to a close and the guru and his ritual retinue are compensated 
for the duties they have just executed, there is a rather public and altogether jarring 
demonstration of the relative value of the contributions of the various different types of social 
agents that made the preceding events possible. Next to the ācārya in his role as sthāpaka, it 
is the different classes of artisans, the mūrtidhāras and mūrtipas, who receive the largest 
salaries. As we can see, in sequence, sādhakas, putrakas, the potential successors to the office 
of ācārya, and samayin initiates into ritual systems that underlie the Piṅgalāmata, many of 
which descend from the Picumata, receive the lion share of rewards. In contrast, Brāhmaṇas, 
who in normative Dharmaśāstra would be esteemed as the best recipients of dāna, receive 
comparatively little. To put this in perspective, if, for example, the guru received $100,000, 
the mūrtidharas and mūrtipas would have received $25,000 each, the sādhakas would receive 
approximately797 $12,000, the putrakas $6,000 and the samayins $3,000. Each Brāhmaṇa 
could expect around $700 dollars. Succinctly, the Piṅgalāmata values Brāhmaṇa ritualists at a 
market rate slightly above that of unskilled labor and the performing artists whose role in the 
proceedings were occasional and perfunctory. Now that everybody has been paid, while 
another bali “that bestows all desires,” quite possibly a human sacrifice, is offered, under the 
tatpādūnaṃ dvijānāṃ tu sahāyānāṃ tadarddhakaṃ // tadarddhaṃ vandivṛndānāṃ bhaṇḍānāṃ ca tadarddhakaṃ / yathāśaktyā pradātavyaṃ dīnāndhakṛpaṇeṣv api // svagotrastrīkumārīṇāṃ mānayet bhṛtyabāndhavān / bandhanasthāś ca moktavyā na hiṃset prāṇinaṃ priye // 797The proportions for compensation for the sthāpaka guru and his śilpins are fixed. In contrast, beginning with the sādhaka, there is some flexibility in the salary scale, as we are told the portion belonging to the sādhakas (sādhakānāṃ tadaṃśaṃ tu hīnaṃ) should be somewhat less (hīna) than half of the half of the original allotment assigned to the mūrtidharas. We find this exact same use of hīna in the technical portions of the treaty that deal with measurements. While many of the key elements that make up a building must be constructed according to exact proportional relationships, depending on principles of engineering as well as determined in relationship to the physical features of patron, in other cases, perhaps to avoid wasting materials, slight deviations are explicitly permitted. Incidentally, speaking of deviating from norms, the Piṅgalāmata’s use of mūrtidhāra and mūrtipa in the sense of artisans diverges radically from the typical nomenclature in Tantric discourse where the two words are synonymous and refer to the non-artisan human ritual models used for the production of anthropomorphic images. 
826 
noses of the assembled public, the patron feeds the vīradravya to any initiates who are present. 
Then, at long last, the guru convenes the closing ceremonies, calling on everyone assembled 
to share in the experience that has been made possible by his grace. 
In order that there should a spreading of sympathetic joy (anumodana) [among everyone] at the obtaining of the result, he announces “O dear one, it is because of your grace, O lord, all of this is made manifest.” Having invited him [the patron] to share the joy then, once again, the guru invites all the others to share in bountiful joy. [He proclaims], “from my grace, the result of this ceremony has become characterized as having the nature of a completed liṅga.” Whatever the particular the aim that was desired [by each assembled person], that he should invite the others to enjoy that sort of result.798 
[In the manner of] motes that are seen when the sun comes in shafts through a netted window, just as many are the pieces of wood, bricks, and stone as to be found in the platform where there is installed the liṅga, the ceremonial flag, and so forth. By such a standard, he remains in the world and moves about from place to place again and again. At the end of the body, first, the patron goes to the world of brahman. For such amount of time, he enjoys pleasures, at the end, he goes to the niṣkala realm. The patron draws up his family, on both sides, below and above [seven generations before and after him into heaven]. Together with his wife and sons, he should give plentiful wealth [to support the endowment of the śivapura]. One should offer oneself and one’s merit to the guru. 
In this manner, the illustrious guru is satisfied. Recollecting the Śiva-state, the guru makes [the ritual] complete and even. With his left hand, the ācārya should worship with sweet smelling things and flowers, and he should offer an argha to the top of the liṅga. And after this, the one who’s self is doing bhāvanā, having bowed again and again [before the god], he [the ācārya] lives in accordance with the will of him [the god]799 for so long as he lives.800 
798Notice again the rhetorical and conceptual continuities with the logic of community solidarity expressed by the Śivadharmaśāstra we explored in chapter 3. 799As Dominic Goodall has pointed out in private communication, this arrangement, in which the ācārya remains rooted to the land grant until the end of his days, is entirely unknown to Siddhānta sources and yet at the same time is conspicuously featured in the inscriptional record of the Kālamukhas of the Deccan on the one hand and the Atimārgic Śaivas of Cambodia and Laos on the other. There are interesting and probably historically significant parallels this with the habitation patterns of the Nāth mahants at Mangalore in modern-day Karnataka. See Véronique Boullier, Monastic Wanderers. Nāth Yogī Ascetics in Modern South Asia (New Delhi: Manohar, 2017). 800Piṅgalāmata: phalānumodanārthāya vijñaptiṃ kurute priye / tatprasādāc ca he nātha sarvam etat pradarśitaṃ // tasyānumodanād bhūyo guruś caivānumodayet / matprasādāt samastaṃ hi pūrṇaliṅgātmakaṃ phalaṃ // yadiṣṭasādhanaṃ vāpi tatsarvaṃ cānumodayet / jalasyāntargate bhānau ye dṛṣṭās tu sareṇavaḥ // yāvad dārviṣṭakāśmānāṃ liṅgavedīdhvajādiṣu / pramāṇaṃ tāvat talloke sthānāt sthānāt paraṃ vrajet // piṇḍānte brahmalokaṃ tu prathamaṃ yāti kāraṇaḥ / bhogān tātkālikān bhuktvā yāty ante niṣkalaṃ tataḥ // pūrvāparakuloddhāryaṃ dvipakṣyaikasamanvitaṃ / puṣkalaṃ ca dhanaṃ dadyāt patnīputrasamanvitaḥ // ātmānaṃ gurave caiva svapuṇyaṃ vinivedayet / tataḥ tuṣṭo guruḥ śrīmān śivatatvam anusmaran // saṃpūrṇaṃ 
827Despite the fact that they have been holding space together for five days, it is only in 
the last moments of the ritual where guru invites everyone to taste the same joy that the 
assembled public and initiates alike are directed to share a common affective experience. This 
affect in turn is paired with the possibility that each of the discrete human aims of all the people 
assembled will come to fruition by means of the guru’s grace, in much the same manner that 
the patron and his lineage are ensured liberation as well as the worldly enjoyments of a 
sādhaka. While such affect is incidental to the wider public’s perception of the five-day 
pratiṣṭhā festival, which to them seems to be comprised of spectacle, entertainment, free food, 
blessings, and concrete material benefits, for initiates, the cultivation and deployment of 
affective modalities that produce altered states of consciousness is the inner life that animates 
every moment of the ritual process. 
Just as the guru only becomes capable of making the ritual even and complete when he 
“recollects” Śiva’s state, and, therefore, using embodied meditation is granted the privilege of 
living alongside the image of his lord under the direction of the god’s will until the end of his 
days, so too the artisans’ and disciples’ ability to perform their ritual responsibilities is entirely 
dependent on their capacity to channel and embody the different facets of the god’s power. At 
every stage in the Pratiṣṭhāpaṭala, the technical instructions addressed to śilpins for the 
production and preparation of images as well as the rituals that punctuate these processes are 
paired with second order theological reflections on the connections between artisanal praxis 
and theology. Here, for example, in the passages immediately preceding the Piṅgalāmata’s 
account of the chariot processional, is how our text explores the hidden linkages between the 
final stages in the installation of an image, when the lines are drawn upon an aniconic liṅga or 
tatsamaṃ kṛtvā vāmahastena pūjayet / gandhapuṣpādibhir mantrī tacchirāsi tad arghayet // tatas tu bhāvitātmā ca praṇamya ca punaḥ punaḥ / tadicchāyānuvartī ca yāvajjīvaṃ tu vartayet // 
828 
the eyes of a figurative image are opened, and the ontological and epistemological premises 
that render this act efficacious. 
The best thickness for the lines [marking lakṣaṇa] is half of a half of a grain of barley. Knowing this he should draw the lines correctly. By means of the drawing the lakṣaṇas in various ways, according to the distinctions in the operation of bhāva, everything is obtained. From the conjunction with these operations, in the absence of a bhava, all that is obtained are frustrated results. [A question is raised:] If a result could be obtained from a liṅga regardless of whether it is conjoined with bhāva or abhāva, then, I tell you verily, what is the purpose of the lakṣaṇas? [Answer:] If you have a liṅga with these lakṣaṇas, then it is called “with the appropriate signs.” If it is without lakṣaṇas, then it is deficient. Therefore, with great effort, you should perform the raising of the lakṣaṇas. When the liṅga is conjoined with characteristics that are according to one’s own desire, then the liṅga assumes that nature. 
If you want an example, I will tell you. O beloved, this is the liṅga resorted to by one’s own self. The great self is [what is called] Śaiva. When one’s self is conjoined with [Śiva’s] tejas, that is the definition [in this case of having the proper characteristic marks]; in much the same manner, later will be taught the characteristics of the raising of the marks [on an image] as understood by learned people. 
Now, if there is some cause for great frustration, as when there is heat despite there being shade from the clouds, O goddess, since śivatva is not directly perceivable, one has to discern it by causing to make it manifest through pacification rites then, by means of the lakṣaṇa, a special presence of Śambhu is discerned. . . . 
[In contrast, liṅgas made of certain materials do not require the raising of lakṣaṇas.] For, such liṅgas as already possess of their own accord their own tejas; the lakṣaṇas are already present. This also pertains to the bāṇaliṅga—for them, they have a mark (aṅka) that is their own defining quality, and for them ritual such as bathing and so forth should be performed. On the part of them, and also for images (arcā) that are vyakta and so forth [fully sculpted or liṅgas with faces,] the opening of the eyes is stated to be what gives them their defining characteristics as objects of worship. 
The guru should trace out the lines on that [image] with a stylus made of gold. Following the path outlined by the guru, the śilpin should then gouge out the outline, with a weapon that is very sharp, [making a line] without dot-like breaks with great skill, he should complete [this task] without breaking the image. The line is not discontinuous, it is not too fat, and it never is too thin. By those desiring the fruit of bhoga and mokṣa, it is well filled out. However, for certain kinds of sādhana, you make the lines beginning with dots and with break marks. In the case of an ugly deed, a beautiful image is an obstacle, and in the case of a beautiful deed, the absence of beauty is an obstacle.801

829 
In an important unpublished talk, entitled “Secrecy and Obscurity,” given at SOAS as 
part of the Haṭha Yoga Project in 2016, Alexis Sanderson has argued that one of the defining 
features of the Bhairava and Śākta Tantras is that, in contrast to the Śaiva Siddhānta, they 
habitually represent the mechanical performance of external ritual actions, yogic praxis, or 
postures as inefficacious when they are not executed in tandem with concrete forms of mental 
cultivation.802 In this corpus, such mental cultivation often is linked with the key terms bhāva 
and bhāvanā. To paraphrase Sanderson’s oral presentation, bhāva, he tells us, means 
something like when the mind—not just attention—is directed by insight, resulting in a clear 
cognitive orientation towards a given goal. Insight, in this context, has a concrete content 
incorporating both specific semantics and emotional states. In other words, it is the integration 
of content suffused affective states into praxis by means of yoga. While in the later 
gnosological worldview of the post-scriptural Kālī Krama, whose views are largely adopted 
by Abhinavagupta, the internal cultivation of affective cognitive states such as bhāva can be 
said to at times to effectively replace modes of doing, in the Śākta Tantras themselves, it 
functions as a necessary but not sufficient condition rendering practice efficacious.

A quite similar logic seems to define the passage above, which argues that while the 
presence or absence of bhāva is what makes an installation function, the inscribing on images 
of the proper sorts of markings, either the lines evoking a glans on a liṅga or the pupil of the 
eye on an iconic image, remain absolutely necessary. This seems to be the case for two reasons. 
Somewhat straightforwardly, since the presence of divine energy is often difficult to perceive 
directly, providing physical indication that the śilpin and ācārya have followed the proper 
procedure enables us to infer the “special presence of Śambhu.” In other words, since all the 
other visible steps are present, we can assume that the installation of the proper sorts of energies 
in the icon was enacted by an artisan who had himself aligned cognitively and somatically with 
these selfsame energies while carrying out his task. In essence, putting the proper finishing 
touches on an object so that we can infer its hidden inner nature does the same cultural work 
in regard to the material world that the visceral manifestation of physical signs such as 
horripilation, shaking, and passing out accomplishes in the ecstatic realm of Śākta initiations, 
gesturing palpably towards subtle presences. 
Somewhat more curiously, our text also seems to be suggesting that the logic we are 
exploring has a much broader explanatory power. Succinctly, in its rather colloquial somewhat 
anti-scholastic roundabout way, the Piṅgalāmata asserts the production of particularized 
identity here within this world is always an emergent phenomenon. Things becoming what 
they are is in essence the product of the synergy between specific types of material substrates 
and particular energetic resonances mediated through the intentionality of the agent performing 
the act of creation, whether a man or a god. For this reason, when the goddess asks Bhairava 
for an example of how the interfacing of lakṣaṇa and bhāva works, he unexpectedly responds 
with an example that suggests that, in human beings, the raising of lakṣaṇas that awakens a 
831 
substance into its full potential is the product having performed the forced conjoining of the 
inner fire (tejas), which has the nature of Śiva, with one’s own body and nature. In other words, 
it is either the achievement of liberation itself or the experience of an initiation that ultimately 
results in liberation. Succinctly, human awareness and the soul abide in the body in exactly the 
same way that presence suffuses an awakened icon. Just as in familiar yogas, which necessarily 
entails the preparation and purification of the vessel that is the human body so that śaktis will 
abide in it in proper places, because pratiṣṭhā is itself but another form of yoga, installing an 
image with the proper śaktis demands highly specific material preparations. Just as eating the 
wrong kinds of foods or performing prāṇāyāma in a manner that directs vital breaths into the 
wrong channels can deform the practice of a yogin, deviations in the artisan’s external 
procedures, such as the drawing of a dotted line, change the nature of the image and what sort 
of results one can expect to procure from its worship. Purpose, energetic focus, and material 
shape must be made to coincide. In this spirit, in a series of passages we will not be examining 
in detail, our text proceeds to offer an extensive catalog taxonomizing the impacts of different 
types of liṅgas as determined by their shape, the bhāva, such as an expression of wrath or a 
desire for fecundity, with which they have been infused, and the material substance of which 
they are composed. Just how seriously the Piṅgalāmata takes the theory that image making is 
homologized with the production of a human being becomes evident in a remarkable passage 
the text presents when discussing the moment when a liṅga or mūrti is to be installed in its 
base inside of a temple. 
Having purified that directly once again a whole lot, he should cause the śakti to enter in a secure fashion. When it is purified, the triad [of energies] should be installed in a liṅgavedī made of stone. Having done the oblation, which has the purpose of fulfilling the injunction, after that, one should install the three śaktis. One should install the jñānaśakti in the liṅga, and the kriyāśakti in the base. One should cause the dhāraṇī śakti to be placed in the stone which consists of Brahmā. By means of the pūrṇāhuti 
832 
procedure, having meditated on the union in conjunction with [atha?], having done pūjā with scents and flowers. . . . 
Having meditated on the śakti, differentially arranged, [and on] the one who possesses the śakti [i.e., Bhairava], having done the thing that goes beyond meditation, you should cause it [the śakti] to enter with the emanation sequence [of mantras]. Having installed it so that it becomes steady, O god, in the mouth of the stone portion of Brahmā by means of one’s own mantra, having meditated on the supreme abode, which is caused by the thing beyond causation, having conjoined, by means of meditation, each property with the property bearer, one should cause consciousness to be installed in the non-sentient [object]. By means of the yogas of the equinox, the cumbaka has a focused mind.803 
Placing an aniconic liṅga into its stone base involves both the mechanical act of fixing 
it in a secure fashion so it does not wobble and move about as well as the infusion of the top 
of the liṅga, the so called brahmā bhāga, with the power of jñānaśakti, and the piṇḍikā, the 
base, or colloquially, the “yoni” in which the liṅga rests with kriyāśakti. The artisan and ācārya 
first must identify themselves with Bhairava, the one who possesses the śakti, and then align 
themselves with energetic state of the different flavors of śakti by means of esoteric yogic 
practices. Just as one joins together spatially and logically related physical objects, the artisan 
must also visualize the conjunction of properties and property bearer as they are distributed 
throughout the hierarchy of the planes of reality, each of which has its own ontological nature 
and propensities and all of which are superimposed energetically onto the image as part of the 
production process. Once the universe in all its variegation has been mapped onto the sacred 
site through directed meditative attention informed by insight, in precisely the same manner a

yogin would superimpose the planes on his own body, the image can be conjoined with its 
base. 
Having made a praṇāli in the northern quadrant, he should begin the installation of kriyāśakti. Having known her to consist of the sūkṣmakalā, you should inquire into the time of fertility. Just as the possessor of the body is joined within the body, in that very same way, one must install kriyāśakti in jñānaśakti. In just the same way that one who enjoys is joined with enjoyment, the kriyā is in jñāna. Having installed the bodha and kriyā [śakti], the thing that is being set down is understood in just the same manner as the object of knowledge is [said to be] emitted from knowledge. Just as in the case of the reflections of the sun and the moon, the kalā of them has become one. Even so, having recollected in that very same way, one should cause dṛk and kriyā to enter. 
The piṇḍikā is to be understood as being like the body and the liṅga is to be known of as the embodied one. The piṇḍikā is to be known of as the [experience of] enjoyment, and the liṅga is the one who enjoys. The piṇḍikā is like gnosis, O Bhadrā, liṅga is said to be like the thing to be known. O honored one, the piṇḍikā is like the moon and the liṅga is said to be the sun. Having conceived of kriyā śakti in the body, one should conceive of gnosis as being the embodied one. . . . Having known kriyā to be like the moon, gnosis is like the sun. Kriyāśakti should be known in the manner of a fertile woman, O beautiful faced one. Jñānaśakti is the thing to be known, like a man possessed of passion, and the installation of dṛk and kriyā is to be known like the union of a man and young girl. 
What is the point of speaking more confusing examples? You and I were conjoined like this previously—that was the cause of the sustaining of the world. In a similar manner, the union of dṛk and kriyā is the union of the property bearer [and its properties], which is the cause of actions. And you are a direct manifestation of kriyāśakti, which is situated in the form of the base. And I have the form of knowledge, O auspicious one, which is established in the form of the liṅga. And this is said to be installation in the temple, O goddess.804 
In this passage, both the relationships between the two śaktis as well the interfacing of 
icon and its base are characterized as being governed by four seemingly distinctive cognitive 
804Piṅgalāmata: praṇālaṃ uttare kṛtvā kriyāsthāpanam ārabhet / sūkṣmakālātmakaṃ vedya ṛtukāle ca vīkṣayet // dehe dehī yathā yogaṃ tathā jñāne kriyāṃ nyaset / bhogye bhogī yathā yogaṃ yuñjej jñāne kriyāṃ tathā // bodhakriyā niviṣṭaṃ tu jñeyaṃ jñānāsṛtaṃ yathā / sūryendubimbayor yadvad ekībhūtā yathā kalāṃ // tathātrāpi smaritvā tu dṛkkriye saṃniveśayet / dehavat piṇḍikā jñeyā liṅgaṃ dehī ca kīrtitaṃ // bhogavat piṇḍikā jñeyā liṅgaṃ bhogī ca nānyathā / jñānavat piṇḍikā bhadre jñeyaval liṅgam ucyate // induvat piṇḍikā matye sūryaval liṅgam ucyate / kriya dehe va saṃkalpya jñānaṃ dehī ca kalpyate //. . . . candravat kriya bodhavyā sūryavaj jñānam ucyate / ṛtukanyeva bodhavyā kriyāśakti varānane // puṃvad rāgānvitaṃ jñeyaṃ jñānaśakti na saṃśayaḥ / puṃkanyā yogavat jñeyaṃ dṛkkriyāsaṃniveśanaṃ // atha kim bahunoktena dṛṣṭāntākulitena tu / tvam aham ca yathā pūrvaṃ saṃyogaṃ sthitahetukaṃ // dṛkkriyā tu tathā yogo dharmiṇaḥ kriyahetukaṃ / tvaṃ ca sākṣāt kriyārūpā piṇḍīrūpā ca yā sthitā // jñānarūpam ahaṃ bhadre liṅgarūpeṇa yaḥ sthitaḥ / evaṃ saṃsthāpanaṃ proktaṃ prāsāde ca sureśvari // 
834 
metaphors. In the first frame, they are connected in the same manner that the soul, understood 
as both a witnessing agent and agent of enjoyment, abides within and governs the material 
body deploying it as a vehicle to have perceptual and sensual experiences. In the second 
epistemological frame, dṛk and kriyā śakti and liṅga and yoni are said to be related to each 
other in the very same manner that jñāna, understood as both gnosis and mental activity, both 
produces and participates in the perception of specific objects of knowledge and cognitive acts. 
In the third, perhaps the least developed, which likely also gestures towards the inner 
physiology of the yogic subtle body, the two elements are homologized to the sun and the 
moon. 
Finally, and most fundamentally, our text returns again and again to images of sexuality 
and reproduction as the dominant organizing frame. Thus, marked by the moment when the 
homa fire crackles in a certain manner, the right time for fixing the liṅga in its base is 
introduced as akin to the peak moment of human fertility. Having infused into the stone base, 
kriyāśakti is to be “known” by the liṅga as if it were a fertile woman being penetrated by a 
man possessed of passion (rāgānvita). When the two śaktis installed in their respective material 
substrates come together, “it is like the union of a man and a young girl.” Our text makes a 
point of evoking quite deliberately that this relationship is one of subordination and 
dependence; the witnessing and enjoying agent manipulates its material substrate, which is but 
a pale reflection of its own nature, towards its own ends. The object of knowledge, a byproduct 
of cognitive processes, is grabbed hold of by knowledge itself, just as a powerful man 
experiences pleasure when he takes and impregnates a young girl. 
All of these interrelationships, as the end of the passage makes plain, are in fact acts of 
mimesis, replicating the yāmala of Bhairava and Piṅgalā, where the one who owns the śakti 
835 
takes ownership of her in ecstatic sexual union. It is the repetition of this logic, at all different 
subtle and gross registers, our text tells us, that sustains the world. When we install an image 
in a temple, artisan and ācārya recreate the primordial yāmala, which continues without 
interruption from that moment onward in the heart of the temple. It is secretly this logic of 
yāmala, of all conjunctions as sexual unions, that not only govern the five-day festival, where 
huge, varied publics obliviously gather outside the divine boudoir awaiting the commencement 
of the love making of the god and goddess—but that also organize and holds together all of 
lived experience. The whole world is suffused with the power of the god and the goddess 
because iterations of their union form the cognitive and atomic building blocks that make up 
all of existence, out of which everything gross and subtle arises. Theologically speaking, the 
political sovereignty of the akṣayavṛtti is predicated on the permanent installation of a gross 
material instantiation of this union. In a sense, it arises spontaneously if inevitably from the 
establishing in lived space and human time of the causal vortex that is the source from which 
all forms of agency and power allegedly emerged. In this way as well, our text asserts, the 
whole world is Śākta whether it assents to such an understanding or not. The logic of the 
yāmala amounts to an emic political theology. Like any disciplinary system, it structures space 
and constrains human behavior. 
Revealing the Secret: Purity, Generosity, and the Worship of Caṇḍeśvara 
If the five-day pratiṣṭhā festival is designed as a performative reenactment of these core 
theological frames—an exercise, if you will, in making them real—we should scarcely be 
surprised that our festival also consciously plays out another of these core commitments: the 
hiding of transgressive forms of Śākta performativity in the quotidian flows of normal life. The 
message being communicated—to those equipped to perceive it—is that such apparent 
836 
transgressions must be understood as the real engines that make possible and sustainable 
ordinary existence. Towards this end, the largely public rituals we have explored in some detail 
are complemented by other types of procedures that occur concurrently with the major ritual 
events. The most striking instantiation of this dynamic is the integration into the festivities of 
another outwardly much humbler processional. 
At the very same moments that the ratha begins to circumambulate the territory 
dispensing charity all along the way and that the tent for the dispensing of charity adjacent to 
the maṇḍapa is carrying out its own philanthropic mission, the ācārya and his assistants 
surreptitiously prepare a small vessel (pātra), which will be placed upon a veiled palanquin 
and escorted by Brāhmaṇas chanting the Vedas on commission. This pātra, often simply 
referred to as “the secret,” will be used during the installation process inside the garbhagṛha 
and then will eventually take residence in the secret place in the domain of the moon, which 
contains an āgāra or private ritual space with its own courtyard. In esoteric terms, the vessel 
is in fact the goddess herself, and as the text will tell us, she abides in the body that is the 
territory of the akṣayavṛtti in the same way that the kuṇḍalinī śakti is present in a human being. 
As we might anticipate, our text is maddeningly enigmatic in its representation of this 
dimension of the ritual, and so, much of the reconstruction that follows is a matter of 
conjecture. The first place the pātra is mentioned is in our text’s discussion of the preparation 
of the sleeping chamber and bed, where the deity, either in the form of a liṅga or mūrti, spends 
the first night of the festival getting acclimated to his new home before being permanently 
installed in the piṇḍikā. This is a standard phase present in all of the literature on ritual 
installations, which frequently divides the preparation of an image into the crafting process, 
the incubation where mantras seep into the image while it is submerged in water suffused with 
837mantras, the bedding down for the night in its new home, the insertion of śaktis, and the final 
installation. As the image prepares to “rest,” once it has been swaddled in cloth and wrapped 
with mantras like a child tucked into its bed with its head facing east, a sleep pot (nidrākumbha) 
made of gold is placed near the head of the “bed.” While our text begins with this standard 
procedure, it rather jarringly wanders off in a rather different direction. 
There should be a pot of gold in the region of the head. It is said to be a sleep pot. The bed with the head facing the eastern direction is the best. Thus, the common procedure is proclaimed. [The pot is] full of the five jewels, adorned with cloths and so forth accompanied by scents and dhūpa, containing mango sprouts. Well hidden by a garland of flowers, one should place “auspicious gems.” 
Having given it the naivedya of various sorts, with liquids, and so forth, the pot is to be prepared in the following manner: with carrion and so forth, with liquor and so forth, ornamented with cloth and so forth, with perfume, flowers, dhūpa and the like—with all these things. One should then make argha [ritually offering these substances] using the heart mantra. One should practice with the heart mantra as if for the purpose of rubbing ointments on the feet. 
O goddess of gods, if you are offering human flesh (phalguṣa)805 and other such things, you do not do this with the praṇava mantra. If you are doing this with human flesh, you form an intention for the rite by cultivating a nondual mental state because [under such circumstances] the human meat is effectively nectar.806 
805The third volume of the Tāntrikābhidhanakośa mentions phalguṣa and mahāphalguṣa several times. The first example given is in the context of defining euphemisms for that which is “made from a human being,” and the second is own separate entry. narodbhava, a. [A], provenant d'un homme ; made of human being; vom Menschen stammend. Expression employee dans divers textes pour désigner la chair humaine à usage notamment rituel. Jayaratha cite ainsi (ad TÄ 4.243b, vol. 3, p. 268) la phrase suivante tirée du Vïrâvalïtantra : rsibhir bhaksitam puū rvam gomā msam ca narodbhavam : «Autrefois, les rsi mangeaient de la viande de vache et de la chair humaine ». Cela à propos des règles relatives à la pureté et à l'impureté, qui sont d'ordre essentiellement mondain (laukika) et que le sage peut ou doit dépasser. La chair humaine peut être designée par des expressions diverses, telles que mahā pala, mahā phalgu*, mahāmāmsa*. [A.P.]—> kuladravya, ksmäpala, dravya, phalgusa (TAK, vol. 3, pg. 253). phalgusa, n.nt. [A], viande ; meat; Fleisch.SvTU ad 2.286 defines it as human flesh (nṛ nmā msa). See SYM 14.3; TSB 6.64 sqq.; KMT 5.64, 10.117, 19.117, 123. Sometimes it is specified once more that this flesh is human, as in KMT 25.227 or in SYM 19.20, where it gets the adjective nā ra (human), or in TSB 14.64, where it is said to be "of men" (nrnā m). The word mahā - is also often prefixed to it, similarly to mahā māṃsa*(as in SYM 18.5, 25; KKKA 30v4; DDS[D] 83, 134). SYM 13.10 has even mahāphalgusamāmsa. Such usage may be explained by the fact that the word also means or originally meant meat. The PBY(H) also uses this word and its shortened form phalgu (e.g. in 20.39d, see also mahāphalgu for human flesh in 69.50a) to mean "meat" (v. 71.132c: mārjāraphalgusa for the flesh of a cat, 77.130d: krostukasya tu phalgusam for jackal meat). [J.T.] —* ksmāpala, dravya, dhānada, naivedya, pala, palā li, piś ita, mahāmāmsa. 806Piṅgalāmata: hemakumbhaḥ śiro deśe nidrākumbhas sa ucyate / prāk siraḥ śayanaṃ śreṣṭhaṃ sāmānyaṃ parikīrtitaṃ // pañcaratnasusaṃpūrṇaṃ vastrādyaiḥ samalaṅkṛtaṃ / gandhadhūpādisaṃyuktaṃ cūtapallavakānvitaṃ // puṣpamālāsusaṃcchannaṃ nyased ratnopari śubhaṃ / naivedyaṃ vividhaṃ datvā pānādyaṃ ca suvāsitaṃ // kravyādyaṃ cāsavādyāṃś ca vastrādyābharaṇāni ca / gandhapuṣpādi dhūpādyān 
838 
This pot next seems to surface on the following day, during which the ācārya and 
śilpins install images of the various deities that make up the retinue of the god and the goddess 
in various quadrants of the area surrounding the temple. These include the eight forms of Śiva 
(mūrtyaṣṭakaṃ), inherited from an earlier Pāśupata tradition, each which has its own śakti. 
They are followed by the Vidyeśvaras of the Saiddhāntika cosmology, including Ananta, the 
demiurge who rules our world, all of whom again are paired with śaktis. The Śākta goddesses 
Vāma, Jyeṣṭhā, Raudrī, with the unusual addition of Kālī are then given homes, followed by 
the eight Bhairavas. These later rituals use special Śākta Tantric mantras paired with acts of 
yogic visualization. As the text tells us:” Having known by means of dhāraṇā and one’s own 
meditation, [the images] to be pervaded [by their respective śaktis], one should properly install 
all of them, visualizing them to be yellow, red, black, blue, cloud color, and smoky in color.” 
Now that the retinue are in place, having ascended only as far in the hierarchy of planes as the 
level of vidyātattva, the agent that pervades everything, known of as Śiva, “must be meditated 
on in the middle.” For this part of the ritual, the ācārya and his śilpins enlist the aid of paid 
Brāhmaṇas. 
Having established twice-borns in the directions and the lord(s) and initiates, the Ṛgvedin is in the east and the Yājurvedin is in the domain of water. Likewise, the Sāmavedin is in the yama direction, and they know the Atharvan to be in the saumya direction. All should recite their own sūkta preceded by the Rudram in all cases. The yajamāna and likewise the others are all reciting what is commanded by the cumbakas. . . conjoined with the insight that has the nature of the pañcabrahma mantras directly and accompanied by cries of “victory!!”807

839 
Applying a veneer of Vedic ritual complemented by the ritual deployment of the 
pañcabrahma mantras so essential to Lākula and Kālamukha communities, the ācārya and 
artisans offer homa into eight fire pits, first installing the mantras of Rudra on their own bodies. 
While the chanting continues, the ācāryas take the image and its base and prepare the 
ceremonial bath. Euphemistically, the piṇḍa is said to “take refuge with water,” but clearly 
something different is really going on for here the text becomes incredibly gnomic. 
The nyāsa is to be done to the mūrti, which has the nature of the mantra. Likewise, the action is to be done with the mark of kriyā śakti. . . and at the end of the ritual, there is she who is known of as Kuṇḍalinī. The injunction involving bathing and so forth [is to be done] as with the liṅga in the soma quadrant. 
And here one should cause to have enacted the raising up of the defining marks for the object that has the form of a vagina (bhagākāraṃ). . . . So long as it is not seen by worldly people, it is made of śakti and designated for the secret [place?]. It is the best, the essence, and the chief thing, therefore, its characteristics are secret. Just like the liṅga is to be raised up, it is the same way with the secret thing, and it is to be installed with the golden stylus up from the Brahmā portion of the stone and at the root position in the liṅga. . . . 
The injunction for bathing and so forth is available but it is devoid of specifics. . . . She is said to be Anantaśakti known of as dhāriṇī and she is the mistress of causing stability and the agent of the cessation of everything. She alone is the material embodiment underlying the soul of everything. 
Having meditated on her as conjoined, she should be caused to enter. The teacher worships her, according to a desired vidhi, three times as before.808 
During the course of the five-day festival, this “secret thing,” which on the surface is a 
vessel identified with the goddess that contains various kinds of liquor, carrion, and lumps of 
human meat, is conveyed back and forth between its new residence in the somasthāna and the 
808Piṅgalāmata: mūrtimantrātmako nyāsaḥ tathā kāryaṃ kriyāṅkayā / sitavastrayugā sāpi kriyāntāḥ [x] nisaṃsthitā // kriyāntaṃ caiva śaktyantaṃ[?] yā sā kuṇḍalinīti ca / snānādiko vidhiś cātra liṅgavat saumyagocare // lakṣaṇoddharaṇaṃ cātra bhagākāraṃ tu vartayet /. . . . yathā na dṛśyate lokair guhyai śaktimayaṃ tataḥ / varaṃ sāraṃ pradhānaṃ ca atas tad guhyalakṣaṇaṃ // utkīrya liṅgavat tasyā guhyaṃ hemaśalākayā / brahmātmikāśilān nyasyo liṅge mūlapradeśataḥ // snānādikā vidhiḥ prāptā kiṃtu lakṣaṇavarjitā / svabhralakṣaṇasaṃyuktā pūrvaṃ vai pratipāditā // anantaśakti sā proktā dhariṇīti ca viśrutā / sthirakārīśa caivoktā viśvanirvṛttikārikā // seyaṃ sarvātmamūrtyekā yuktā dhyātvā niveśayet / saṃpūjya deśiko ‘bhīṣṭavidhinā tritayaṃ purā //

various chambers inside the temple. Though it seems he was spared the horror of recognizing 
how much more loathsome things than mere liquor were mixed into the brew, in accusing the 
Kālamukhas of “installing a pot containing alcoholic liquor and worshipping their deity in it,” 
Rāmānuja in his Śrībhāṣya offers description and not mere polemic.809 Travelling from the 
place the moon to the garbhagrḥa of the main temple, their special vessel in hand, the ācārya 
and artisans enact different stages of the ritual by suffusing different śaktis into the liṅga and 
its base. Each time the text specifies that there is to be a homa, a bath, some sort of exchange 
of energies, and a concluding śānti rite to pacify the powerful goddess. Our most detailed 
description of this procedure is presented in the context of outlining the installation of the 
kriyāśakti in the base of the plinth. 
O one with good vows, the culminating inner bath [is to be done] using the heart mantra. Having done the bath [using first the pañcagavya and then the pañcāmṛta], one must install the mantras, as you would in your own body, well arranged. 
As per the common procedure, one should install in the seat beginning with Ananta and ending with śakti; otherwise, in the particular, up to the end of the preta as is propounded in one’s own śāstra. He should install the mūlamantra along with the aṅga mantra and vaktra mantra and the mūrti mantra. The discriminating person should install jñānaśakti in the top [liṅga portion] as if it were a mūrti [mantra]. O Sureśvarī, or, as serving that same function, he should place the mūla mantra. One should install the kriyāśakti in the pīṭha, and she is said to have the form of a preta. 
Having installed a collection of mantras, one should give the eight puṣpikās.810 
In order that the god should remain present, one should perform various snānas. Then one should smear with candana and gandha, and kuṃkuṃ. Having done the pūjā, one should adorn the one abundant in radiance with colorful clothes. It is to be adorned with golden ornaments and one should dhūpa it with guggula and so forth. 
Having made it shine with lamps, one should give various types of naivedya. One should give all the various types of things for food and enjoyment or to be licked or even sucked and things to be drunk in giving the common, O Sundarī; otherwise, the 
809Rāmānuja, Śrībhāṣya: surākumbhasthāpanatadādhāradevapūjādika. . . . / 810An abbreviated form of worship commonly referred to in Mantramārga ritual texts but never explicitly discussed. The contents of this ritual are entirely unknown to us, though in later sources the offering of eight flowers is homologized with mental forms of worship associated with ethical and spiritual notions. 
841 
particular should be given, various sorts of naivedya along with the eighteen types of fish and sixteen types of meat. Liquors born from flowers and fruits, with liquors born from sugar cane and liquor born from flowers should be given. . . . And in the general case, one should sip always and one should wash the hands and feet. 
In regard to the particular, [in contrast] the mantrin should not sip and should not do the washing the feet and so forth.811 
Throughout this whole procedure, our text outlines two ritual tracks. In the first, the 
image is bathed in the five products of the cow in the ordinary fashion, is smeared with good 
smelling unguents, is offered perfume and dhūpa and then given nice things to eat. In the 
second, which is reserved for the most important classes of installations, the image is bathed 
in the nasty concoction contained in the hidden vessel, is smeared with five products of the 
human, and is then fed a fetid mixture of various types of liquors of different origins intermixed 
with eighteen types of fish and sixteen types of meat, including bits of human beings. Just like 
the initiated vīra both becomes an initiate and renews his commensality in the community by 
periodically consuming the vīradravya, the god is fed a similar if even more putrid form of 
caru, which is preserved within the secret pot. All of this must be done, the text tells us, “in 
order that the god should remain present.” Then, we learn that the throne upon which the god 
sits, whatever its external appearance, is in fact a preta, or animated corpse, of the sort that 
esoteric deities are often visualized as riding. It is this corpse, in fact, which is infused with

power of kriyāśakti, the agentive power that makes the liṅga function. This agentive power is 
in fact being transferred out of the secret pot, which resides in the place of the moon, and put 
into the central focus of worship, an action that, for unspecified reasons, is repeated a number 
of times over the course of the first four days of the festival. 
In just the same way that our text outlines two different registers of ritual procedures 
through which the ācārya and his artisans relate to the image in the ritual space, the 
Piṅgalāmata also presents us with two distinctive registers of festival “entertainments” that 
are connected to each other conceptually on the basis of hidden commonalities. It is certainly 
no accident that our text introduces these two us immediately following the discussion of ritual 
registers we have just been wrestling with: 
One should let four days pass with festivals of song and dance and with the sounding of bells and ḍamarus. Offering flowers, dhūpa, naivedya, betel, and so forth, [the event continues] with celestial festivals day and night. . . . 
At night, there is bestowing of the awakening performance [jāgran] with dance and song and instrumental music. In regard to the general [i.e., the non-transgressive procedure], one should only do those festivals during the day. By day, the sattra is to not to be stopped. One should donate to the poor and orphans. 
Then, in the particular, [at night,] [the giving of feasts] it is carried out among the vīras and the yoginīs and the kārukas. And at nighttime and at the end of the day, one should make use of the food and drink to be enjoyed by the vīras and so forth. The festival with the song and dance along with instruments is during the daytime.812 
Our passage is pointing out another hidden homology, one which invites us to re- 
engage with the philanthropic dimensions of the pratiṣṭhā festival from a new perspective. Just 
as the casual instrumental and musical performances that occur during the day are matched by 
812Piṅgalāmata: gītanṛtyotsavair devi ghaṇṭāḍamarunāditaiḥ // divārātrotsavair divyair nayed dinacatuṣṭayaṃ / puṣpadhūpādinaivedyatāmbūlādipradānataḥ // sāmānye vācamen nityaṃ hastapādādikṣālanaṃ / viśeṣe nācamen maṃtrīn na śauce caraṇādikaṃ // yato dvyarthaṃ ca sāmānyaṃ dvaitādvaitavidur budhāḥ / viśeṣaikārthasaṃjñeyaṃ kevalādvaitalakṣaṇaṃ // rātrau jāgaradānaṃ ca geyanṛtyais tu vāditaiḥ / mahotsavair dināny eva sāmānye vātha kārayet // divā’nivāritasatraṃ dīnānāthaṃ ca dāpayet / viśeṣaṃ cet tadā vīrair yoginīkārukaiḥ saha // vīrabhojyānnapānādyaṃ divānte niśi vācaret / nṛtyageyasavādyaiś ca dināny evaṃ mahotsavaṃ // 
843 
jāgran rituals, where vigil is kept and songs are sung compelling the goddess to awaken, the 
ceaseless feeding of the poor and desperate that goes on during the day has its counterpart in 
the distribution and ritual consumption of the vīradravya, for these two acts are in fact the very 
same kind of experience instantiated in different material substrates according to their native 
propensities. The quotidian celebrations during the daytime are in turn in some fundamental 
sense non-different from the krīḍā, comprised of sexual rites and the consumption of 
transgressive substances by an assembly of human vīras, artisans, and yoginīs, as well as their 
non-human counterparts, which takes the form of a raucous feast conducted by very intoxicated 
people dancing, singing, and displaying their bodies to the beat of the ḍamaru. The poor and 
desperate in some sense are simply the yoginīs and gods in disguise and the charity they are 
given, in a surreptitious fashion, obeys the same logic as the empowering nectar of the clan. 
It is in its discussion of the rituals for the fourth day, which outline one last secret ritual, 
that the Piṅgalāmata finally shows the discerning reader how all the pieces fit together. Here, 
the focus is what is to be done with the ritual leftovers, called the nirmālya, that have been 
offered to the god. Usually, when we talk about nirmālya—or, what do you do with god’s 
leftovers—scholarly conversations fixate on the question of purity to the exclusion of pretty 
much anything else. But much as is the case when it comes to our thinking about caste, which 
also tends to be framed as a discourse about purity at the expense of all other considerations, 
what should we do with nirmālya is at the same time very much a sociological question. It is 
inextricably tied to issues of social agency, spatialized hierarchy, power, and questions of 
inclusion and exclusion—even fundamental issues of human well-being. Quite literally, the 
question of “what do we do with leftovers” translates into who gets to eat. Should the resources 
that have been invested in the day-to-day operations of the ritual life of a temple complex be 
844 
taken out of circulation, or will they get redistributed, to the benefit of wider publics? As we 
are beginning to recognize, the question of nirmālya is of crucial relevance to the political 
economy of Śaiva communities. What we are about to discover is that these very same political 
economies are fundamentally shaped by the precise contours of different Śaiva religious 
imaginaries and their pantheons. At the heart of this question is the contested role of the god 
Caṇḍeśvara, to whom the nirmālya is offered. As we have encountered before in our 
excavation of Kāruka doxographies and their misplaced scriptural canons, Caṇḍeśvara has a 
persistent affiliation with śilpins and Kāruka religious imaginaries. 
Thus, while in classical Śaiva literature, nirmālya, having been touched and tasted by 
god, is considered radically impure and must be disposed of, the śilpin aligned Piṅgalāmata 
approaches this issue from a vastly different perspective: 
On the arriving of the fourth day, the cumbaka is well prepared. Having determined the strength and weaknesses of the substances [to be offered], the discriminating one, along with the mūrtipas and the help, should offer the homa on the fourth day. 
It is one hundred or otherwise one thousand oblations; [the substances consist of] those that are lickable, suckable and other food offerings. Having taken away everything, and likewise taken away the pūjā [implements], the naivedya is to be given to virgins who are children of sons and brothers [of the sponsor] and to young ladies, both those who are orphaned and in trouble. For the sake of the support of the learned, divyapuṣpa should be given for the sake of eating.813 
In other words, any normal food that has been offered to the god is fed to human girls, 
while the caru concoction is given to the initiates to be consumed as vīradravya. What we have 
here, in essence, is a maximally redistributive economy. Like the stereotypical—and at least a 
little bit racist—floating trope about how the first people of the North American plains made 
813Piṅgalāmata: caturthe ‘hani samprāpte cumbakaḥ susamāhitaḥ / caturthī homayet prājño jñātvā dravyabalābalaṃ // śataṃ vātha sahasram vā mūrtipaiḥ saha saṃyutaḥ / naivedyabhakṣyabhojyāni lehyacoṣyāṇi yāni tu // sarvāpanayanaṃ kṛtvā pūjāpanayanaṃ tathā / kumāryo bhrātṛputrāṇāṃ yuvatyo ‘nāthadukhyatāḥ // naivedyaṃ ca pradātavyaṃ bhakṣaṇāya na saṃśayaḥ / divyapuṣpaṃ pradātavyaṃ dhāraṇāya vipaścitā // 
845 
use of the buffalo, every little bit of nirmālya is used and nothing is wasted. We can begin to 
get a sense of just how unusual such an arrangement might be vis-à-vis other Śaiva systems by 
juxtaposing the Piṅgalāmata’s discussion of the nirmālya disposal process with an extensive 
passage on the same topic drawn from the Jñānaratnāvali, a Siddhāntika paddhati composed 
in Varanasi in the thirteenth century. As Dominic Goodall has shown in a wide-ranging study 
of the god Caṇḍeśvara that incorporates the following translation, here, the Śaiva Siddhānta 
theologian Jñānaśambhu builds upon the Somaśambhupaddhati and a range of other medieval 
sources with uncommon clarity.814 
Whatever fierce and terrible evil may have been generated by transgressing the rules by those who venerate Śiva, the one who is responsible for removing that is taught to be Caṇḍeśvara. Outside, in the North-Eastern direction, in a maṇḍala of cow-dung that is half-moon-shaped he should build a lotus[-throne] with [the base] Ananta, [the four throne-legs of] Dharma, Jñāna, Vairāgya and Aiśvarya, [and the seat that is an open] lotus, using the praṇava [as a mantra]. He should venerate this throne with [the mantra] OṂ CAṆḌĀSANĀYA HUṂPHAṆṆAMAḤ. 
Above that, with [the mūrtimantra, namely] OṂ CAṆḌAMŪRTAYE HUṂPHAṆṆAMAḤ, he should visualise the form [of the deity] as having the colour of black collyrium, four-faced, twelve-eyed, with snakes for his sacred thread and for his upper armbands, with flames of fierce fire emerging from his mouth, bright with a fiery-flamed crescent moon, very terrible, four-armed, with trident and water-pot on the left and with axe and rosary on the right, arisen from the fire of Rudra[’s anger], and he should then (param) invite [Caṇḍeśa] using his root mantra. . . . 
With the ‘cow-mudrā’, he should effect the transformation into nectar, and with the [above-given] heart-mantra he should offer foot-water, water for sipping, etc. He should venerate [Caṇḍeśa] together with his aṅgamantras arrayed around him (bhogāṅgopetam) with fragrances and such like [offerings], perform as much recitation as he is able, and then, with [recitation of] the syllable OM. he should announce: 
Apart from cattle, land, gold, cloths and such, ornaments of jewels and gold and such, all else that has been offered and enjoyed [by Śiva] (śeṣaṃ nirmālyam) one should give to Caṇḍeśa. Whatever can be licked, sucked, chewed or drunk, betel, garlands, unguents—all such things that have been offered and enjoyed [by Śiva] are given to you by Śiva’s command. 
814Dominic Goodall, “Who is Caṇḍeśa?” in Genesis and Development of Tantrism, ed. Shingoo Einoo (Tokyo: Institute of Oriental Culture, 2009), 351–424. 
846 
After reciting this, he should offer what has been offered and enjoyed by Śiva, saying OṂ O Caṇḍa, all this ritual, if, because of ignorance, I have performed it deficiently or adding something, then let it be rendered perfect by your command. . . . 
Thus [the teaching to be found] in the Sarvajñānottara: One should know that those scents, flowers and food-offerings made to the God who has [since] been invited to depart are nirmālya. [In other words, everything offered to the God is nirmālya] excepting clothing and ornaments. After giving him guest-water, one should once again offer [those offerings] to Caṇḍeśa.” 
Surely[,] in the case of a bāṇaliṅga, a portable one, ones that have risen [from rivers], one established by a Siddha, a spontaneously arisen one and in the case of all [representational] images, Caṇḍa has no authority. [So too] in the case of one in which there is visualisation of a non-dual [deity such as Bhairava or Tumburu]. And also in the case of rites for the Lord [installed] on the ground. Others, however, [opine:] No worship of Caṇḍa [is to be performed] when the [image of] the Lord has been crafted either. 
How can [such a view as] that [be maintained]? True. [But] this is [in fact] a prohibition of the installation of Caṇḍa and not a prohibition of his worship. This is advanced as somebody else’s doctrine. In the Saiva Siddhānta, however, the rule is that he should always and in every case be worshipped. 
And this is expressed in the Kālottara: Whether the liṅga is stable or portable, or made of precious stone, clay, wood, rock, iron, or is represented in a picture, or is a bāṇaliṅga, [the worship of] Caṇḍa remains determined by rule (niyāmakaḥ) in the Siddhānta, but not in other tantric traditions: neither in the Vāmasrotas nor in the Dakṣiṇasrotas. Those who enjoy what belongs to Caṇḍa, what belongs to the guru or what belong to the God, [even] in thought, are cooked in [the hell called] Raurava.815 
When the Jñānaratnāvali speaks polemically of “someone else’s” doctrine allowing 
certain conditions, such as a liṅga where the lakṣaṇas do not have to be raised, the worship of 
a non-dual deity, or even in regard to crafted images of the lord, that nirmālya can be consumed 
or that it can offered in the absence of Caṇḍa, the “other” of which he speaks is almost certainly 
the tradition represented by our Piṅgalāmata. For a Siddhāntika, its teachings at every level 
must have seemed appalling. Just as the Śaiva Siddhānta sources speak of transmutation of the 
products of the cow into nectar, our text speaks of the human meat and the substances with 
815Goodall, “Who is Caṇḍeśa?” 363–365. 
847which it travels becoming nectar when they are offered to the god. While our text presents 
offerings that are “lickable, suckable, and other food offerings” as an auspicious meal for 
young girls, in the Siddhānta sources, “whatever can be licked, sucked, chewed” and so forth 
are included in the catalog of things forbidden to humans. Caṇḍeśvara plays a key but delimited 
role in each Siddhānta ritual, consuming the nirmālya and punishing transgressors. Except for 
“clothing and ornaments,” for the Siddhānta, everything used in ritual becomes nirmālya. This 
effectively renders ritual an expensive potlatch in which almost everything in the rite is made 
useless. In contrast, our text proffers a diametrically opposed understanding. 
There is nothing designated as nirmālya, for the rite is without Caṇḍeśvara. 
Therefore, with regard to either the consumption or even the wearing of nirmālya, this practice is without fault. With regard to the giving and or receiving it, this is how things work in the case of the general ritual, O One with Good Observances. If, however, you are in the presence of the special ritual elements, therefore those elements are more dear; exceptionally pure. Since she [the śakti] is present within the caru for [certain] souls, there is the bestowal of siddhi and mukti according to the doctrine. [Therefore,] having wiped it [with] that, having bathed the god as is suitable with various sorts of fragrant water, following the injunctions previously indicated and as suitable, with one’s own substances, the one who is well prepared should do pūjā.816 
Here, the Piṅgalāmata presents in sequence a series of rather audacious, almost 
lawyerly, assertions. First, it tells us, because at this point, Caṇḍeśvara is not present on the 
ritual grounds, (though, as we will see, he will be arriving rather soon), there can by definition 
be no nirmālya—everything used in the general ritual can therefore be used and distributed as 
the ritualists see fit. When it comes to the things we would consider even more charged with 
transgressive power and thus by almost any standard ritually impure, our Śākta Tantra 
proclaims that these too can be used by and distributed among suitable recipients. Since the 
816Piṅgalāmata: na nirmālyaṃ vinirdiṣṭa yataś caṇḍeśvaram vinā / ato nirdoṣam evoktaṃ bhakṣaṇe dhāraṇe ‘pi vā // dāne vā grahaṇe cāpi sāmānyaṃ vātha suvrate / viśeṣasannidhau yasmāt tasmāt pretatarāstu te // siddhimuktikarāṇubhyaś caruke ca yathā matā / tatsammārjanaṃ kṛtvā snāpya devaṃ yathocitaṃ // vividhaiḥ pūrvanirdiṣṭaiḥ gandhatoyādibhiḥ priye / yathocitātmabhir dravyaiḥ pūjayet susamāhitaḥ // 
848 
caru is suffused with the śakti who bestows liberation on vīras who are consumers of the 
vīradravya, it too must be considered intrinsically pure. It is only on the last day of the ritual, 
before the installing of the image or mūrti in its piṇḍikā, that Caṇḍeśvara is integrated into the 
ritual field. Suddenly, the Piṅgalāṃata cannot simply deploy logical loopholes to exploit a 
technicality that treats ritual offerings under special circumstances as not really a kind of 
nirmālya and therefore fit for use. Instead, it has to make a more pointed argument that the 
very idea of nirmālya—that human beings are not fit recipients for god’s leftovers—is itself 
illegitimate. In order to arrive at that destination, the text first has to introduce us to the god 
Caṇḍeśvara. 
In the liṅga, or in the mūrti, one should set down Caṇḍa. Caṇḍa is famous for being the anger of god. Having meditated on him as arising from that, his jñānamūrti, [installed] inside oneself, is as follows. He has fangs and a fierce face. He is horrific to behold with flames for matted locks. He is pure white like the autumn moon. This is the Krodhacaṇḍa who has come forth. . . . Maheśa himself, although he has no form, has come to a form. 
Having contemplated Caṇḍarudra, who is the anger that has emerged from god, having unfastened him, from out of the liṅga, conjoined with the samḥāramudrā, he inserts him through the medium of a flower, O Deveśa. He should take him again from the pīṭha and installs him in the īśāna domain [eastern direction]. 
She is that śakti called Endless (Ananta) whose form is moving and unmoving. She is to be seen in the form of a vessel (pātra). She has the form of the seat of Caṇḍa. Having fashioned his seat in the beginning one should invite the Caṇḍamūrti. 
[His mantra is as follows]: oṃ at the beginning and namaḥ at the end and a mantra called kṣa along with the visarga [in the middle.] The mūrti mantra [kṣauṃ] has been taught; the āsana mantra would be the same. [oṃ kṣaḥ namaḥ / kṣāṃ hṛdaya / kṣīṃ / kṣaṃ / The mūrti mantra is kṣauṃ]. With that itself [the same mantra] with the long vowels, one should fashion the six component-mantra. Conjoined with short vowels, one should fashion the five faces. The mūla mantra is kṣaum; that itself is the supreme Caṇḍeśvara 
And in that place, with a black form, very radiant with four hands, [the physical image is to be installed]. However, he is to be meditated on, O god of gods, as previously [according to the jñānadhyāna] that which is constructed emerging out of Śiva. Having 
849 
worshipped with scents and flowers, one should fix him there with the kavaca and weapon mantra.817 
The Piṅgalāmata’s own concluding discussion of the use of Caṇḍeśvara and his 
mantras in ritual provides us with some insights that cannot be gleaned from our other sources. 
Succinctly, what the text adds to our inquiry is a throughgoing ritualization and spatialization 
of the general ethos we been exploring earlier in our study of dual understandings, such as 
when secular festival fun and acts of charity were secretly encoding the feeding of the yoginīs. 
In this case however, what is being hidden in plain sight is that the apparent main focus of 
worship—the temple being consecrated—is in actuality itself merely a placeholder for its 
secret counterpart. The “real temple” is in fact a second hidden space where Caṇḍeśvara 
himself is to be installed that directly replicates the dimensions of the main site of worship. As 
for the space in question, it is none other than the secret chamber of the moon. In much the 
same spirit, at the level of ritual procedure, all of the other ritual actions during the five day 
festival are in actuality secretly being empowered by the mantra system of the 
caṇḍabrahmamantras.818 In short, the Piṅgalāmata teaches that the real sacred heart of a 
Kālamukha ritual center is the exclusive place where the artisans and their guru perform their 
own worship—in the secret space of the moon—where Caṇḍeśvara, the lord of the universe, 
817Piṅgalāmata: liṅge mūrtau nyasec caṇḍaṃ caṇḍakrodheti viśrutaḥ / taduttham iti taṃ dhyātvā jñānamūrtyātmagā tu yā // jvalajaṭāladuṣprekṣe daṃṣṭrālo vikṛtānanaḥ / śaratkundendudhavalaṃ krodhacaṇḍo viniḥsṛtaḥ //. . . . svayam eva maheśas tu amūrtau mūrtim āgataḥ / vicintya caṇḍarudraṃ tu krodhaṃ devād vinirgataḥ // tam utkīlya ca tatsthāne liṅgād īśe niveśayet / sapuṣpeṇaiva deveśa mudrāsaṃhārakena tu // niveśyaivaṃ punar bhūyaḥ pīṭhād īśe ca kalpayet / anantākhyā tu yā śaktiḥ sā calācalarūpiṇī // pātrarūpā ca draṣṭavyā caṇḍasyāsanarūpiṇī / tadāsanaprakalpyādau caṇḍamūrtiṃ niveśayet // savisargakṣa-ākhyena oṃ namaś cādir antataḥ / mūrtimantrasamuddiṣṭaḥ kevalaṃ svāsanaṃ bhavet // oṃ kṣaḥ namaḥ / kṣāṃ hṛdaya / kṣīṃ / kṣaṃ sadyo / tad eva svaradīrghais tu ṣaḍaṅgāni prakalpayet / svarai hrasvaiḥ prayuktaṃ tu pañcavaktraṃ ca kalpayet / kṣaum iti mūlamantras tu svayaṃ caṇḍeśvaraṃ paraṃ / tatsthāne kṛṣṇarūpaṃ tu catuḥkarasubhāsuraṃ // dhyātavyaṃ devadeveśe pūrvaṃ vai śivanirmitaṃ / gandhapuṣpādibhiḥ pūjya taddharmāstreṇa rodhayet // 818Diwakar Acharya has already observed this same dynamic. “According to the Śivopaniṣad [a redaction of the Śivadharmaśāstra] and the Pratiṣṭhālakṣaṇasārasamuccaya, it is necessary to erect a shrine of Caṇḍeśvara of the same size as the inner sanctum of the main temple and install an image of the deity alongside almost each and every public temple of Śiva.” Diwakar Acharya, “The Role of Caṇḍa in the Early History of the Pāśupata Cult and the Image on the Mathura Pillar Dated Gupta Year 61,” Indo-Iranian Journal 48, no. 3–4 (2005): 216. 
850 
is placed in union with his beloved consort, who has assumed the form of the very vessel in 
which the vīradravya is contained. 
Having done the homa then, then after there is the fashioning of Caṇḍeśvara. One should look in his direction, repeatedly again in the vicinity of the end of the prākāra. [At the place of the moon,] one should fashion the room/receptacle (āgāra), which is made of bricks or otherwise from stone or made of dāru wood or made of clay. It should be kept secret. But that śakti mentioned previously who is ādhāra (the base), one should conceive of her as being fixed [in that space]. 
Having first fashioned his seat, one should install Caṇḍa, well established, on top of that. Having installed Caṇḍa, having sipped, one should do the homa for expiation. Having had the deity bathed, again, one should sacrifice the common offering to the liṅga.819 
When it is done for that purpose, then there is separation from him. For one’s own sake or in regard to the particular form of the rite, Caṇḍeśvara is not there. And one should not at all do craft fashioning that is [not] arising for him or separated from him. For Bhairava is said to be the liṅga itself—he is installed because of him being Bhairava/causing fear. However, a place is fashioned because of it being the place for nirmālya. 
Indeed, in regard to one’s own yāga, there is no [presence of] Caṇḍeśvara. You should not avoid [the use of Caṇḍeśvaras] in the case of special rites or the fourth homa [at night]. For this reason, the fault born of nirmālya does not exist in that context, O One with Good Observances. Naivedya, bhakṣya, and bhojyānna, gandha, puṣpa, and so forth, all those things without remainder—there is not ever any nirmālya that arises. In such cases, from giving [offerings to the god] away or stepping on it, there is no fault accruing to you from Caṇḍeśvara [so far as he is concerned].820 
819The NGMP manuscript here inserts three verses discussing the tri-fold division of the liṅga into Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Rudra bhāgas as well as a prose stanza on generic Śaiva mantras. This seems an obvious digression from the matter at hand and has not been included in the working edition. Perhaps it was caused by someone copying palm leaf folios out of order, especially as virtually identical verses appear in A and the British Library manuscript in a more appropriate place right after the discussion of Caṇḍeśvara has finished. 820Piṅgalāmata: homaṃ kṛtvā tataḥ paścāc caṇḍeśvaravikalpanā / taddiśāvalokayed bhūyaḥ prākārasyāntasannidhau / āgāraṃ kalpayet tatra aiṣṭaṃ vāpy atha śailajaṃ / dārujaṃ mṛnmayaṃ vātha suguptaṃ caiva kārayet // prāg ādhārā tu yā śaktiḥ sthiratvaṃ tatra kalpayet / tadāsanaṃ prakalpyādau nyasec caṇḍaṃ tu susthitaṃ // sthāpya caṇḍaṃ samācamya prāyaścittaṃ tu homayet / snāpayitvā punar devaṃ liṅge sādhāraṇaṃ yajet // sādhāraṇaṃ ca vaktrāṇi ṣaḍaṅgāni prakalpayet / sādhāraṇaṃ trayo devā tribhāge tu vikalpayet //. . . . ātmārthe vā viśeṣe vā tadā caṇḍeśvaraṃ na hi / tadarthaṃ tadviyogaṃ vai kalpanā naiva kārayet // bhairavaṃ liṅgam evoktaṃ bhairavatvāt pratiṣṭhitaṃ / kiṃtu sthānaṃ prakalpīta nirmālyasthānahetukaṃ // kiṃtu caṇḍeśvaro no vā svayāge varjanaṃ ca tat / na varjayed viśeṣaṃ ca homaṃ cāturthakaṃ na hi // ato nirmālyajo doṣo na bhavet tatra suvrate / naivedyabhakṣyabhojyāni gandhapuṣpāṇi yāni tu // tāny aśeṣaṃ sadā vāpi na nirmālyaṃ ca nodbhavaṃ / caṇḍeśvarasya te naiva na doṣo dānalaṅghane // 
851 
In a similar spirit, all appearances to the contrary, here the text reveals that whatever 
their external nature, all the liṅgas—iconic or aniconic—installed following the procedures 
outlined in the Piṅgalāmata are actually forms of Bhairava, for they are animated by his 
mantras. Already in the late eighth century when it was composed, the Piṅgalāmata, having 
internalized some of the rhetoric of the Śaiva Siddhānta sources, feels the need to respond to 
the accusation that the consumption or mishandling of the nirmālya, be it in the form of objects, 
garlands of flowers, or food, does not constitute a violation of the samaya of the Tantric adept 
or bear negative karmic consequences and that the worship of Caṇḍeśvara as more than just a 
glorified garbage disposal is a legitimate activity. Under this veneer, however, persists a much 
more archaic logic—associated quite specifically with the part of the Piṅgalāmata’s 
portmanteau, a patrimony that it received from the Vāma Tantras, evocative of a time in 
formative antecedents of the tradition when Śākta worship was conducted in much less rarefied 
venues. The skeleton key to unlocking antecedents of our text within an older cremation ground 
culture is the Piṅgalāmata’s choice of the rather uncommon word “āgāra,” which our text uses 
in referring to the separate structure in the domain of the moon where Caṇḍeśvara and his śakti 
reside in the form of black image and pot. Though our text is never explicit, it is the āgāra and 
not the garbhagṛha that is the real locus and source of ontic power within the ritual complex, 
for indeed everything that makes the public deity ritually and juridically empowered is 
dependent upon the hidden god Caṇḍa and his consort the all-pervasive goddess. Now, in the 
Picumata Brahmayāmala, from which as we have seen the Piṅgalāmata descends, albeit 
through a number of mostly lost intermediaries, “the term devāgāra seems to refer to a 
852 
temporary yāgasthāna or maṇḍala rather than a temple or shrine.”821 This space, usually 
situated in a cremation ground, is where most Kāpālika style worship was conducted. 
As has been discussed at some length by Csaba Kiss in his study and translation of the 
Picumata Brahmayāmala’s third, twenty-first, and forty-fifth chapter, the elaborate maṇḍala 
of the Picumata is to be drawn and venerated within the space called the āgāra during rites of 
initiation (dīkṣā) and at the time of mahāyāga, but also, though the subject has yet to receive a 
detailed treatment, “at the time of image-installation (pratiṣṭhā).”822 During this pantheon 
worship, as is outlined in chapter 3 of the Brahmayāmala,823 after measuring out and plotting 
an elaborate geometric figure using a thread and then chalk, the mantrin draws upon the ground 
the nine cremation grounds (Vārāṇasī, Virajā, Kollagiri, Prabhāsa, Ujjainī, Bhūteśvara, 
Ekāmraka, Koṭivarṣa, and Prayāga in the center), invoking into them their respective deities 
with their retinues, followed by the protectors of the directions and the one hundred rudras. 
Each of this last class of beings is drawn on the ground, presumably using powder or chalk, 
mounted of corpses, bearing khaṭvāṅgas, and wearing garlands of human heads. The four 
goddesses (Raktā, Karālī, Caṇḍākṣī, Mahocchuṣmā) who surround the central Kapālīśa 
Bhairava at Prayāga are then to be worshipped. This is done by feeding them “cow’s blood and 
821Tantrābhidhānakośa, vol. 3, 96–97: devāgāra, n.nt. [O], demeure de divinité ; temple, house of a deity; Tempel, Haus einer Gottheit. 1. Syn. of devakula*. 2. [A] The term devāgāra in the PB Y seems to refer to a temporary yāgasthāna or maṇḍala* rather than a temple or shrine. This can be inferred from an enigmatic list of the deities that the tālaka* should venerate when he enters the devāgāra to start his prescribed rituals (see PBY[H] 45.189ff.). The list, which mentions two doorkeepers, two rivers, Sivâ, Mañjārī, Ulūka etc., is probably intended to hint at the cult's central maṇḍala, taught in PBY ch. 3. Also, PBY 18 gives an instruction to (mentally?) construct a devāgara in the centre of the maṇḍala: madhye tu bhramanasyaiva devāgāram prakalpayet | (bhramanasya for brahmasthānasya or for the passageways [vīthis] around the centre of the mandalal). This makes it unlikely that an ordinary temple is meant. [Cs.K.] This use of an expression commonly used for a temple elsewhere to refer to what is not a temple may have been influenced by the expression agnyādga (the tālaka* goes back and forth between the devāgāra and the agnyāgra in PBY[H] 45).

flesh (palala) with wine and some fermenting agent (surākiṇva),” after which there is “food 
offering (nivedayet),” according to the rule (yathānyāyaṃ).824 Under normal circumstances, 
here the naivedya is comprised of “wine (surā), rum (śīdhu), liquor. . . [meat], raw and cooked. 
. . of goats and buffaloes, the flesh of fish. . . and well-cooked mung beans.”825 Much as we 
find in Vajrayāna rituals, especially those associated with the Yoga Tantras, the maṇḍala is 
then illuminated by eight lamps made of “human skulls and filled with human fat” arranged in 
the cardinal and intermediate directions. 
At this point in the Brahmayāmala’s ritual system point, the practitioner, his body 
empowered by the avadhūtā mantras, steps into the center of the field. Becoming Bhairava, he 
makes a bali offering—it is entirely unclear whether the victim should always be an animal or 
is sometimes human—to the four goddesses. Entering into the victim’s body by means of 
parakāyapraveśa, the Kāpālika snatches up the five elements (pañcabhūta) and extracts them 
from the victim. Returning to his own body, these he now feeds to the goddesses, with Raktā 
receiving the blood, Karālī the meat, Caṇḍākṣī the skin, and Mahocchuṣmā the marrow, and 
Bhairava himself the fat. The ritualist then ventures out from the āgāra and goes to worship 
the fire. Though in this case the blood offering belongs to a surrogate, elsewhere in the related 
ritual corpus, for example the Siddhayogeśvarīmata, it is the sādhaka himself who cuts the left 
side of his body—especially the left arm—making ārgha to the goddess using his own blood. 
In the case of the great yāga (mahāyāga), however, following the general ritual, another 
step is added that is of much interest for our analysis. Here, once the pantheon has been fed, a 
noxious mix called caru, made up of all the nasty things used in the rite, is now prepared to be 
offered as naivedya to all the gods and goddesses. Whatever is not offered to other beings is 
824Kiss, The Brahmayāmalatantra of Picumata, vol. II, 202–203. 825Kiss, The Brahmayāmalatantra of Picumata, vol. II, 203. 
854 
brought out of the āgāra and into the area where fire is prepared where it is immolated as food 
for the yoginīs. During this time, “the teacher (ācārya), together with the pupils, should eat the 
supreme Caru, mixed with urine. . . . He should eat the divine Caru if he strives for powers 
(siddhi) for himself. . . . Then he should perform fire-offerings and make the Caru. . . 
Meditating on [the state of] freedom from conventional practices. . . the Sādhaka should join 
with Him [i.e. Bhairava]. When he has been united [with Him], he should eat the Caru.”826 The 
modification of this ritual ectype prescribed for the generic sādhaka contributes further 
pertinent details. For here, twice a day as part of regular ritual, the adept is supposed to worship 
a vessel full of wine, contained within a skull or conch shell. 
When the underlying symbolism of ritual installation as sexual union about which the 
Piṅgalāmata is so emphatic is taken into account, an even closer match is to be found in the 
rites of the sādhaka called the tālaka. 
The Master of Rituals should proceed to the sanctuary (devāgāra). He should worship the two door-keepers, the two rivers and the bull, Vighneśa. . . Kṣetrapāla, and the Cremation Grounds, the Kula-vidyā, the Yoginīs, the Pūtanās etc. Then the Mantra Master should worship the Heroes (vīra), and Śivā, and Mārjāri (śivamārjāri), the Ulūka-owl and Piṅgalā. . . one by one. He should praise the Rudras and the lineage of gurus properly. . . . 
[In the case of the procedure for those seeking supreme power,] he should enter the sancturary (devāgāra) by the aforementioned method. Naked, his hair dishevelled, his mantric installation rituals (nyāsa) definitively performed, he should sit down on the Praṇava-throne after [the performance of the worship] of the pantheon in his heart. . . . 
Facing south, he should install a small seat. He should construct a throne (āsana) there with mantras as the next step. The Mantra Master should make the Śakti [his human consort] sit down on the throne, O Mahādevī. The excellent Sādhaka should purify her Pīṭha [i.e. her genitalia]. . . . He should install his own pantheon there [i.e. on her genitalia] after the throne etc. [has been visualized there]. He should kiss and embrace her, even [kiss her] Pīṭha. . . . 
He should insert his penis after the throne etc. [has been constructed for her]. He should then unite the all-pervading with flowers, perfumes etc. He should then stimulate

855 
(kṣobhayitvā) the Śakti, collecting the fluids arising from her. He should consume [some of] the fluids (dravya) turning them into the guest offering (argha). He should offer it. . . . Then the Mantrin should besprinkle the materials. . . with water purified by the [sexual] fluids (dravya). He should construct a small maṇḍala, O Goddess, with sandal-powder etc. [and] wine [and] distilled spirits mixed with cow-dung or menstrual blood that has been discharged previously. Śiva’s vase [should be] filled with wine properly, or with water purified by fluids, my dear. . . . Then, he should worship the pantheon on lotuses (padmayāga) following the rules. 
The Mantrin should then go to the fire site (agnyāgāra) [and] present libations. . . show mudrās, give guest-offerings. . . and present the food offerings (naivedya). . . Laḍḍukā cakes. . . and [other kinds of] foods made in a saucepan, as well as fragrant meat and fermented spirituous liquors. He should then show mudrās after the [worship of] the pantheon in his heart. . . . The Mantra Master. . . should present guest offerings. . . . 
Then he should prostrate himself, holding the conch[/skull] as he likes, and after he has received permission [from the guru]. he should move [the beads on] his rosary. The Mantra Master should move [the beads of the rosary], perform [the worship of the pantheon] in his heart, and then go in front of the Pīṭha [throne/genitalia] of the Śakti who is abiding with him. . . . 
The Sādhaka should kiss and embrace her, and insert his penis there [in her vagina]. He should cleanse that place as his next step, [and perform] pantheon-worship in the heart. The excellent Sādhaka, the Mantrin, should then place it in his heart by method of samādhi, [then place it] in the centre of bindu constructed with the pantheon etc. Beholding the whole pantheon, his heart offered to Bhairava, he should do recitation.827 
Though the Piṅgalāmata’s sources are likely later scriptures within the tradition that 
offer their own refinements, it would seem that much of what is most inexplicable about the 
logic of our text’s pratiṣṭhā rituals can be accounted for when we recognize that their structure 
is indebted to this more archaic register of praxis. Before there were wider publics sharing 
space with the ritualists, the sādhakas simply fed their retinue, the gods, and the yoginīs. Before 
there were two shrines, the garbhagṛha and the āgāra, between which the ritualist and his 
retinue ran back and forth inexplicably each time having to manage the clandestine transport 
of vessel full of liquor and meat, there was only the agnyāgāra and the temporary devāgāra. 
Positioned in close proximity to each other, the sādhaka would complete his rituals within the 
827Kiss, The Brahmayāmalatantra of Picumata, vol. II, 256–257, 263–265. 
856 
sanctuary and then deposit whatever remained of transgressive substances into the awaiting 
fire. When liṅga and yoni were not made of inexhaustible stone penetrating inexhaustible stone 
and the transfer of energies and fluids between the spaces sometimes incorporated human 
discharges, ritual had to be a multiday affair to accommodate the human refractory period and 
the biological reality of a limited daily production of the sacred substances. It is this persistent 
homology that also explains the otherwise rather bizarre, repeated insistence in our text on the 
extraction of energies and stuff out of the liṅga, out of the pātra, and their repeated insertion 
into the pīṭha and the top liṅga within the garbhagṛha. As for the Piṅgalāmata’s discourse on 
nirmālya, in part this may well be a carryover from the Brahmayāmala’s chapter on uchuṣma 
vrata—also called the dirty observance (maline vrate), where the wearing and use of elements 
offered to the god in ritual forms part of a delimited vow and is justified, much in the same 
spirit we saw in the Śivadharma, by the claim that adepts belonging to the caste of the gods 
(devajāti) should not reject the nirmālya when it is offered to them. 
Our Piṅgalāmata’s indebtedness to even older strains within the Atimārga mediated 
through the cult of the goddess Vāgeśvarī and the lord called Caṇḍeśvara become ever more 
readily apparent as one begins to look under surface. Since the mid 1990s, we have seen a 
series of lively exchanges within the philological study of the Śaiva Tantras exploring the 
curious place which the god Caṇḍeśvara occupies within Śaiva discourse.828 Over the course 
of this conversation, what began as essentially a study of iconography aimed at securing precise 
identifications of particular early images has evolved into a consideration of the heterogeneity 
828The discussion begins with Diwakar Acharya’s essay, which proposed, quite insightfully, that the god Caṇḍa/Caṇḍeśvara is a pre-Pāśupata deity. Peter Bisschop responded by demonstrating the existence of a corpus of non-Saiddhāntika images of the deity and finally Dominic Goodall produced the minature monograph on Caṇḍeśa which we have have been drawing upon throughout this section. Acharya, “The Role of Caṇḍa in the Early History of the Pāśupata Cult”; Peter Bisschop, “Once Again of the Identity of Caṇḍeśvara in Early Śaivism,” Indo-Iranian Journal 53, no. 3 (2010): 233–249; Goodall, “Who is Caṇḍeśa.” 
857of early Śaiva communities and their doctrine, particularly lost sub-branches within the 
Atimārga. Initially, scholarship had assumed that Caṇḍeśvara was solely a somewhat minor 
south Indian Saiddhāntika deity. Confined to a small shrine to the northeast of the temple where 
he resided in a dwarf liṅga, his ritual role was simply to receive and consume the nirmālya at 
the end of festivals or pūjā. It was only once serious textual work on early Pāśupata traditions 
resulted in the discomforting discovery that Lakulīśa/Lāguḍa, typically imagined as the iconic 
instantiation of Pāśūpata values, is actually absent from most of our sources and that in reality 
many of the early images scholars had been labelling Lakulīśa in fact depict Caṇḍa, whose 
iconography the Pāśupata teacher would later appropriate, that the importance of reassessing 
Caṇḍeśvara’s changing role in this religious imaginary began to become clear. Diwakar 
Acharya appears to have been the first to propose that Caṇḍeśvara’s humble status in south 
Indian circles occludes a more illustrious past. He writes: 
“Caṇḍa was a pre-Lakulīśa deity accepted in all schools of the Pāśupatas. Afterwards he was downgraded to a minor deity but remained in Śaiva temples as one of Śiva’s gaṇas. According to the Śivopaniṣad and Pratiṣṭhālakṣaṇasārasamuccaya, it is necessary to erect shrine of Caṇḍeśvara of the same size as the inner sanctum of the main temple and install an image of the deity alongside almost each and every public temple of Śiva. This phenomenon can be taken as an attempt of Saiddhāntikas to subjugate the supreme deity of the Pāśupatas in the subsequent phase of Śaivism.829 
In a piece where he reevaluates a famous image identified as Lakulīśa and his disciples 
now housed at the British Museum as in fact representing Caṇḍeśvara, Peter Bisschop draws 
our attention to additional textual and material cultural evidence related to the early roots of 
the deity. Significantly, these include two images in Bādāmi Caḷukya ritual sites at Mahakuta 
and Pattadakal. Bisschop suggests that prior to the composition of the Śivadharma, in which 
Caṇḍeśvara begins to be transmuted not into the eater of nirmālya but rather into the punisher 
829Acharya, “The Role of Caṇḍa in the Early History of the Pāśupata Cult,” 216. 
858 
of transgressions of the samaya of Śaivas, “Caṇḍeśa is in fact Śiva, or, as some Śaiva Siddhānta 
texts have it, the wrathful form of the lord.”830 In both the image at the British Museum and 
the one on the side of the main temple of Bādami Caḷukyas831 at Pattadakal, Caṇḍeśvara is in 
fact standing on a large preta. Though the arms of the another image at Mahakuta, another 
early Bādāmi Caḷukya site, have been broken in a manner that limits our analysis of 
iconography, in the image from the British Museum, Bisschop identifies the remains of what 
he suggests is either an axe (paraśu) or chisel (ṭaṅka), the latter being serviceable as a weapon 
but primarily serving as the main implement used by śilpins working with stone.832 Rather 
compellingly, Diwakar Acharya has identified images of Caṇḍeśa identified preserved in the 
Paśupatinātha complex in Nepal—some of which can sadly be neither photographed nor 
viewed directly by Westerners—in which Caṇḍeśvara’s ṭaṅka is unambiguously represented 
as an artisan’s chisel. In the case of the most important of these images, the Chatracaṇḍeśvara, 
though the extant image is a later replica, the back of the column preserves a seventh-century 
inscription in which Pāśupata teachers praise Caṇḍeśvara as “the supreme deity of the universe 
(jagad idaṃ akhilaṃ yo ’sṛjat).”833 While remaining somewhat skeptical of Acharya’s 
interpretation of the Nepalese Chatracaṇḍeśvara in particular as providing the canonical model 
for later representations of the god, Goodall himself directs us to a number of additional 
830Bisschop, “Once Again of the Identity of Caṇḍeśvara,” 247. 831That two of these images are found at early Caḷukya sites is particularly intriguing, as a large corpus of inscriptions from this period are found in and around both sites, many of them speaking to the forging of a new special connection between the Caḷukya kings and the śilpins that resulted in a sudden proliferation of a new and grander kind of material culture, namely, the production of numerous free standing stone temples at the same site. 832As Dominic Goodall points out, our two earliest allusions to Caṇḍeśa are the Nepalese Skānda Purāṇa and the Mūlasūtra of the Niśvāsa. While in the first, Caṇḍeśvara is depicted as the virile hero who is lord of the Pramathagaṇas (Pramathendravīraḥ), and bears an axe (kuṭhāra), the latter, possibly dating to around the fifth century, identifies Caṇḍīśa as bearing a chisel (ṭaṅkadhāriṇaṃ), a detail that is even preserved in the Śaiva Siddhānta Kiraṇāgama. That this deity when more fully described has his sacred thread replaced by a snake points, as will be suggested, to his origins in the strata of the Atimārga that will become the Bhairava Siddhānta. 833Goodall, “Who is Caṇḍeśa,” 378. 
859 
examples in Śaiva literature of Caṇḍeśa being addressed as the supreme deity. In particular, 
Goodall’s translation of the pertinent passages in the Kriyā section of the 
Mataṅgapārameśvara as well as his insightful analysis, is worth quoting in full: 
“Mataṅga spoke: 
At the end of the worship of Śakti, is there or is there not another worship? What were the mantras of Caṇḍīśa raised for, o Lord? 
The Lord spoke: 
Not only have the mantras of Caṇḍīśa been raised earlier, o sage, but his maṇḍala, which has the form of a full (!) moon, has also been described. After inserting Caṇḍīśa who holds the axe [chisel], into that [maṇḍala], together with his body-part-mantras, one should invariably worship him at the end of the [other] worship using all white offerings. He should be adorned as far as one is able, in accordance with his power. The supreme Lord Caṇḍīśa, when pleased, and when attracted by this [following] hymn in such a way as to become physically present, grants all results that may be in his heart to the sādhaka of infinite radiance who is full of devotion: “Veneration to you, Lord of past and future! Veneration to you who are Śiva’s embodiment, to you whose form is great and fierce, to you who are Lord of the Universe, Supreme, Rudra, to you whose strength is unmeasurable, to you who are the son of Pārvatī, to you who contain power, to you who are fierce (caṇḍāya), griefless, great, to you who hold an axe [ṭaṅka] in your hand, to you who hold a staff, to you who have beautifully braided hair (sukapardine)! Veneration to you have are [sic] the universe! Veneration to you who are have [sic] a body of fire! Veneration to you Śarvaśarva, who are the cause of the universe!” Having praised the boon-giving, fierce-formed Lord Caṇḍīśa in this way, after a prostration with eight parts [of the body touching the ground], one should satiate [him by making offerings] in the fire and cause him to forgive [shortcomings].” 
The above passage is somewhat anomalous in several respects—the stipulation of a round maṇḍala (rather than a crescent one), the emphasis on white offerings (cf. Mataṅga kriyāpāda 1:57–8), the absence of any mention of nirmālya, his bearing both axe and staff (52cd), his being Śiva in form (50d), creator of the universe (53cd) and yet at the same time son of Pārvatī (51d), his being mentioned explicitly only at the end of the initiation involving the yāga of Śakti (which refers in fact to the worship of the VYOMAVYĀPIMANTRA in the navanābhamaṇḍala) and not at the end of the other varieties of initiation—but I have cited it here not for its anomalies concerning ritual context, iconography and mythology, but rather for the implications that it contains that Caṇḍeśa is Śiva, even if the implications are at once contradicted.834 
834Goodall, “Who is Caṇḍeśa,” 382. 
860 
Though he makes no mention of this fact, the nature of the sources upon which Goodall 
is drawing, namely, the Mataṅgapārameśvara, a decontextualized fragment from our own 
Piṅgalāmata, a passage from the Mayasaṃgraha, and the Pauṣkarapārameśvara rather 
tellingly replicate the same discursive pattern we reconstructed at the beginning of this chapter, 
wherein the texts in question originated as part of a shared Kāruka canon with an interrelated 
worldview. 
In this range of early textual sources where Caṇḍeśa is positioned, even if only 
temporarily, as the supreme deity, his veneration tends to travel in tandem with the 
vyomavyāpin mantra, a relationship between the supreme god and the goddess Vāgeśī or 
Vāgeśvarī, as well as a thematic concern with the eradicating or transcending of ritual impurity. 
It is thus scarcely a coincidence that in all but the oldest of sources, Caṇḍeśvara bears the chisel 
(ṭaṅka) of a stone mason or śilpin. In fact, it seems quite plausible that this iconographic feature 
directly reflects his adoption, or his point of origin, at some point in remote antiquity, as the 
central deity of the artisans—the Kārukas, who, at least by the time we encounter them in the 
textual record, act under the direction of their Lākula masters. In the medieval Deccan, this 
social and conceptual formulation would be translated into the relation between the 
pañcavarṇika householder sādhaka and his Pañcācārya Kālamukha guru. It is for this reason, 
as we have seen time and again—most extensively in the Piṅgalāmata itself—that in texts 
which bear traces of the Prāmaṇa śāstras, such agents are instructed to infuse the otherwise 
inert images of an emerging temple culture with vitality through the installation of Caṇḍeśvara 
861 
and his śakti’s powers into the liṅga or image, a task enacted through the use of the 
caṇḍabrahmamantras as well as the vyomavyāpin.835 
Indeed, apart from the specifics of the practice of the śilpin, many of the elements we 
have just discussed are already present in what is the perhaps the earliest extended discussion 
of Caṇḍeśa as a deity. Rather surprisingly, the passages in question are found in the earliest 
surviving work ascribed to the Śaiva Siddhānta, where they integrated into the fifth-century 
Niśvāsamūlasūtra’s account of the procedure that grants liberation. Some of the direct context 
for these passages836 we have already seen before while recovering and then historicizing the 
discursive space once occupied by the Lākulas and Kārukas in the first division of the present 
chapter. There we explored, briefly, how the initiate uses the five brahmamantras and the ritual 
deployment of the triad of śaktis (5.3–4) to yoke himself to different planar realities and ascend 
upward within the impure realms. Through the use of the hūṃkāra conjoined with phaṭ, 
passing through the cosmic egg of Brahmā, in Purāṇic cosmology, the outermost boundary of 
existence, the adept travels into the realms aligned with the Kārukas, here called the ṛṣikulas 
(5.8–5.13).837 Finally, aligned with the ṛṣikula, which is conjoined with the madamoha,838 he 
reaches the boundary between the pure and impure worlds. At this point, reborn in the womb 
835The later works of the Śaiva Siddhānta refer to this eight-one-part stream of syllables as “the womb of mantras,” and it is used extensively in consecration rites, especially for the installation of the āsana or pīṭha upon which the deity is seated. 836For the critical edition and translation, see Dominic Goodall, et. al., ed. and trans. The Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā the Earliest Surviving Śaiva Tantra: Volume I: A Critical Edition & Annotated Translation of the Mūlasūtra, Uttarasūtra, and Nayasūtra (Pondicherry: Institut français de Pondichéry/École française d’Extrême-Orient, 2015). The relevant portions are found in the critical edition of Niśvāśamūlasūtra (5.1–7.12, pg. 145–152). The corresponding translation is found on pg. 288–325. Translations provided below are adapted from the published translation of Goodall and his colleagues. 8375.11 mentions in passing the five śiṣyas and pañcācāryas, who here stand before the great knot (mahāgranthi). 838Compare with the opening of the Piṅgalāmata, “The great yoga (mahāyoga) [the yāmala of Śiva and Śakti] is encircled by the great mothers. It is established on the periphery of the womb of Mahāmāya.” 
862 
of the goddess Vāgeśvarī, he is emitted in the form of the praṇava mantra into the realm of 
the eight Pramāṇas of the Lākulas.839 
When he rises the next day, having been granted the capacity to achieve liberation, the 
adept, under the guidance of his guru, directs his worship directly to Caṇḍīśa, who again is 
venerated using the full set of five mantras usually reserved for a supreme deity.840 In this 
context, the best of maṇḍalas (maṇḍalottama) is created for the god and then eight-hundred 
homa oblations are offered into the fire. The ācārya then addresses the deity, “Please forgive, 
O lord (vibho), (5.24),” and it is proclaimed that the sādhaka will never be “smeared” by the 
eight flaws pertaining to the samaya (5.24). At the ritual’s end, we learn that the homa that has 
been performed is for the purpose of purifying the adept’s existing flaws (doṣaviśuddhārthaṃ) 
and more importantly, a disspensationalist logic is invoked suggesting that “he who worships 
Caṇḍīśa will be forgiven preemptively (pūrvaṃ) [for what would otherwise be transgressions]” 
(5.25).” With the words “once [the body] is burnt by initiation, they [doṣas or pāśas] do not 
rise again; once the body has fallen away, he [the adept] goes to Śiva” (5.26), the chapter then 
abruptly concludes. 
839At this point, the Niśvāsa tradition, drawing on a range of likely conflicting older sources it only partially understands, seems to have become confused, a dynamic that transfers into later commentators like Kṣemarāja. As a result, the cosmology now partially repeats itself, so the adept has to enter again into the womb of additional Vāgeśvarīs, be born again, and then travel through higher emanations of planes linked with different registers of the Atimārga, before finally coming to rest first in the sakala Śiva and then niṣkala Śiva realms. Thus, for example, as Goodall observes, the later Niśvāsa corpus and the Svacchanda miscontrues two additional ontic levels, called sādhyoṅkāra, what was “originally intended [was] to reflect the idea of the soul passing beyond the last level of the Lākula’s impure universe, namely, Ṛṣikula and being reborn from Vāgeśvarī into the pure universe as Praṇava, in other words, being produced (sādhya) from Oṃkāra” (Goodall, et. al., The Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā, 302). After this point we encounter the eight Pramāṇas yet again as well as another set of duplicated goddesses, followed by a replication of the sets of deities associated with the Atimārga. It is at this point, as the adept in the form of oṃ, entering into the highest part of the pure realm, that it seems he first encounters Caṇḍeśvara/Caṇḍīśa. 840 The Niśvāsamūla discusses Caṇḍīśa in vs. 5.22–26, 6.22–7.6, and 7.26. Goodall translates the passage as follows: “In the morning he should make offerings to Lord Caṇḍīśa, the bearer of the axe together with his five auxillary mantras, after first preparing for him an excellent Maṇḍala” (Goodall, et. al., The Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā, 309). The edition, however, describes Caṇḍīśa simply as ṭaṅkadhārin, a term that is just as likely to mean “the bearer of the chisel.” 
863 
Chapter 6 of the Niśvāsa Mūlasūtra, which immediately follows this section, 
introduces us for the first time to key components in the core pantheon and mantra system of 
the Śaiva Siddhānta. This has been taken by its editors and translators as indicative of treating 
the closing portion of chapter 5—despite the exclusive association our text has made between 
Caṇḍīśa and the rite for liberation, which eliminates all past and future sin—as largely legible 
in terms of a final expiatory offering to Caṇḍīśa as the guardian of the cult who enforces its 
norms. The text itself, however, nowhere makes such an understanding explicit and it is 
doubtful that one would have arrived at it free from the influence of later forms of Siddhānta. 
In fact, even in chapter 6, Caṇḍanātha continues to be consistently identified quite simply as 
the Lord (caṇḍanātha devadevasya kīrtitam, 6.23). Furthermore, the deity who is paired with 
Vāgeśvarī rather strangely is juxtaposed not with his usual functions in later Śaiva Siddhānta 
discourse—such as receiving nirmālya—but rather with the office of supreme ruler of the 
universe.841 In fact, the idiom in which he is characterized represents a kind of non-Mīmāṃsā 
inflected Vedānta, for the Niśvāsa imagines the deity as “the supreme reality, the unutterable 
supreme Śiva, the supreme Brahman, the supreme imperishable.” And very much unlike in 
Siddhānta sources, we are told that “the one who knows [this principle],” which is the true 
nature of the Lord, “is not stained by stealing gold or other things, by eating the flesh of the 
cow or by slaying a thousand brahmans,”842 and the text goes on to celebrate (7.11–14) the 
841 Further evidence for this dynamic, which would read the Śaiva Siddhānta as appropriating an older Atimārgic tradition in many ways more closely aligned with later Bhairavasiddhānta and Śākta traditions, is evident in our text’s mantra systems themselves as well as their mode of encoding. Explicitly the text invokes what it calls the kalāḍhya, to be uttered by the cumbaka, a set of mantras that will later be ascribed to the Kāmika by Abhinavagupta and to the Vātula by the Kālamukhas of the Deccan. Intriguingly, the invocation of this mantra, as well as the one that follows, seems to correspond to the point in the ascent through the planar realms where the adept’s soul, having been entered into the stainless realm (nirañjana), is enlivened by the Śākta saṃskāra (śaktisaṃskāramodite, 5.19). Our text is more invested in the mantra it called kaṇṭhyoṣṭha. This is in fact none other than a variant on the navātman mantra of the Bhairava traditions, H-S-R-Kṣ-M-L-V-Y-Uṃ, which continues to play a major role in the tradition of Śrīvidyā. 842Goodall, et. al., The Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā, 323. 
864 
supernatural powers, many of them rather aggressive and both inclusive of and extending 
beyond the classical eight siddhis, that the adept is sure to obtain. Once again, this sensibility 
at work is much closer to that of the Jayadarathayāmala than it is the sort of ethos we would 
expect in the Siddhānta. This is a value system entirely alignment with an older ontology that 
questions the very idea of ritual purity. 
In providing us with further examples where Caṇḍeśa is treated as a central deity 
Goodall concludes his analysis by turning to the Pauṣkarapārameśvara. In this fragmentary 
and unedited work, the second oldest Śaiva scripture after the Niśvāsa, in keeping with the 
discursive pattern with which we are now so familiar, as Goodall informs us, Caṇḍa is again 
assigned his own set of pañcabrahma mantras, here called the caṇḍabrahma mantras. Here 
also, much as we find in the Piṅgalāmata, the ritual ends with the installation of Caṇḍa’s 
version of the īśāna mantra into the head of the liṅga. The Pauṣkārapārameśvara has been 
neither published nor edited—and it is likely that once this task has been completed many 
further connections will emerge enriching our knowledge. In light of this rather limited 
reception history, it is astounding that the only other two passages in the text to which I have 
access are both pertinent to our analysis. The first of these, which seems to be evident from the 
beginning of the text, is the Pauṣkara’s use of the vyomavyāpin mantra, which it equates with 
the supreme deity as well as its invocation of the supreme reality as Dhruva, for as Alexis 
Sanderson has demonstrated, this is precisely the name of god that later Tantric doxographies 
assign to the supreme god of the Lākulas.843 The other is a passage preserved in the Śākta 
843Alexis Sanderson, “The Lākulas: New Evidence of a System Intermediate between Pāñcārthika Pāśupatism and Āgamic Śaivism,” The Indian Philosophical Annual 24 (2006): 143–217. The codex unicus of the Pauṣkarapārameśvara has been scanned and cataloged by Cambridge University on the website dedicated to its collection of Sanskrit manuscripts. https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-01049-00001/1. The most pertinent element of the sample transcription, covering a portion of the first folio, reads as follows: oṅkāranamaste stu vigatotma / namo stu te vividhotma namas tubhyaṃ vyomanāmne namo stu te / vyomavyāpi / namaste stu vyomarūpa namo stu te / sarvvavyāpi namas tubhyaṃ śivāna[sta] [1v4] [-4-]anāthaya namas tubhyaṃ namaś 
865 
paddhati of the Kashmiri Takṣakavarta, the Nityādisaṅgraha, the very same source that 
transmits the Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā discovered by Alexis Sanderson. In Alexis Sanderson’s 
translation, presented in passing in his incomparable the Śaiva Age, this reads as follows: 
‘There is only one caste, that of human beings’.‘No caste has been enjoined with respect to them, nor colour such as white. All are born from sexual union and the souls [of all] are equal. With the eye of knowledge Śiva is seen pervading all of them. If [they declare that] caste is relevant then this is the prattling of men whose understanding is destroyed by ignorance, who are under the sway of false teachings.844 
Succinctly, preserved across the apparent taxonomic divide of Śaiva Siddhānta Āgama 
on the one hand and Bhairava Tantras descending from the Picumata on the other, we have 
here a corpus of texts that not only share the sort of cosmological features we explored in the 
beginning of this chapter, but which are also bound together by uncanny doctrinal 
commonalities. And it is surely no accident that virtually all of this canon—even the 
Jayadarathayāmala itself—explicitly and repeatedly grounds itself in the social vision of the 
Śivadharmaśāstra. Within such a framework, the Bhairava Siddhānta and Śāktas are elevated 
and it is the Brāhmaṇas themselves who are the real “impure” paśus. All of these details in 
turn align rather closely with the Lākula/Kālamukha cultural milieu that from around the ninth 
to middle of the thirteenth century dominated the entire Deccan. Often, but not always, this 
ethos was animated by either a passive or pointed setting aside of Brāhmaṇical normativity, 
which seems to have been viewed as part and parcel of a parallel world that was itself akin to 
saṃsāra.

866 
Such a dynamic is most vividly realized—perhaps unsurprisingly—in the Caryāpāda 
of the Mataṅgapārameśvara’s fifth chapter, which prefaces the Lākula’s Rudra vow with 
which the text all but concludes.845 It is here that this tradition—which as we have seen is 
deeply aligned with the cult of Caṇḍeśvara, who oversees one of its three forms of initiation 
with Vāgeśvarī superintending over one of the others—speaks of the bifurcation of reality not 
only in cosmic but in social terms. There, we learn that in this world, action is divided into the 
dark (asita), the light (sita), and the mixed (sitāsita), and that each modality pertains to a 
845The relevant passages run as follows. As we saw in our section on the Mataṅga in the first division of the chapter, the text oscillitates between a range of attitudes towards caste, plausibly introduced in the redaction process that made it into a Siddhānta text, while at the same time repeatedly returning to an invocation of the norms provided by Śivadharmaśāstra where Śaiva initiation makes a person into someone to whom varṇāśramadharma does not really apply.

867particular level of reality.846 Uncontroversially, the realm of darkness is defined by the actions 
of actors who steal and inflict harm (hiṃsācauryādikaṃ), and in between the polar extremes, 
we find none other than the ritual acts contained within the Veda (vedādyantargaṃ), which are 
said to be a mixture of the dark and the light (sitāsitam). It is in regard to what our text labels 
as the defining characteristics of the realm of the light that the work deviates most from our 
expectations, for when the Mataṅgapārameśvara reaches for what defines the realm of the 
light (sita)—emblematic of goodness—is none other than the making of wells and step wells, 
dance and the singing of songs (vāpīkūpataḍāgādyaṃ)—in other words, the very activities 
associated with the social niche occupied by śilpins and Kārukas. Such light action, in turn, is 
identified with the spiritual (sitaṃ ādhyātmikam). While actions of dark or mixed nature, 
carried out by agents called paśus, can at best connect one to the planar realms of the gods 
ruled by Indra, in contrast, “that which is the Supreme brahman” is achieved by one who bears 
the liṅga through the use of the brahmavidyās extracted from the Vedāntadarśana.847 Such 
people who bear the liṅga, we are told, master the three modes of knowing—the knowledge of 
Vedic sentences, proper reasoning (yukti), and statements empowered by the Lord’s 
command—each of which is animated by its own discrete logic. However, it is through the 
force of God’s command—the most powerful source of knowledge—the Mataṅga teaches, 
that not only a Śūdra but even a mleccha is brought to dwell in the pure realm and engage in

pure action. Tossed into the wombs of Vāgeśvarī, such as person is reborn. Reinscribed with 
Śaiva saṃskāras, he has come to bear the perfected body of Śiva. 
Given its many valorizations of the ethos of crafting and its associated pantheon, the 
Mataṅgapārameśvara’s specific invocation here of the Śūdra, and not the rhetorically more 
evocative outcaste, is likely no accident. This is indeed the usual social location to which 
orthoprax discourse would assign the śilpins and their gurus, which pointedly falls outside of 
the scope of possible access to Vaidika knowledge. In contrast, the Mataṅga—at least one 
layer of the text—seems to be not so subtly intent on reframing those who do the deeds of light 
as the proper custodians of Vedāntic knowledge, belonging to a hyper learned class that is also 
engaged in the execution of public works projects. And indeed, such a sensibility is entirely 
aligned not only with the general currents of the Lākula inscriptional corpus in the Deccan— 
which paint a consistent picture of the Kālamukhācārya as a polymath savant who has mastered 
all the known fields of Brāhmaṇical knowledge without ever alluding to these teacher’s caste 
and gotra identities, but also with the vernacular memory of such traditions. 
Indeed, in his masterful study of the thirteenth-century Ragaḷĕgaḷu of the Kannadiga 
śivabhakta poet Harihara, Gil Ben-Herut offers us a glimpse at a tale that right down to the 
name of its antagonist, Kallayya—a clear evocation of a Kālamukha name like Kaḷēśvara— 
and his profession—that of artisan goldsmith—offers a perfect narrativization of the 
conceptual and social dynamics we have just uncovered. Kallayya, we learn, was born in city 
where he never encountered non-Śaivas—in other words, in a śivapura—and hated being in 
their company, a state of affairs that continued until he decided that it was up to him to go 
challenge rival communities on their own terms. Eventually, however, as Ben Herut’s 
summarizes: 
869 
Kallayya, a non-Brahmin artisan, masters Brahmanical scripture and wins theological debates, not only against the paradigmatic, traditional, non-Brahmin “others”—atheists (Lōkāyatas), Buddhists (Bauddhas), and materialists (Cārvākas)—but also against Brahmins. In this offhanded manner, Harihara redefines Brahminical knowledge: not only is its learning open to artisans, traditionally placed at the bottom of the Brahminical social scheme, but, in addition, the theological superiority provided by this kind of knowledge is used by the non-Brahmin Śaivas to outperform non-Śaiva Brahmins, right in their own scripture-based territory.848 
While in Ben Herut’s representation of Harihara’s story, much of this is ascribed to the 
poetic imagination of the author, or at least as some Kannadiga cultural innovation, the major 
episode which he provides us with, which ends the Ragaḷĕ—in which the artisan community 
challenge the ritual purity of Brāhmaṇas—is instead suggestive that what we are dealing with 
is a narrativization of a much older social normativity rooted in the logic of radical 
differentiation of domains, which as we have seen effectively ordered the medieval Deccan in 
general and the Kuntaladēśa in particular.849 Indeed when Harihara from thirteenth century 
Hampi tells the tales of the śivabhaktas of prior days, one of the figures in whom he is deeply 
invested, Kŏṇḍaguḷi Kēśirāja, is represented as the chief minister of a Kalyāṇa Cāḷukya king 
who seems to be identified with Vikrāmaditya.850 It is thus no accident that when the present 
work has identified additions to Goodall’s catalog of representations of places in Śaiva sources 
848Gil Ben-Herut, Śiva’s Saints: The Origins of Devotion in Kannada according to Harihara’s Ragaḷegaḷu (New York: Oxford University Press, 2018), 134. 849Having defeated all his rivals in debate, Kallayya has settled down to a householder’s life and now has a young daughter. One day, when she is returning from taking water from the temple well, a mad elephant obstructs her path, and she accidentally falls into physical contact with a Brāhmaṇa. Much to the Brāhmaṇa’s horror, the girl begins to scream that from the touch of a Brāhmaṇa she has become ritually polluted. Since the water which she has fetched for worship is now worthless, she pours it out on the ground and smashes the vessel in which it was contained. The baffled Brāhmaṇa proceeds to seek out Kallayya for an explanation, only to be told that even the dog of a śivabhakta will not touch such an impure person. When the Brāhmaṇa responds by mocking the impurity of dogs, Kallayya, offering perhaps for the first time of hagiographical trope that will come to be associated with Jñāndev, has them flawlessly recite the Yajurveda. After praising the dogs as king of Vedic recitation, the story ends with the message that “all Brāhmaṇas are equal to Śaivas dogs.” Here it should be noted that while some dimensions of this fourteenth century alignment fit almost perfectly with our earlier sources, its concern about avoiding impurity through other communities, though akin to some of the stricture in the Piṅgalāmata’s legal prescriptive portions, represents a major departure from the archaic Kāruka theological deconstruction of notions of purity as reflected in the chapter on pratiṣṭhā. 850Ben-Herut, Śiva’s Saints, 27.

where Caṇḍeśvara is represented as the supreme deity, apart from the Piṅgalāmata, the sources 
in question belong to the eleventh or twelfth centuries and are situated firmly within the 
Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya world. 
Our first example is found in Bilhaṇa’s Mahākāvya, the Vikramāṅkadevacarita and in 
fact concerns the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya king Āvahamalla himself, Vikramāditya VI’s father.851 As 
we discover in the fourth sarga of this poem, while his son Vikramāditya VI is off performing 
his digijaya by defeating the armies of enemy kings and raiding their treasuries, the Cāḷukya 
emperor suddenly falls ill. Declaring himself one whose task have been completed (kṛtakṛtya), 
the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukya decides to celebrate a samārohaṇa utsāva in the city of Śiva 
(girijānāthanagare). For the sake of benefiting others (upakārāya) in service to the lord 
Śrīkaṇṭha, the king declares he will abandon his body (kāya). He gives away his possessions 
(tyāgavrata) and then descends into the Tuṅgabhadrā river, an activity that apparently took 
place in the town of Kuruvatti. Entering the water up to his neck, before disappearing into the 
depths, the poem tells us that having bathed (snātvā), the king becomes one who is entirely 
intent on the pair of feet of the lord Caṇḍīśa (caṇḍīśacaraṇadvandvacintāparo ’bhavat).

Indeed, we actually have proof in the form of material culture that the worship of 
Caṇḍeśa/Caṇḍīśa among the Kalyāṇi Cāḷukyas bore a family resemblance to the sort of 
procedures outlined in the Piṅgalāmata. Much as our text prescribes the installation of “a black 
form, very radiant with four hands,” the Kalyāṇi capital city now called Narayanpur preserves 
a shrine in the vicinity of the main temple that would have been frequented by the Cāḷukya 
kings on a daily basis. Though the building itself is a modern reconstruction, it contains within 
it just such a visual representation. On the top of the image sits the pātra containing the 
goddess. Below it carved out of black stone and wearing a sacred thread made of a snake sits 
a peaceful one headed form of Caṇḍeśvara.

Narayanpur, Kalyana, Karnataka. Image of Caṇḍeśvara and the goddess as vessel. 
As for the second textual source, we find it in a by now rather familiar place, for in fact 
the veneration of Caṇḍeśvara as the supreme lord of the universe is the main focus of the initial 
Sanskrit maṅgala verses that prefaces the long inscription at Kukkunur that we explored in 
chapter 4. As you will remember, this is a text that praises the goddess, Jyēṣṭhā, who is secretly 
the Trika’s Siddhayogeśvarī. And yet, it is addressed to the Kālamukha pratiṣṭhāpanācārya 
Kaḷēśvara, an Atimārga Lākula who is nevertheless primarily making using of Śākta Tantras 
and venerating Mantramārga deities.852 In short, the inscription instantiates the fusion of old 
and new canons that we have been exploring throughout this chapter. The presence of this 
invocation at the outset of such an important document, dedicated to a Kālamukha guru who 
began his career overseeing the temple of the goldsmiths, provides us with virtually 
unambiguous evidence that figures like Kaḷēśvara and his disciples would have practiced as 
part of their highly hybridized devotional and ritual systems a cult of worship centered on the 
veneration of Caṇḍeśvara, incorporative of the sort of materials we have found in the 
Piṅgalāmata but also plausibly rooted in other lost Kāruka scriptures. It is thus highly likely 
that other figures within this same extended associational-patronage network—where sociality 
is defined by the special relationship of Kālamukha and śilpin—would have held similar 
Caṇḍeśvara related commitments. And while Kukkunur, for reasons we will explore in the

ninth chapter, is the place where such traditions have been jarringly interrupted, Shirshangi, 
which as we have seen was rhetorically and institutionally participating in a similar network, 
is still an active artisan center of worship. And at Shirshangi—as well as the sacred landscape 
in which it is now embedded—the multifaceted Śākta past of the Deccan’s artisans, including 
their clandestine association with a supreme god who bears an axe or chisel and repudiates 
social normativity, remains very much a living tradition. 
Though her public worship is now mediated through a layer of Śrīvidyā style upāsanā, 
at Shirshangi the goddess—abiding in her original mūrti—is openly revered as at once Kālikā 
and as Vāgeśvarī. 
Poster: Left to right, Sirshangi Kālikā, the goddess Gāyatrī, and the Viśvakarman sage Munīśvara. 
The local story runs that in the early modern period, this originally ferocious deity who fed 
upon human offerings was in fact tamed by a Viśvakarman siddha yogin sometimes called 
875 
Munīśvara, popular images of whom are scattered about the town and who is instantly 
recognizable on account of his iconic axe and unusual pot which is certainly not a water vessel. 
Popular image of Munīśvara showing Islamic and Śaiva features on album cover. 
As will soon become clear, Munīśvara represents a fusion of a likely quasi-historical 
early modern Viśvakarman siddha who plausibly also held Sufi commitments with traces of 
an archaic Caṇḍeśvara cult. Liturgically, however, it is transparent that in practice this 
Viśvakarman siddha, in his identity as Caṇḍeśvara, relates to the goddess as her consort, and 
that their relationship is suffused with ritual traces of the older Śākta sensibilities we have spent 
this chapter exploring. For in fact, as the pūjāri at Tintani worships the samādhi, the name and 
the mantras he intones belong to the worship of Caṇḍeśvara. 
876 
As Jan Brouwer, whose preliminary study of the site’s festival traditions is the only 
work carried out to date, has documented,853 at Shirshangi, the main festival associated with 
the goddess falls on the new moon in the month of Phalguna. During this day, a kalaśa is 
prepared, which after the processional is presented before the goddess. This vessel, presumably 
full of some unknown liquid, has been infused with the mantras of the axe/chisel bearing 
Viśvakarman siddha Munīśvara. As the sun rises, the pūjāri prepares nine balls of rice (piṇḍa), 
obvious ritual substitutes for clumps of meat. As we shall see, these correspond to nine ritual 
agents—called puruvants. In a prior ritual, this hereditary class of low caste adepts were 
dedicated to Caṇḍeśvara at his shrine at Tintani, where, as we will see, they perform a range 
of ritual functions during festivals. Around the new moon of Phalguna, however, the puruvants 
travel to Shirshangi from Caṇḍeśvara’s samādhi. Especially for the occasion, the puruvants 
collect nine swords, which are then presented to the goddess. While the adepts stand on the 
bali pīṭha, the nine piṇḍas are thrown into the air. As Brouwer tells us, as late as the 1980s, the 
Viśvakarmans still said, “It was believed that, formerly, the nine bachelors chopped off their 
own heads. One of them used to fall on the bhuta-pitha [bali pīṭha] here while the remaining 
eight heads rejoined their bodies after being sprinkled with sacred water [tīrtha].”854 For 
Brouwer’s informants, however such practices were a distant memory, for in the lived 
experience of the members of the community, what actually takes place is that “the nine. . . 
join the priest. . . in Kāli’s shrine for worship, which is followed by the cooking of the new 
rice and wheat. The day ends with mass feeding (prashta) of rice (anna) and sweetened wheat 
853The analysis that follows combines the evidence from the sections on Shirshangi and Tintani from Brouwer, Makers of the World, 411–442, with further details provided by Brouwer in conversation in his home in Mysore, in August 2017 and January 1, 2018. 854Brouwer, Makers of the World, 417. 
877[paishya].”855 On the fifth day of the festival, most likely echoing distantly the liturgy of the 
Picumata Brahmayāmala itself, on the floor inside of the goddess’s own shrine, nine more rice 
balls are placed in a circle corresponding to the eight directions—and the eight cremation 
grounds—with the one holding the deity itself being installed in the center. 
While further fieldwork at Shirshangi during the festival season would surely shed 
more light on the particular parallels as they persist in modern discourse, virtually all of the 
discursive production surrounding this tradition—most of which is focused not on the goddess 
herself but rather on the Viśvakarman siddha, gestures in similar directions. Though the 
intricate heavily entextualized narrative traditions connected with Munīśvara will have to await 
further study, for the moment, several episodes in the popular digests of his Purāṇa deserve to 
be highlighted, for these suggest places where the Viśvakarman siddha carries forward 
Caṇḍeśvara’s patrimony. Thus, when he visits Benares, supposedly his hometown, just like 
Caṇḍeśvara, Munīśvara consumes all of the food during a ritual offering. In this case, the king 
has just offered a community of Vaiṣṇava Brāhmaṇas food, but before they can begin eating, 
everything is consumed by Munīśvara. Munīśvara then proceeds to show his dominance by 
invoking the god Viṣṇu and directing him to clean up the dirty remnants of the Brāhmaṇa’s 
temple. Journeying to Kalyana, Munīśvara then teaches the Liṅgāyats how to control the 
ferocious Vīrabhadra, whom previously they could not control, in the process teaching them 
about the dharma of the Viśvakarmans. Finally, in the last stage of his life, after an aborted 
trial where his body begins to merge into a black rock, the very substance out of which 
Caṇḍeśvara images were made, Munīśvara arrives at the place where he will take samādhi, 
gives away his axe, designating that it is to be worshipped alongside the tools of the 
855Brouwer, Makers of the World, 417. 
878 
Viśvakarmans—especially the chisel—and then disappears into a cave where he is said to 
merge with the gods. 
As the extraordinary Mohit Kaycee has been documenting, under the more vernacular 
identity of Mōnappa,856 this same Viśvakarman siddha also participates in a shared religious 
ecology comprised of early-modern Deccani Dalit saints largely unknown to the Western 
academy. Each of these figures is practically defined by their antinomian consumption of meat, 
wine, and marijuana on the one hand and an ambiguous embrace of Sufi identity and idiom on 
the other. Mōnappa in particular, remembered as both poet and miracle worker, maintains an 
enormous following among what are essentially a range of low-caste Dalit Śākta communities 
found throughout the Deccan. As Kaycee has shown, prior to the “rediscovery” of what is now 
the core canon of Liṅgayāt vacanas, it was in fact the verses ascribed to Mōnappa and his 
disciples that represented the first exemplars of vacana to enter into print and circulate within 
the colonial sphere. Apart from their linguistic texture, which often experiments with a creole 
blending of Farsi and Kannada verbal forms, on a thematic level, Mōnappa’s vacanas offer a 
vituperative condemnation of religious hypocrisy as well as caste and purity norms, as when 
he declaims, “for those that fall from the cunt, where is their clan—the whole world is born 
from the womb, no one came out from the asshole.” Often rather unexpectedly, Mōnappa 
directs his ire not only at Brāhmaṇas, but to the Vīraśaiva followers aligned with Basava, as 
well as orthodox Muslims—the Sultan of Bijapur is said to have had the saint eviscerated and 
856My preliminary analysis of this material has been much enriched by dialoging with Mohit Kaycee, whose work the present paragraph summarizes and to whom it is much indebted. Kaycee, an independent scholar completing his PhD at Columbia University, has for the past five years been exhaustively documenting through videography a range of festivals in the Deccan where Dalit Śāktas and Sufis share ritual space, as well as translating the oral performances and written hagiographies associated with these traditions. 
879 
dismembered only to discover to his horror when he went to examine the body that Mōnappa 
was still sitting in the corner smoking his hookah. 
As we will soon see, the main festival celebrated yearly in his honor even offers an 
internal critique of the hierarchies operating among the pañcakāruka craftsmen communities 
themselves. As Kaycee shows, on a yearly basis during the first day of the five-day festival 
held at his samādhi at Tintani, thousands of devotees from all caste backgrounds—except 
Brāhmaṇas, who fast offsite—prepare themselves to be fed en masse in public, with the only 
stipulation being that everyone must commence eating at the same time so as to demonstrate 
that no one is being given any preferential treatment. Before they are allowed to touch their 
food, however, the custodians of the shrine must first seek out and feed a member of the Kuruba 
community, who otherwise plays no role at all in the festival nor is related to the cult. This 
decision, it is commonly recognized, is founded on Mōnappa’s own actions when the festival 
was inaugurated, for it seem that the siddha, who as a blacksmith by caste was subordinated to 
the higher ranking goldsmiths, was so appalled by the hierarchical caste prejudices of his 
followers among the Viśvakarmans that he pointedly went out of his way to offer the pride of 
place to strangers to whom he has no obligation at all rather than give license to the power 
games playing out within the pañcakāruka pecking order.857 
In fact, it is also within the context of this same five-day festival that the puruvants 
perform their main ritual duties, which again are vividly linked to the episteme of the Bhairava 
Siddhānta and its fellow travelers. Brouwer describes the puruvants, whose role entails falling 
into ecstatic trances during festivals, in the following manner: 
857Here we find a substantial discrepancy, for while Kaycee in his fieldwork has found Mōnappa to be exclusively understood as a blacksmith, in the text resources that have been explored thus far as well as in Brouwer’s study, he is typically represented as a goldsmith. It may be that these understandings both persist within specific caste communities, or that the story has changed in recent times as caste politics in Karnataka have become realigned. 
880 
The puruvanta is a man with long, often unkempt, hair hanging loose onto his shoulders. The only decoration on his face is a thick nama. . . of vermillion powder. . . applied with the thumb. He wears many rudrakshi (Guazuma tomentosa) necklaces and a colorful shirt. There is a copper buckle with the image Virabhadra on the front of his waist belt. His trousers are loose and colorful. In his right hand he holds a big sword. . . and in his left a bundle of long needles (trisula). Each time the procession halts, he dances and, at the climax of the dance, he pierces his underlip, tongue, cheeks, arms, fingers, stomach, etc. first with small and later in the night with big needles.858

As we can see, much about this comportment gestures towards that of the older 
sādhaka. Though further study—which is made quite feasible by the hundreds of hours of 
footage Kaycee has collected, including interviews with ritual actors onsite from across the 
caste spectrum—is needed to pin down the particulars during the festival at Tintani, it seems 
it is the puruvants who escort the processional image of Munīśvara. Perhaps most tellingly, on 
the last days of the festival, it is the puruvants who, while wielding their swords and dancing 
in circles, gesturing repeatedly to their left side, ritually “stab” themselves again and again as 
an offering to the goddess and her consort. Though nowadays the actual offering of one’s own 
blood seems to be confined to a controlled cutting of the tongue which is daubed onto cloth, 
like the nine sacrificial victims who ultimately are served at—and not for dinner—under the 
surface lurks a distant homage to the older tradition of Kāpālika argha.

Before the chapter draws to a close, it is fitting for us to return to the story with which 
this section began, what Brouwer calls the tale of the magnetic fort, which earlier we used to 
introduce the concept of the śivapura through recourse to persistent social imaginary. In 
labelling this chapter Art and Terror in Śiva’s City, part of what we have been preparing the 
reader for is the sad denouement of Brouwer’s story. In telling the tale of the magnetic fort 
where the Viśvakarmans lived in peace, performing their craft and governing themselves, the 
Viśvakarmans of the twentieth century transmit the memory of a tragedy. In most of the 
tellings, the Viśvakarman fort is brought down by an act of treason. The Brāhmaṇa Vyāsa, 
jealous of the wealth, learning, and independence of the artisans, convinced his daughter to 
seduce the guards to the city, and extract from him the secret strategies that would bring down 
the city’s defenses. Vyāsa’s daughter brings this information back to her daughter, the defenses 
883 
of the invincible city of Viśvakarmans are negated, and the “Brāhmaṇical world” emerges 
victorious. Expelled from their homes, the Viśvakarmans are forced to adopt the guises and 
livelihoods associated with various different castes—the distinction of right- and left-hand 
caste communities unknown to the medieval Deccan is born—and so, in many tellings, the 
story ends. Among certain communities in southern Karnataka, however, the story continues, 
reaching a very different sort of conclusion. As summarized by Brouwer from a written source, 
which was actually entered into the evidentiary record in the context of trial in 1818 where 
Viśvakarmans and Brāhmaṇas contested over justifying their respective rights and privileges, 
the end of this tale makes it a fitting coda to our own investigation and is thus worth quoting 
at some length. 
The Viśvakarman Vamsa-sthas, however, changed their natural form, began to follow the customs and manners of the different places in a different guise, just as the Pandavas had disguised themselves when they were in exile, suppressing their false dignity and their real self, adapting the language, customs, and practices of the fifty-six kingdoms and other islands, and have contributed towards the protection of the world. 
When the Visvabrahman Vamsa-sthas in the disguise of Desai-settis were selling their goods (made of the panchakrityas) to the kings of the fifty-six kingdoms, it was Vyasa who persuaded the Dharani Maharaj to levy a tax on the Visvabrahmans, and thus brought about dissension between them. They refused to pay the taxes to the kings of the fifty-six kingdoms. The king asked them why they were not paying. They replied that all the kings of the fifty-six kingdoms were carrying on their kingship, because the Visva-brahmans were fulfilling their duties through the panchakrityas. It was immoral to levy tax on them, as the kings were not ruling according to kalajnana or the knowledge of past, present, and future. It was against the Code of Manu to make them pay tax. 
Then Vyasa managed to win over the peasants to his side and declared that all those who supported the king were those of the Right Hand (balankey) and all the Visvakarmas those of the Left Hand (edankey). Thereafter, the Dharani Maharaj imprisoned the Visvabrahmans and confiscated their tools.859

884 
Our story has one last act—in fact this where most of the action takes places—but 
before we let that play out to its dramatic conclusion, it is worthwhile to pause and reflect how 
this story reads from the perspective of the peculiar intellectual commitments that animate the 
present work. If for the modern Viśvakarman, this is the tale about the origin of the right- and 
left-hand caste divisions, the core categories that now order caste relations throughout the 
Deccan, from our perspective the tale is a testament to a historical memory, confirmed by the 
historical record, that before the thirteenth or fourteenth century such division did not exist. 
Again, though it ascribes such prescriptions erroneously to the Laws of Manu where they are 
not to be found, Viśvakarman historical memory also recollects the logic of the non- 
Brāhmaṇa—indeed of the Kālamukha— akṣayavṛtti, where the state laid no claim to taxes and 
was divorced from the profits of craftsmen traditions. The imagined Vyāsa, perhaps a distant 
echo of another, very real historical Brāhmaṇa who commanded the ear of the king, intervenes 
and upsets a preexisting social contract understood as upholding dharma. When the artisans 
refuse to abandon strictures of the old order and resist the authority of the state, they are 
stripped of their profession and cast out from polite society. As we shall see in the final 
chapters, all of these details have their counterparts in actual historical circumstances. 
The final part of the story, in contrast, though indicative of the persistence of Kāpālika 
influenced elements at least on the margins of these communities well into the colonial period, 
seems mostly aspirational. 
When Desai Peddanna Arasu heard that Dharani Maharaja had imprisoned the Visvabrahmans and had confiscated their tools with which they performed the panchakrityas, he came along with his chariots, elephants, cavalry and infantry and confronted the army of Dharani Maharaj which immediately took to it heels and ran away into the forest. 
This enraged Dharani Maharaja who went to Tvashtrachari—who had been imprisoned by him—and told him that if he did not give his judgement he would behead 
885 
Tvashtrachari. The latter replied that if he was beheaded, Dharani Maharaja’s head would meet with the worst fate. The king severed the head of Tvashtrachari with the sword he held in his hand. That head prayed in surrender at the Kamakshamma. Kamakshamma took the form of Kali, got enraged and dug the intestines out of the king and garlanded Desai-setti with them who was devoted to her. Then she peeled off the skin of the king and gave it as a blanket to him and blessed the Visvabrahman Vamsa-sthas that their desires would be fulfilled if they prayed to her. Those intestines shine as a garland on the neck of the Desai-settis. The skin of the king became the blanket which was the skin of the enemy. Desai-settis always lift it up from the ground with the help of the toe of their left foot and not by the toe of their right foot or by their hands. This is known to one and all.860 
Setting aside the rather strange just-so story dimension of the above tale’s denouement, 
which bizarrely attempts to shoehorn a griping narrative bearing a myriad of implications into 
a straightforward explanation for why Desai Settis walk with a specific gait, the early modern 
legacy of the Viśvakarmans was to remain one of defiant resistance to assimilation to 
Brāhmaṇical norms that the artisans themselves were convinced had never previously 
governed their forebears in a manner that had concrete real-world implications well into the 
colonial period. 
Preserved in the archives of the British Library, which abound with the discourse of 
the successors our Śākta-Śaiva artisans, one finds a hand-written copy of a Marathi work 
entitled the Sacchāstramaṇḍana [sic], which forms but one part of a series of polemical 
exchanges going back into the nineteenth century between the śilpins and Brāhmaṇas. This 
work in particular is an exceptionally clever treatise composed by horrified Brāhmaṇas in the 
service of rebutting upstart artisan claims to twice-born status that contains a long appendix 
entitled “a condemnation of the Twice-bornness of the Goldsmiths 
(svarṇakāradvijatvakhaṇḍana).” While the voluminous Saccāstramaṇḍana for the most part 
offers a rich bricolage of Sanskrit and Marathi, the two brief passages with which we will

conclude are in fact in English (ingliśa-itihāsāṃta bahut pramāṇeṃ). Here, reproduced in situ 
in a fine colonial era Western hand, we are presented with extracts summarizing testimony 
offered in court (1821) by a Viśvakarman guru named Jugunnath Sunkurset, as well as the 
dismissive but rather telling comments of the British authority responsible for evaluating the 
case. In asserting the right of “the ruthakar Sonar caste. . . to the vedoktakaram,” Sunkurset 
proclaimed: 
The Sivagam states that from the five mouths of Siva produced five brahmans called Panchals, viz, Munoo, Maya, Twasta, Shilpee, and Dywadnya. According to the Rudraimul and Skand pooran, Bruhma was the father of petamaha Munoo who was the father of Prajapatee-the latter had eight sons known by the designation of wusoo—one of these named wishwakarma to whom were born five sons having the same names, occupations and rights as those mentioned above Viz, Munoo, Maya, Twasta, Shilpee and Dywadnya. 
Agreeably to the order of the Vishwakarma, Brahma assumed the form of Virat and from his mouth was produced Swayambhu Manoo, from which six brahmans and four oop brahmans had their origin. The eldest of the latter, Silpayan, had five sons, the first Manoo, the second Maya, the third Twasta, the fourth Shilpee, and the fifth Dywadnya These five learned the five veds from the five which were produced from Siv’s mouth and their names professions and rights and qualities were the same as those of their teachers. From the deity five were produced a man and a woman who were termed dywadnya goldmiths. The above four had a pure origin and were authorized to perform the Vedoktakarams and also the six rites called Shatkaram.861 
While what has been uncovered thus far of Jugunnath Sunkurset’s testimony—which 
apparently survives intact and in toto in the office of the Bombay Presidency—points to him 
asserting in court, on the basis of range of sources, a much attenuated claim that Viśvakarmans 
should merely be allotted the same rights as other twice-borns to perform “vedic ritual,” some 
comments from several years later by one of the colonial judges suggests that in practice, 
Sunkurset laid claim to a much more ambitious position for his community that effectively 
861Vitthala Sivaramasastri, ed., Sacchāstramaṇḍana athavā Svarṇakāradvijatvakhaṇḍana (Mumbai: Jagadisvara Chapakhana, 1876), 159–160. 
887represented a direct continuation of the Kālamukha-Kāruka compact that made the medieval 
Deccan. The Sonars or goldsmiths rank is next to the purbhoos in respect to caste. They however assert that they are superior to them, and some even go so far as to arrogate to themselves a position equal to the Brahmans. It is, however, notorious that they are a crafty and an unscrupulopus race, but persevering and patient. The Sonar is as indispensable in the village as the bhut [sic bhaṭṭa] and consequently, no large village is seen without its goldsmith who generally has the best house in the village. . . . 
It is said that the Sonars in Bombay under their distinguished leader Jugganath Sunkersett, have upset the old order of things, by declaring they are of a superior caste to the Brahmans and consequently pronounce it defilement to eat with a Brahman. They also have bhuts [sic bhaṭṭas] of their own caste to officiate ceremonies.862 
Through painstaking textual work with often incorrigible sources, in this chapter, we 
have begun to recover something of the institutional worlds and professionalization processes 
that shaped the Śākta-Śaiva artisans who built the medieval Deccan. As we have seen, this 
was a world governed by very different sorts of dichotomies than the ones our own disciplines 
assume and all but naturalize. What we would be inclined to think of as quite distinctive 
discourses, one domain focused on esoterica and ritual, to be pursued within the academic 
study of religion, and another set of “secular” technical disciplines whose proper venue would 
be some combination of art history, historical sociology, architecture, economics or the history 
of engineering, were instead perceived as forming an indivisible unity. They belonged to the 
realm of arcane knowledge mostly to be mastered by non-Brāhmaṇas. In much the same way, 
when we reassessed the scriptural resources seemingly eclectically drawn upon by our artisans 
and their Kālamukha teachers, the discrete categories we use to organize Tantric revelation 
seemingly on doctrinal grounds as forming schools of thought was revealed to obscure a more 
archaic form of cohesion that has as its focus common intended audiences largely defined in 
862Bombay govt. Records. N. VII New Series. As cited in Sacchāśtramaṇḍana. 
888 
sociological terms. With this in mind, it is worth revisiting one last time a slightly different— 
and likely more archaic— version of the five faces of Śiva that takes as its focus, not the five- 
fold revelation of different schools of thought, but the somewhat mysterious notion of the “five 
kalās,” which in mantra form are to be intoned as the adept is initiated into the systems. 
Īśāna Śāntyatīta (?) Aghora 
Sadyojāta Vidyā Nivṛtti (Funerary ?) 
Vāmadeva 
Tatpuruṣa 
Pratiṣṭhā Śānti 
Approached not as ontic modalities, but in sociological terms, it is probably no accident 
that three of these five categories can be readily associated with a “professional” identity of 
the sort that over time tends to mutate into a caste community. As we have seen, Aghora aligns 
with the class of professional teachers and administrators responsible for the mastery, 
preservation, and transfer of Tantric or Atimārgic knowledge, while Vāmadeva—our 
Kārukas—encompasses the skilled artisan communities that Brouwer calls “the makers of the 
world.” Tatpuruṣa correlates comfortably with professionals who specialize in what are 
889 
ultimately Atharvan derived pacification and royal consecration rites, a ritual technology that 
is also used in some forms of exorcism. Our doxographers have privileged Īśāna, effectively 
effacing traces of older traditions such that whatever might have come before is elusive. 
Slightly less problematically, the function allotted to Sadyojāta is a matter of informed 
speculation. Based on the use of the mantra in cremation ground contexts in sources like the 
Pāśupatasūtra and the transmissions later association with the “Bhūta” Tantras—which by the 
early seventh century from the perspective of a Dharmaśāstrin like Bhāruci are already 
associated with raising zombies and by the eighth century in our surviving fragments from the 
Bhūta corpus entails caring for the insane and terminally ill—this grouping may well have had 
something to do with working with the hopelessly sick or dying, caring for the dead, forms of 
necromancy, and the making of apotropaic objects like amulets. This is precisely the “pre- 
Tantric” social role still performed by specialized cremation ground dwelling monks in 
northern Thailand whose own practices seemingly derive from a Abhidhamma inflected pre- 
Tantric yoga akin to the discursive world of Atimārga meditation systems. 
Like all synthetic mappings, such a five-fold typology offers a mixture of prescription 
and description that simplifies on-the-ground realities. Nonetheless, even as a heuristic, this 
reorientation of perspective—privileging function and intended audience in place of doctrine 
and philosophy as ordering principles—brings us closer to the spirit of the style in which 
elements we might call doctrinal or philosophical are being presented in our sources. As we 
have seen in our encounters with the Piṅgalāmata, it is a mischaracterization of this discourse 
to say it is pre-conceptual, for in fact the text abounds with doctrinal tenets as well as imagery 
of the sort we associate readily with the sort of elite Tantric speculation epitomized by the 
Anuttara Trika of Abhinavagupta. What is markedly different is that in our scriptural sources, 
890 
philosophy does not take on a life of its own, but illustrates or informs the inculcation of 
concrete and particular social practices to be carried out by artisans and not by intellectuals. 
When the work of theology is not to make you a better and more brilliant debater and teacher, 
or a more powerful and effective overlord, but instead to help you make better buildings or dig 
deeper wells that will nourish more people, if you believe god can assume any form, it is better 
to envision your deity not as an exquisite living disquisition on the philosophy of language, or 
as the super king of kings enthroned within his all-pervading maṇḍala, but as the effective and 
intimidating master wielder of a chisel. 
To look at things another way, can we not see the production—almost exclusively 
conducted by Brāhmaṇas—of a second order learned intellectual discourse about the Tantras 
that does not jettison their key tenets, not as simple appropriation but in fact as another form 
of professionalization? Such a discourse, dare we call it “Tantrism”—brings the precepts of an 
initiatory system into proper alignment with the modes of social practice deemed socially 
appropriate for a certain class of people—namely, hyper-literate Brāhmaṇas—for whom the 
production of intricate and argumentative philosophical discourse and apologetics and the 
perpetuation of certain forms of pedagogy were in fact quotidian concrete and particular social 
practices? Such a framework does a better job of accounting for the fact that while 
theologically, works like the Piṅgalāmata and Tantrāloka share in common both core values 
and textual canons, in their form and their function there is precious little overlap between the 
two domains. Our mistake is then that we have misconstrued the relationship between the 
periphery of a discourse —the use of Bhairavasiddhānta, Trika, and Krama texts in the service 
of hyper-self-reflective gnostic exegesis presented for dialogical purposes in the Pramāṇa 
theory idiom of Yogācāra Buddhists—for its center. That we have erred in this way reflects 
891 
both our own professionalization and orientation—as academics we read books and teach 
students instead of measuring and then banging away at stone—as well as certain historical 
realities. To be blunt, the sort of community for whom the Tantrāloka was intended survived,

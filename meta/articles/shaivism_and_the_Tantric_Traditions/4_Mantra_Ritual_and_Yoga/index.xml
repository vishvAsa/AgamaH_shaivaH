      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jürgen Hanneder&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goddess Śārikā belongs to a group of Kashmirian lineage deities (kuladevī or vaṃśadevī) who, like Bālā, Rājñī, and Jvālā, are identified with particular locations.1 Śārikā resides on the Pradyumna peak in Śrīnagar, also known as the “Śārikā peak,” and is worshipped there in the form of a large stone around which a temple has been constructed.If one wishes to identify the cult practiced there and locate it within the religious landscape of the valley, a visitor might start with the modern inscription shown in figure 14.1, which reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Diwakar Acharya&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This essay concerns a pūjāstuti1 that guides its reciter through the mental or actual worship of the goddess Nityā. The text is composed in the first person but the author does not name himself in the text. The text is named Vāmakeśvarī stuti and attributed to Mahārājādhirāja Vidyādharacakravartin Vatsarāja in the colophon of the sole palm-leaf manuscript of the text available to me. How ever, the last verse of the text calls it Kāmeśvarīstuti and describes it using two adjectives, kāmasiddhi and atimaṅgalakāmadhenu. It is not unnatural, I think, to name this stuti using its first adjective.2&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Lotus Garland (padmamālā) and Cord of Power (śaktitantu): The Brahmayāmala’s Integration of Inner and Outer Ritual&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shaman Hatley&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The significance of the Brahmayāmala to the history of Śaivism was first iden tified by Alexis Sanderson (1988), who was gracious enough to read a section of this voluminous text with me at Oxford, in 2004, at an early stage of my doctoral research. This was a formative professional experience, and I remain touched by his generous hospitality towards me as an unknown visiting student. In the present essay, I revisit a particular thread which emerged from these reading sessions: the śaktitantu or śaktisūtra, the “thread” (tantu) or “cord” (sūtra) of divine power (śakti). This is a technical term of ritual distinctive to the Bra hmayāmala to which Professor Sanderson first drew my attention. Inquiry into the Cord of Power leads me to examine the ways in which the Brahmayāmala (hereafter BraYā) integrates meditational discipline with the somatic perfor mance of ritual, and to query its understanding of the category yoga.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;James Mallinson&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like many of the contributors to this volume, I had the great fortune to have Professor Sanderson as the supervisor of my doctoral thesis,whichwas a critical edition of an early text on haṭhayoga called the Khecarīvidyā. At the outset of my work on the text, and for several subsequent years, I expected that Sander son’s encyclopedic knowledge of the Śaiva corpus would enable us to find within it forerunners of khecarīmudrā, the haṭhayogic practice central to the Khecarīvidyā. However, notwithstanding a handful of instances of teachings on similar techniques, the fully-fledged practice does not appear to be taught in earlier Śaiva works. In subsequent years, as I read more broadly in the corpus of early texts on haṭhayoga (which, in comparison to the vast Śaiva corpus, is relatively small and thus may easily be read by one individual), I came to the realisation that almost all of the practices which distinguish haṭhayoga from other methods of yoga were unique to it at the time of their codification and are not to be found in the corpus of earlier Śaiva texts, despite repeated asser tions in secondary literature that haṭhayoga was a development from Śaivism (or “tantra” more broadly conceived).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>18 A Sexual Ritual with Māyā in</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matsyendrasaṃhitā 40&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Csaba Kiss&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this short article I revisit the Matsyendrasaṃhitā (hereafter MaSaṃ), a Kubjikā-Tripurā oriented tantric yoga text of the Ṣaḍanvayaśāmbhava tradition, probably from thirteenth-century South India, core chapters of which I edited and translated for my PhD studies under the supervision of Professor Alexis Sanderson. My purpose there was to demonstrate that this text provides evi dence for a transitional phase in the history of Śaiva Tantra, revealing aspects of a transition from Kaula practices to early Haṭhayoga. In the present essay I analyse, and partly edit, MaSaṃ chapter 40, in which a unique and somewhat ambiguous variant of a Śrīvidyā-type sexual ritual is described, and which Pro fessor Sanderson was kind enough to read with me in Oxford in 2005. I would like to dedicate this paper to him, offering new interpretations of some key ele ments, and thus updating my previous analysis (Kiss 2009, 66).1&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>19 Haṭhayoga’s Floruit on the Eve of Colonialism Jason Birch</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My doctoral thesis (Birch 2013), which was supervised by Alexis Sanderson at the University of Oxford, contained a survey of texts on Haṭha- and Rājayoga. One of the challenges of completing such a survey was that very few of the texts composed from the sixteenth to eighteenth century had been critically edited or studied academically. Inspired by several exemplary surveys of Śaiva litera ture in Sanderson’s articles (e.g. 2001, 2007 and 2014),I visited a large number of libraries in India in an effort to consult manuscripts of unpublished yoga texts. By the end of my doctorate, it was apparent to me that yoga texts composed on the eve of colonialism provided new insights into the history of yoga and, more specifically, are crucial for understanding how Haṭhayoga changed after it had been codified by Svātmārāma in the Haṭhapradīpikā (circa mid-fifteenth cen tury). In fact, after Svātmārāma had successfully transformed Haṭhayoga from an auxiliary practice into a complete soteriological system, there began what might be considered the floruit of Haṭhayoga, insofar as its literature flour ished, its systems of practice accumulated more techniques and it became, particularly in scholarly compendiums on yoga, almost synonymous with the auxiliaries of āsana and prāṇāyāma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

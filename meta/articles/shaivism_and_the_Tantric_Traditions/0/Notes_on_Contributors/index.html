<p>Peter Bisschop</p>
<p>is Professor of Sanskrit and Ancient Cultures of South Asia at Leiden Univer sity. In 2004, after finishing his PhD at the University of Groningen under Hans Bakker, co-supervised by Harunaga Isaacson, he was offered the opportunity of spending a year in Oxford as a Junior Research Fellow at Wolfson College. During his spell at Oxford, he met on a weekly basis with Alexis Sanderson in All Souls College to discuss his ongoing work on the Pāśupata tradition. In par ticular he was able to read with him a draft of his critical edition of chapter 1 of Kauṇḍinya’s Pañcārthabhāṣya, including a previously lost passage of Kauṇḍi nya’s commentary on Pāśupatasūtra 1.37–39 on the basis of a newly identified manuscript from Benares. An edition and translation of this passage was pub lished the year after in the Journal of Indian Philosophy, 33. In 2005 he was appointed Lecturer in Sanskrit Studies at the University of Edinburgh, where he remained until his move to Leiden in 2010 to take up the chair of Sanskrit. He has published extensively on different aspects of early Śaivism, in particular the Pāśupatas and associated lay traditions, from his monograph Early Śaivism and the Skandapurāṇa: Sects and Centres(2004) to his contributions to the ongoing critical edition of the Skandapurāṇa, as well as a new book entitled Univer sal Śaivism: The Appeasement of All Gods and Powers in the Śāntyadhyāya of the Śivadharmaśāstra (Brill, 2018). He is also the editor-in-chief, with Jonathan Silk, of the Indo-Iranian Journal, and general editor of the Gonda Indological Stud ies.</p>
<p>Parul Dave-Mukherji</p>
<p>is professor of Visual Studies and Art History at the School of Arts and Aes thetics, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India. She holds a DPhil from Oxford University,where sheworkedwith Alexis Sanderson on a critical edition of the Citrasūtra of the Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa from 1988–1991. Introduced to the rigour and intricacy of critically editing a text based on manuscripts, her work vindicated Sanderson’s view that the earlier work by Priyabala Shah was far from being a critical edition. In 2001, her critical edition, The Citrasūtra of the Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa, was published by the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts and Motilal Banarsidass, New Delhi. The śilpaśāstras and pre-modern Indian aesthetics remain important areas of research, along with modern/contemporary Indian/Asian Art. Dave-Mukherji has held fellowships at the Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, USA; South Asia Institute, Heidelberg, Germany; British Academy fellowship, Goldsmiths’ College, London; and Kun sthistorisches Institut, Florence. Her recent publications include “Whither Art History in a Globalizing World” (The Art Bulletin 96.2, 2014); Arts and Aesthetics in a Globalizing World, co-edited with Ramindar Kaur (Bloomsbury, 2014); and</p>

<p>projects: writing entries for the Tāntrikābhidhānakośa, contributing to the edi tion of Vallabhadeva’s Raghupañcikā led by Dominic Goodall and Harunaga Isaacson, and contributing to research on jātis, as well as to digitization of Gupta-era inscriptions within the ERC Project “Beyond Boundaries.”</p>
<p>James Mallinson</p>
<p>met Alexis Sanderson at an open day for prospective undergraduates at the Oriental Institute in Oxford in 1987. As a result of this meeting he changed his choice of course to Sanskrit. As an undergraduate he had Professor Sanderson as his essay tutor. Mallinson was not always the most diligent of students, so was delighted when Professor Sanderson agreed to supervise his doctoral stud ies at Oxford, which he started in 1995. His doctoral thesis was a critical edition and annotated translation of the Khecarīvidyā, an early text on haṭhayoga. After receiving his doctorate, Mallinson worked as a principal translator for the Clay Sanskrit Library for six years. In 2013 he became Lecturer in Sanskrit and Clas sical Indian Studies at SOAS, University of London. Since his doctorate he had continued to work on unpublished materials on yoga, often reading his working editions with Professor Sanderson, and in 2015 Mallinson was awarded an ERC Consolidator Grant for a five-year project on the history of haṭhayoga. Among the members of the project team is Jason Birch, another former doctoral stu dent of Professor Sanderson, and the team have continued to work closely with him. Among Mallinson’s publications is Roots of Yoga (Penguin Classics, 2017), an anthology of translations of texts on yoga, including several by Professor Sanderson and his former students, together with a detailed analysis of the his tory of yoga and its practices.</p>
<p>Libbie Mills</p>
<p>teaches Sanskrit and Pali at the University of Toronto. She completed her doc torate under Alexis Sanderson’s supervision at Oxford University in 2011. Her principal research interest is in South Asian architectural theory and practice. Her work on the architectural instruction given in the early Śaiva installation manuals (pratiṣṭhātantras) of North India features the first exposition of these texts’ contents. By examining extant buildings in light of texts, her research introduces new tools for dating, which are valuable for these as well as other sources. Her textual study has since expanded to cover domestic and temple building practices up to the modern period, in both South Asia and its dias pora. She is currently engaged in two research projects: “The Nāgara Tradition of Temple Architecture: Continuity, Transformation, Renewal,” funded by the Leverhulme Trust, and “Tamil Temple Towns: Conservation and Contestation,” funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.</p>

<p>Nina Mirnig</p>
<p>undertook her studies at the Oriental Institute at Oxford University. She first met Alexis Sanderson during the second year of her undergraduate course when joining an MPhil reading class in 2002. His inspiring teaching and the insights he offered into the fascinating world of Śaiva Tantrism prompted her to do her BA special paper in this field. She continued her post-graduate studies under his supervision on the topic of the socio-religious history and develop ment of Śaiva tantric cremation rites (antyeṣṭi) and post-mortuary ancestor worship (śrāddha). Upon completing her DPhil in 2010, she continued to work on early Śaiva religious history in an NWO-funded project on the composition and spread of the Skandapurāṇa under the direction of Hans Bakker. After a Jan Gonda Fellowship at the International Institute for Asian Studies in Lei den and briefly joining an AHRC project on the manuscript collections at the University Library in Cambridge, under the direction of Vincenzo Vergiani, she moved to her current position at the Institute for the Cultural and Intellectual History of Asia at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In addition to the early Śaiva tantric traditions, her research now concerns early Śaiva lay traditions, a critical edition of Śivadharmaśāstra 1–5 and 9, and the cultural history of early medieval Nepal, with special focus on the Sanskrit Licchavi inscriptions.</p>

<p>Péter-Dániel Szántó</p>
<p>began his studies at ELTE Budapest, where he received diplomas in Tibetology in 2004 and in Indology in 2006. He first met Alexis Sanderson at his depart ment in 2002, where he held a week-long intensive reading of Abhinavagupta. These sessions were so inspirational that Szántó decided to apply to Oxford, where he was successful in joining in 2006 with the help of Csaba Dezső, thus becoming both the śiṣya and praśiṣya of Sanderson. His doctoral thesis, defended in 2012, was on the Catuṣpīṭha, an early Buddhist Yoginītantra. After being a Junior Research Fellow at Merton College, Oxford, and then having a ten-month stipend in Hamburg, Szántó returned to Oxford as a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at All Souls College, thus having the enormous pleasure and privilege of spending many splendid dinners with Sanderson. He is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Leiden University in the Open Philology project. Most of Szántó’s publications deal with the literature of esoteric or tantric Buddhism in India, but he has also authored papers on poetics, epigraphy, and material culture. His latest publication, “Mahāsukhavajra’s Padmāvatī Commentary on the Sixth Chapter of the Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇatantra: The Sexual Practices of a Tantric Buddhist Yogī and His Consort” ( Journal of Indian Philosophy 46), was co-authored with Samuel Grimes. Szántó is currently working on the editio princeps of the Sarvabuddhasamāyogaḍākinījālaśaṃvara, a project featuring much input and inspiration from the man we celebrate in this volume.</p>

<p>Judit Törzsök</p>
<p>completed an MA in Indic Studies at ELTE University, Budapest, and then con tinued her studies at the University of Oxford in 1993, where she was funded by the George Soros Foundation to do research on Abhinavagupta under Professor Sanderson’s supervision. In 1994, having received the Domus Senior Scholar ship at Merton College, she started working on the Siddhayogeśvarīmata for her DPhil, supervised by Sanderson. The years spent in Oxford under his guidance determined the course of her research, which has focused on the early history of yoginī cults ever since. After postdoctoral research fellowships at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and at the University of Groningen (supervised by Profes sor Hans Bakker), she was elected Associate Professor (maître de conférences) in 2001 at the University Charles-de-Gaulle Lille III in France, and professor (directeur d’études) at the École pratique des hautes études (EPHE) in 2018. She defended her Habilitation in 2011, at the École pratique des hautes études (Religious Studies Section), entitled The Yoginī Cult and Aspects of Śaivism in ClassicalIndia, supervised by Professor Lyne Bansat-Boudon. She regularly con tributes to the dictionary of Hindu tantric terminology (Tāntrikābhidhānakośa, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna) and participates in the Skandapurāṇa Project (Leiden-Kyoto). In addition to papers on various aspects of Śaivism and the early yoginī cult, she has also published on epigraphy, Tamil Śaiva devo tional poetry, and classical Sanskrit literature.</p>
<p>Anthony Tribe</p>
<p>is an independent scholar working in the field of Indian tantric Buddhism, and at present a senior fellow of the Center for Buddhist Studies at the University of Arizona, Tucson. He received his doctorate in Indian Buddhism from Oxford in 1995. Subsequently, he taught in the Asian Studies program at the Univer sity of Montana, Missoula, USA. In Oxford, his doctoral thesis on Vilāsavajra’s Nāmamantrārthāvalokinī was supervised by Professor Sanderson. He remem bers with deep gratitude and much warmth the personal tutoring, encour agement and friendship he received from him during that time. Many after noons and evenings were spent in Professor Sanderson’s study at his home in Eynsham: learning how to read manuscripts and produce critical editions; exploring Vilāsavajra’s tantric Buddhism; and being fed before catching a late bus back to Oxford. He remembers too the infectiousness of Professor Sander son’s enthusiasm and commitment, his humour, looking after his house and cat, the clatter of the keyboard on his early, tiny-screened but magical, Apple Macintosh computer, and the kindness of being given the use of it while he was on sabbatical for a term lecturing in Paris. Dr. Tribe is also a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, and his publications include Tantric Buddhist Practice in</p>

<p>India: Vilāsavajra’s commentary on the Mańjuśrī-nāmasaṃgīti. A critical edition and annotatedtranslation of Chapters 1–5 with introductions, and (as co-author) Buddhist Thought: a complete introduction to the Indian tradition, both pub lished by Routledge. At present he lives in Tucson, Arizona, with two cats and too many books. He tries to keep cool in the summer.</p>

The pashchimAMnAya texts like the root samvartA-maNDala-sUtra-s, manthAnabhairava-tantra, and saMvarta-prakAsha state that first lineage of teaching from shiva and shakti (the haMsa dyad of this meditation) was transmitted by the 18 nAtha-s known as the khechara-s. The teachings of these 18 is referred to as the "aShTAdasha-divyAmnAyAnukramam." 

This 18 fold transmission is seen as the original divine layer atop the embodied transmissions of human nAtha-s. The latter consists of one branch of 3 lineages known as the oli-s with a teacher each in oDDiyAna, kAmarUpa and pUrNagiri and another branch of 9 nAtha-s. 

The 18-fold transmissions are mentioned in a now lost text known as the bR^ihadAgama cited in a Nepalian TIka on the kubjikAmata. The number 18 of divisions of these teachings signifies what the pashchimAmnAya refers to as nava-nava-kalita: 

- the 9 coming from navAtman-bhairava or kubjIshAna and 
- the 9 coming from kubjikA of chi~nchiNI. 
  
The s.m.sutra-s state that the original tantra(s) of the kula-krama is this 18 fold teaching. In the beginning of the manthAna-bhairava-tantra, the bhairava asks the bhairavI to teach the 18 divisions:

> etat sarvaM samAsena  
pUjya-sadbhAva-nirNayam |  
tasya+aShTAdasha-bhedAni  
kathaM j~nAsyanti putrakAH ||

> All this in brief is the essence of the definition of worship.
How will the putraka-s (aspirants) know its 18-fold divisions?

These 18 tantra-s were expounded by the bhairavI as:

1\. unmana; 2. manonmana; 3. samanA; 4. vyApinyA; 5. avyakta; 6. nandinI; 7. manthAna; 8. (p)heruka; 9. samaya; 10. jambhala; 11. kAlasaMkarSha; 12 chaNDa; 13. aghorIsha; 14. trailokya; 15. vinaya; 16 kamala; 17. charchikA; 18 shrInAtha.

The teachers of these are given as:

1\. shabdarAshI; 2. samvarta; 3. khechara; 4. ananta; 5. amogha; 6. bindunAtha; 7. anAdi; 8. shukra; 9. ajAtAnanda; 10. rakta; 11. krIDAnAtha; 12. AshAnanda; 13. oghanAtha 14. rasAnanda; 15. dhvaja; 16. jvAlAdeva; 17. nagna; 18. kubjAnanda

> O, who is verily beyond the state of the raging mind stationed at the end of the Eighteen!  
You are shAmbhavI who awakens shambhu.  
O you who are the great [shakti-s] of will, action and knowledge, the straight line (the constituent of the triangle of the yantra signifying the 3 shakti-s), the snake-like one (kundalini shakti), the one known as vAmA; raudri of the universe, the auspicious jyeShThA; you are called ambikA; You stationed on beyond the series of states transcending the raging mind.  
You are of subtle form; you are of the form of the half-moon emitting good light; you are surrounded by triangles [and] stationed in the center; you emerge from the figure of the three lines; you are complete and reside in the central sacred seat.  
O kubjI, you are mAlinI who awakens the gander (hamsa). When you enter the [brahma] aperture (cranial fontanelle), you are sprinkled internally by the stream of nectar of the shiva principle.

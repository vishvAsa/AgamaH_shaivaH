kAmarUpa, while today primarily worshipped under a traipura (dakShiNAmnAya) or a kAlIkula (a stream of uttarAmnAya) yAga,  
appears to have originally been affiliated with the pashchimAmnAya.  
In the kAlikApurANa, the primary kAmarUpa oriented text,  
shiva teaches his sons, the vetAla and the bhairava (to be understood as baTuka) thus:

> gachChataM kAmarUpAntaH  
pIThaM nIlAchala+ahvayam ||  
kAmAkhyA-nilayaM guhyaM  
*kubjikApITha*-saMj~nakam |
AkAsha-ga~NgA yatrAsti  
taj-jalair abhiShichya cha ||
tatra+ArAdhayataM putrau  
mahAmAyAM jaganmayIm |  
sA prasannAchirAd devI  
varadA nau bhaviShyati ||

> Go to the station at kAmarUpa called the nIla hill,  
the secret residence of kAmAkhyA, known as the station of *kubjikA*;  
> where the heavenly ga~NgA is,  
> and after ablutions with her water,  
> there worship mahAmAyA, encompassing the worlds, o sons.  
> Pleased, the goddess will become boon-giving to us two in a short while.

The text seems to encode a layering in its mythology. 

1. The place was originally the kubjikA-pITha. 
2. The yoni-maNDala of sati fell at that pITha making it kAmAkhyA.+++(5)+++ 

The hill of shrine nIlakuTa: shiva is said to have become this blue hill to retain his contact with his consort.  
This name suggests a connection to the ancient atharvanic names of rudra like nIlarudra or nIlashikhaNDin, which indicate his blueness.   
Originally, rudra is said to have assumed the form of a large mountain  
further supported by mountainous forms of brahman and viShNu as varAha.  
But these mountainous forms of the gods sunk under the weight of the goddess' yonI  
leaving behind a mere hill.  
The residues of the viShNu mountain are said to have become the cluster of vaiShNava shrines in the vicinity.

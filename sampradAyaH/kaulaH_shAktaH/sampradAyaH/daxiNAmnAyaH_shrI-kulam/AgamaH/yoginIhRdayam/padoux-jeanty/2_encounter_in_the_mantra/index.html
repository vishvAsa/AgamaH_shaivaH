the purpose of this chapter is to teach how to understand the inner hidden meaning—and thus the mystical effi
cacy—of Mahātripurasundarī’s
mantra, the śrīvidyā. As was the case for the śrīcakra , this effi cacy results
from the agreed common presence ( saṁketa ) of Śiva and Śakti in Tripurā’s mantra, whose constituent phonemes will be shown to be pervaded by the interactive presence and power of these two, male and female, aspects of the supreme deity and therefore as imbued with saving power. Diff erent aspects assumed by the Goddess, along with cosmic elements, are also shown as expressed by the phonemes of the vidy ā.">

  <p>mantrasaṁketa</p>
<p>the purpose of this chapter is to teach how to understand the inner hidden meaning—and thus the mystical effi</p>
<p>cacy—of Mahātripurasundarī’s</p>
<p>mantra, the <em>śrīvidyā.</em> As was the case for the <em>śrīcakra</em> , this effi cacy results</p>
<p>from the agreed common presence ( <em>saṁketa</em> ) of Śiva and Śakti in Tripurā’s mantra, whose constituent phonemes will be shown to be pervaded by the interactive presence and power of these two, male and female, aspects of the supreme deity and therefore as imbued with saving power. Diff erent aspects assumed by the Goddess, along with cosmic elements, are also shown as expressed by the phonemes of the <em>vidy</em> <em>ā</em>.</p>
<p>The interpretations given in this chapter of the hidden meanings of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> are, however, often extremely far-fetched and sometimes very diffi cult to understand, even with the help of Amṛtānanda’s commentary. Even Professor Dvivedi, whose edition was used to translate the YH and the Dīpikā</p>
<p>and with whom I read and discussed this chapter, was in many cases unable to explain the meaning of some stanzas and the corresponding passages of the commentary. We therefore do not expect the reader to fi nd our attempt at deciphering such passages very satisfactory or always fully intelligible.</p>
<p>I will now tell you the divine presence of [Siva and the Goddess embodied] in the mantra. Whoever knows this becomes, like</p>
<p>Tripurā, master of the circle of heroes. //1//</p>

<p><em>Encounter in the</em> Mantra* *</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>The master of the heroes ( <em>vīra</em> ), that is, of those who have attained the highest knowledge and supernatural powers, is the supreme Śiva. The realization of the inner secret meaning of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> leads thus to identifi cation with the supreme godhead.</p>
<p>The <em>śrīvidyā</em> being the root mantra ( <em>mūlavidyā</em> ) of the Goddess is considered to be, like the deity, surrounded by secondary (or ancillary) feminine mantras—those of the Cakreśvarīs, the regent-goddesses of the nine parts of the <em>śrīcakra</em> , which the <em>sādhaka</em> is to assign by <em>nyāsa</em> on the nine centers of his yogic body, thus mentally identifying himself with these nine powers. These nine <em>vidyās</em> are the following:</p>
<p>The fi rst is the Karaśuddhikarī, the second one Ātmarakṣikā, the third Ātmāsanagatā; then, after her, //2// [comes] Cakrāsanagatā, then Sarvamantrāsanasthitā. Sādhyasiddhāsana is the sixth one,</p>
<p>her nature being that of Māyā and Lakṣmī, supreme. //3// The one called Mūrtividyā is the seventh goddess. The eighth one is the <em>vidyā</em> Āvāhinī; the ninth is the supreme Bhairavī, //4// also called Mūlavidyā, subjugating the three worlds.</p>
<p><em>karaśuddhikarītvādyā dvitīyā ātmarakṣikā</em> /</p>
<p><em>ātmāsanagatā devītṛtīyā tadanantaram</em> //2//</p>
<p><em>cakrāsanagatā paścāt sarvamantrāsanasthitā</em> /</p>
<p><em>sādhyasiddhāsanāṣaṣṭhīmāyālakṣmīmayīparā</em> //3//</p>
<p><em>mūrtividyā ca sā devīsaptamīparikīrtitā</em> /</p>
<p><em>aṣṭamy āvāhinīvidyā navamībhairavīparā</em> //4//</p>
<p><em>mūlavidyā tathā proktā trailokyavaśakāriṇī</em> /</p>
<p>These nine Vidyās preside over the nine parts of the <em>śrīcakra</em> , from the outer square to the central triangle with the <em>bindu</em> in its center. To each of them a particular role or function, expressed by her name, is ascribed. The fi rst is Karaśuddhikarī, “purifi er of the hands,” since the hands of the adept are to be purifi ed before he performs the ritual. He is also to protect himself against all mental or spiritual imperfections and especially against egoism and the illusion of duality, hence the name Ātmarakṣikā, “protector of the Self,” of the second Vidyā. The third one, “who stays on the throne of the Self,” embodies, according to Amṛtānanda, the consciousness of the unity of the <em>sādhaka</em> , the <em>cakra</em> , the mantra, and the Self. The fourth is Cakrāsanagatā,</p>
<p>“having the <em>cakra</em> as a seat,” while the fi fth, Sarvamantrāsanasthitā, “abiding</p>
<p>60
on the throne of all mantras,” presides over the portion of the <em>śrīcakra</em> called Sarvārthasādhaka, “which fulfi lls all wishes.” The sixth, Sādhyasiddhāsana,</p>
<p>“the seat of the accomplishment of what is to be accomplished,” governs the powers nearest to the Goddess, the accomplishment alluded to being the cosmic work of the Goddess as symbolized by the <em>śrīcakra</em> and the <em>śrīvidyā.</em></p>
<p>The seventh is the Mūrtividyā, the visible form of the Goddess. The eighth one, Āvāhinīvidyā, is the one used to invoke and keep (during worship) the presence of the Goddess. The ninth <em>vidyā</em> is Bhairavī, the Goddess herself; she is therefore the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , the <em>mūlamantra</em> of Mahātripurasundarī. 1</p>
<p>Thus, O Mistress of Kula, these nine kinds [of <em>vidyās</em> ] are to be carefully placed //5// at the time of worship, in order, by the <em>sādhaka</em> .</p>
<p><em>evaṁ navaprakārās tu pūjākāle prayatnata ḥ</em> //5//</p>
<p><em>etā ḥ krameṇa nyastavyā ḥ sādhakena kuleśvari</em> /</p>
<p>The term <em>kula</em> , or Kula, is often met with in the YH and the Dīpikā.</p>
<p>It refers in a general way to the ensemble of nondualist Śaiva traditions formed by four <em>āmnāyas</em> (see the introduction, above). But it also has technical meanings. It is used to designate not only the yogic imaginal body but also the physical body or the universe conceived as a body: the grouping of diverse elements. In its usual meaning, <em>kula</em> means family or clan, notably the clan of the Yoginīs. The Goddess as “Mistress of Kula” is thus the mistress of the universe in all its cosmic or bodily aspects.</p>

<p><em>akulādiṣu pūrvoktasthāneṣu paricintayet</em> /</p>
<p><em>cakreṣvarīsamāyuktaṁ navacakraṁ puroditam</em> //8//</p>
<p>The adept is to evoke meditatively each of the nine constitutive <em>cakras</em> of the <em>śrīcakra</em> in each of the nine <em>cakras</em> of his yogic body. He must thus meditate intensely ( <em>bhāvayet</em> ), fi rst, on the Trailokyamohanacakra, the square outer portion of the <em>śrīcakra</em> , presided over by Tripurā in the thousand-petal red <em>akulapadma</em> at the root of the <em>suṣumnā.</em> Then he meditates on the Sarvāśaparipurakacakra presided over by Tripureśī, in the <em>vahnyādhāra,</em> that is, the <em>mūlādhāra</em> , and so forth, up to the Sarvānandamayacakra, with Mahātripurasundarī, in the <em>bindu</em> , on the forehead.</p>
<p>In this way, the adept perceives mentally the nine parts of the <em>śrīcakra</em> and the nine deities abiding there up to the supreme Goddess as present in his body, tiered along his <em>suṣumnā</em> . This identifi es him with the deity both in her diagrammatic form and in her fullness as the nine aspects she assumes in the <em>śrīcakra.</em></p>
<p>Of these I shall tell the names in their proper order. The fi rst is the goddess Tripurā; the second is Tripureśvarī; //9// the third is the the goddess named Tripurasundarī; the fourth, a great goddess, is Tripuravāsinī. //10// The fi fth is Tripuraśrī, the sixth Tripuramālinī; the seventh is Tripurasiddhi, the eighth Tripurāmbikā. //11// As for the ninth, she is the great Goddess Mahātripurasundarī. These goddesses are to be worshipped in their proper order in the ninefold <em>cakra</em> previously described. //12//</p>

<p>The worship prescribed here is purely mental, each of the nine</p>
<p>Cakreśvarīs being mentally visualized and worshipped as abiding in each of the nine yogic bodily <em>cakras</em> , from the red thousand-petaled <em>akulapadma</em></p>
<p>62
to the <em>bindu</em> . This identifi es the adept with these nine forms of the supreme Goddess, who appears thus as ninefold though remaining the one and supreme power, bestowing youth and immortality through identifi cation with Śiva:</p>
<p>O Parvati! The primordial One [ <em>ādyā</em> ] appearing thus at the time of worship under nine [diff erent] aspects has in truth only one form, that of the primordial Power [ <em>ādyaśakti</em> ] bestowing eternal youth and immortality //13//</p>

<p><em>ekākārā hy ādyaśaktir ajarāmarakāriṇī</em> //13//</p>
<p>The Dī explains here that the only one who is eternally young and immortal is Śiva, and therefore, what the worshipper will now enjoy is the condition of Śiva. The reader will note that the above stanza shows that the aim of the rites described in the Tantra is the gaining of supernatural rewards or powers in addition to liberation.</p>
<p>The reason stanzas 1–13 of this chapter enumerate the deities of the <em>śrīcakra</em> and prescribe their <em>nyāsa</em> and worship in the <em>śrīcakra</em> is not clear, since the theme of this chapter is the expounding of the esoteric meanings of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> . We may imagine, however, that such a worship and the spiritual union with the deity are to precede and facilitate the mental exertion needed to understand the often abstruse reasoning and arcane speculations of stanzas 16–80 of this chapter, which are now expounded.</p>
<p>The practice of the mantra [ <em>mantrasaṁketaka</em> ] of that [primordial power] can take diff erent forms. It is only by following the tradition and the regular order of the various mantras that one can obtain [its knowledge]. //14//</p>

<p>We have already explained the meanings of the term <em>saṁketa</em> in the introduction and chapter 1.

<p>( <em>gurupāramparā</em> ) of the Śrīvidyā school; no outside or personal interpretation is valid. Six such esoteric interpretations are given here.</p>
<p>The “various mantras” alluded to above are not diff erent mantras but the various meanings given to the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , each considered a diff erent mantra since each discloses a diff erent understanding of it. The expression refers also to the three subdivisions, the <em>kūṭas</em> or <em>bījas</em> , of the <em>śrīvidyā</em></p>
<p>or to its constituting phonemes, all of which are mantras in their own right. The term may also refer to the nine Vidyās we have just seen, which are both deities and feminine mantras.</p>
<p>This [practice] is sixfold, O Mistress of the Gods! I will tell it to you, O Perfect One!</p>
<p>There is the natural meaning, the traditional one, the inner meaning, the <em>kaulika</em> meaning, //15// then the completely secret meaning, and fi nally the meaning according to the highest reality.</p>
<p><em>ṣ aḍvidhas taṁ tu deveśi kathayāmi tavānaghe</em> /</p>

<p><em>tathā sarvarahasyārtho mahātattvārtha eva ca</em> /</p>
<p>As we shall see, the six symbolic interpretations of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> give mainly the esoteric meanings to be extracted from it, but they also describe meditative and yoga practices to be followed so as to experiment in mind and body the purport and power of the mantra. The interpretations given by the YH are in some cases complex and far-fetched. The most obscure and diffi</p>
<p>cult to understand fully, even with the help of Amṛtānanda’s (or Bhāskararāya’s) commentary, are the “natural” ( <em>bhāvārtha</em> ) meaning ( <em>śl</em> .</p>
<p>16–25) and the “traditional” ( <em>saṁpradāya</em> ) meaning ( <em>śl</em> . 26–48a). The other ones are more briefl y expounded.</p>
<p>Although the explanations given are entirely based on the syllabic pattern of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , neither the YH nor Amṛtānanda’s Dīpikā gives its syllabic composition, its “extraction” ( <em>udhāra</em> ) 4 . It is clear, however, that for the YH, the <em>vidyā</em> is—as we noted in the introduction—in the so-called <em>hādi</em> form, namely its fi fteen syllables, shared out into three groups called <em>kūṭa</em> (or sometimes <em>bīja</em> ): *HA SA KA LA HRĪṂ • HA SA HA KA LA HRĪṂ *</p>
<p><em>• SA KA LA HRĪṂ .</em></p>
<p>The natural meaning is simply the meaning of the phonemes</p>
<p>[ <em>akṣara</em> ] [of the <em>vidyā</em> ], O Parameśvarī! //16//</p>
<p><em>akṣarārtho hi bhāvārtha ḥ kevala ḥ parameśvari</em> //16//</p>

The king of mantras, O dear One! is at all times engendered by the union of Śiva and Śakti and by that of the Yoginīs, the Vīras, and the Vīrendras. //17//</p>
<p>Thus constituted, delighting in the utmost bliss, the Goddess,</p>
<p>whose nature is vibration [ <em>spanda</em> ], of innate beauty, once known, is to be freely worshipped. //18//</p>

<p><em>nisargasundarīṁ devīṁ jñatvā svairam upāsate</em> //18//</p>
<p>As we will see in the following pages, the interpretation that the YH gives in stanzas 18–25 of the <em>bhāvārtha</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> is anything but a description of “simply the meaning of the syllables” ( <em>akṣarārtha</em> ) of the <em>vidyā</em> ; of all the six <em>arthas</em> , this is by far the most obscure and diffi cult to understand.</p>
<p>The above stanzas 17 and 18 describe the whole <em>śrīvidyā</em> (considered the highest and best mantra and thus called the king of mantras, <em>mantrarāja</em> ) as resulting from the conjunction ( <em>samāyoga</em> ) of Śiva and Śakti and also from that of the pairs of male and female deities surrounding them. In this respect, too, the <em>śrīvidyā</em> is, like the <em>śrīcakra</em> , the place and the embodiment, and the result, of the “meeting” ( <em>saṁketa</em> ) of Śiva and Śakti.</p>
<p>Amṛtānanda interprets the term <em>Yoginī</em> as referring to the three goddesses Bhāratī, Pṛthivī, and Rudraṇī and to the three basic powers of Śiva, namely will, cognition, and activity ( <em>icchā</em> , <em>jñāna</em> , <em>kriyā</em> ); these entities, being feminine, correspond to the aspect of consciousness ( <em>vimarśāṁśa</em> ) of the Goddess. The Vīras, associated with the Yoginīs, are Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Rudra, who, being male, are aspects of the light of consciousness ( <em>prakāśāṁśa</em> ) aspect of the supreme godhead, who is considered to be in its fullness <em>prakāśāvimarśamaya</em> , both pure conscious light and supreme active consciousness. The Vīrendras, we are told by Amṛtānanda, transcend the cosmos, their nature being pure energy, and whereas the Yoginīs and the Vīras are considered to be present in the three <em>kūṭas</em> , the three groups of syllables of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , the Vīrendras are associated with the three <em>HRĪṂ</em> (here called <em>kāmakalā</em> ) which end the three <em>kūṭas.</em></p>
<p>We thus have to understand the <em>śrīvidyā</em> as pervaded by Śiva and Śakti together with their retinue of male and female ancillary deities. Being thus engendered and permeated by the united Śiva and Śakti and by their threefold</p>

<p><em>Encounter in the</em> Mantra* *</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>divine aspects, the <em>śrīvidyā</em> is a veritable embodiment of the Goddess as united with Śiva. This the adept must “know,” that is, experience, realize meditatively, the fact that the <em>vidyā</em> is the very self of the Goddess who is then to be worshipped. Neither the YH nor its commentary explains in what respect this worship is to be “freely” ( <em>svairam</em> ) performed. We may take it, perhaps, that it is to be performed with all the rites and off erings that will please and honor the deity and help the worshipper to identify with her.</p>
<p>In the next fi ve stanzas, the YH shows, fi rst, that the <em>śrīvidyā</em> encapsu-lates symbolically the creative power born from the interaction of Śiva and Śakti (that is, the Goddess surrounded by her retinue of secondary deities) ( <em>śl</em> . 19–20), this interaction being visibly manifested and experienced in the <em>kāmakalā</em> ( <em>śl.</em> 21). Then the supreme power is shown as abiding in the three <em>kūṭas</em> of the <em>vidyā</em> ( <em>śl.</em> 22), this omnipresent Goddess ( <em>śl.</em> 23a) having to be intensely meditated upon and understood.</p>
<p>[The Goddess], in mantra form, is thought [ <em>manana</em> ], made up of the knower and the known. She abides in the eternal Brahman in</p>
<p>the form of the conjunction of Śiva and Śakti on the plane where</p>
<p>[Śiva] adheres to the flow of his expansion which [ for him] is but an Indraic secondary trait. //19–20a//</p>
<p><em>śivaśaktyākhyasaṁghaṭṭarūpe brahmaṇi śāśvate</em> /</p>
<p><em>tatprathāprasarāśleṣabhuvi tvaindropalakṣite</em> //19//</p>
<p><em>jñātṛjñānamayākāramananān mantrarūpiṇī</em> /</p>
<p>The <em>śrīvidyā</em> is the Goddess in mantra form. She is thought ( <em>manana</em> ), intelligence or consciousness, a condition described as consisting of (or resulting from) the unifying interaction ( <em>saṁghaṭṭa</em> ) 5 of Śiva and Śakti, since the mantra is the locus of this interaction. Being divine, this interaction takes place on the supreme plane of the eternal Brahman, a plane where Śiva and Śakti, in their embrace and interpenetration, expand and transform themselves into (and therefore adhere to) the cosmos. The <em>śrīvidyā</em> is thus, like the <em>śrīcakra</em> , a symbolic form of the cosmic activity of the Goddess. This creative action of Śiva and Śakti is called “Indraic”</p>
<p>because, bringing about the universe which is ruled by <em>māyā</em> , it is similar to the action of the god Indra, who is conceived since the <em>ṛ</em> gveda 6 as taking up many forms thanks to his magical power, his <em>māyā</em> . This activity, too, though important, is nevertheless, for the supreme godhead, not a main trait but a secondary one.</p>
<p>66
The supreme energy is the mother of these [deities] taken</p>
<p>together. //20//</p>
<p><em>teṣāṁ samaṣṭirūpeṇa parāśaktis tu mātṛkā</em> //20//</p>
<p>The <em>śrīvidyā</em> as supreme power ( <em>parā śakti</em> ) made up of the coalescence of Śiva and Śakti appears thus as the mother of all the deities and of the cosmos, which issues from her. The term describing this creative aspect is <em>mātṛkā</em> , which denotes also the fifty phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet taken together, that is, the totality of the Word ( <em>mātṛkā</em> can also designate one of these phonemes, being in that case a synonym of <em>varṇa</em> or <em>akṣara</em> ).</p>
<p>The <em>śrīvidyā</em> is therefore described here as including, or being, both the whole pantheon and the whole universe and, implicitly, the totality of the Word: the three levels, that is, of <em>vāc</em> issuing from <em>paravāc</em> and going down to <em>vaikharī</em> . 7 This allows Amṛtānanda to end his commentary on the last half-stanza by saying: “What is expressed [ <em>vācaka</em> ] by the whole</p>
<p>mantra, 8 which is made up of the [male gods] Brahma and so forth and of the [ female ones] Bharatī, etc., is the total fusion [in the supreme godhead] of light [ <em>prakāśa</em> ] and consciousness [ <em>vimarśa</em> ] expanding as <em>paśyantī</em> , <em>madhyamā</em> , and <em>vaikharī</em> .” The <em>śrīvidyā</em> as a whole, we are to understand, is identical with the divine power insofar as she is the Word ( <em>vāc</em> ). She holds within herself all the forms and planes of the Word and all the deities and all the cosmos, which we saw in chapter 1 as present in the <em>śrīcakra</em> ; she is, phonetically, in a mantric form, what the <em>śrīcakra</em> is diagrammatically.</p>
<p>The interactive presence of Śiva and Śakti in the <em>śrīvidyā</em> is now shown as manifesting itself in a diagrammatic form as the <em>kāmakalā</em> :</p>
<p>[Held] between the middle <em>bindu</em> and the <em>visarga</em> , the supreme [power]</p>
<p>in her coiled form has space and <em>kalā</em> as refl ected image. //21//</p>

<p>According to Amṛtānanda (and Bhāskararāya), this stanza describes (or, rather, alludes to) the <em>kāmakalā</em> diagram (see fi gure 2.1). One can hardly say that the wording of this obscure stanza justifi es such an interpretation, which, however, is traditionally upheld in the Śrīvidyā system. It is as follows.</p>
<p>The supreme power, <em>śakti</em> , in her coiled form ( <em>kuṭilārūpaka</em> ), is the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> , which stretches between the “middle <em>bindu</em> and the <em>visarga</em> .” This is to say that she is inscribed within an upward-pointing triangle (a masculine symbol, that</p>

<p>of Śiva) on whose apex is a <em>bindu</em> and on each of whose two lower angles is also a <em>bindu</em> : two <em>bindus</em> , therefore, which make up a <em>visarga</em> whose written form is that of two dots (:). The upper <em>bindu</em> , it is said, is <em>kāma</em> , desire or passion; it is considered to be made up of the coalescence of the whole Sanskrit alphabet, from <em>A</em> to <em>HA</em> and as being the Sun. The <em>visarga</em> results from the division in two of <em>bindu</em> . It is the sixteenth “vowel” of the alphabet symbol-</p>
<p>izing the creative power 9 of <em>vāc,</em> its two dots being symbolically Moon and Fire. 10 It is <em>kalā</em> , that is, active power. Between these two, between <em>kāma</em> and <em>kalā</em> , extends the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> , which is graphically drawn as the letter <em>Ī</em> inscribed within a triangle pointing downward (a feminine symbol, that of Śakti). On the down-pointed apex of this triangle is the letter <em>HA</em> , or <em>hārdhakalā</em> , “the power of the half of <em>HA</em> ” (a term that denotes also the <em>visarga</em> ).</p>
<p>These two triangles with <em>kunḍalinī</em> located inside them are considered a symbol of the totality, from <em>A to HA</em> . They are also, mainly, a fi gure of the Goddess (sexually united with Śiva), her face being the “middle” upper <em>bindu</em> , the two lower <em>bindus</em> on the ends of the lower line of the masculine triangle being her two breasts, and the apex of the down-turned feminine triangle (where <em>HA</em> or <em>hārdhakalā</em> is) being her <em>yoni</em> . The shape of <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> , the letter <em>Ī</em> (or, rather, the <em>bījaīṂ</em> , since <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> is topped by the middle <em>bindu</em> ), evokes her coiled form. This <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> , says the YH, is refl ected by the two lower <em>bindus</em> , a statement not clearly explained by the commentators. Thus, this diagram, with <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> and the two superposed intersecting triangles, represents the co-presence of the sexually united Śiva and Śakti. 11</p>
<p>68
The interpretation of this stanza as a description of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> embodying the <em>kāmakalā</em> diagram, however arbitrary, is confi rmed by other works of the Tripurā tradition, such as Nāṭanānandanātha’s commentary on the seventh stanza of Puṇyānandanātha’s <em>Kāmakalāvilāsa</em> or the NṣA, 2.185–</p>
<p>186, with the commentaries of Śivānanda and Vidyānanda. It is also to be found in the <em>Gandharvatantra</em> , 30.37–64, which prescribes a visualization of <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> shaped as the letter <em>Ī Ṃ</em> extending in the yogic body of the adept from the <em>mūlādhāra</em> to the <em>brahmarandhra.</em></p>
<p>This is why she is described as supremely blissful and beautiful and animated by the <em>spanda</em> , the primordial vibration that creates and animates the universe.</p>
<p>The equally obscure next stanza is explained by the commentaries as describing the role played by the letters <em>A</em> and <em>HA</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> .</p>
<p>She holds herself in the central block [ <em>pinḍa</em> ] of the mantra in the sky of the primordial vibration [ formed by] the expansion of the central breath. Then, in the third block, //22// she fl ashes forth undivided in the <em>kūṭa</em> of Rahu. //23a//</p>
<p><em>madhyaprāṇaprathārūpaspandavyomni sthitā puna ḥ</em> /</p>
<p><em>madhyame mantrapiṇḍe tu tṛtīye piṇḍake puna ḥ</em> //22//</p>
<p><em>rāhukūṭādvayasphūrjat</em></p>
<p>The explanation given by the Dī of the fi rst sentence, which alludes to the middle section of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , called <em>kāmarāja</em> , identifi es the letter <em>HA</em> of this section of the mantra with the <em>HA</em> in the lower triangle of the <em>kāmakalā</em></p>
<p>diagram, since its says that it is placed between the two lower <em>bindus</em> of this fi gure. As in the <em>kāmakalā</em> , this <em>HA</em> is an aspect of the Goddess and, as such,</p>
<p>“expands,” being made up of the fulguration of the power of consciousness ( <em>vimarśaśakti</em> ), in the “fi rmament of the primordial cosmic vibration.”</p>
<p>Then one is to imagine that in the third subdivision ( <em>kūṭa</em> ) of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , the Goddess fl ashes in the letter <em>SA</em> of that group of phonemes made up of the letters <em>A</em> and <em>HA</em> , that is, the whole Sanskrit alphabet, which is also the totality of the Word ( <em>vāc</em> ).</p>
<p>The next two stanzas refer (in the same very obscure way) to the *śrīvidyā *</p>
<p>as a whole, expressing the cosmic power and role of the Goddess: When, in a state of palpitation, she is joined to the syllables expressing what is to be expressed [that is] <em>dharma</em> and <em>adharma</em> , made of poison and nectar, She is called Omniform.</p>

<p>69</p>
<p>[Thus,] by meditating intensely on the primordial power, the</p>
<p>Goddess made of three subdivisions, taking her either in her totality or in her constitutive parts, she who is the Mother, the supreme Power conjoining [in herself all] these [elements], one understands the natural sense [of the <em>vidyā</em> ]. //23b–25//</p>

<p><em>ādyāṁ śaktiṁ bhāvayanto bhāvārtha iti manvate</em> //25//</p>
<p>What is to be understood here is that the Goddess, taken to be made up of the three subdivisions ( <em>kūṭa</em> ) of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , is in a state of palpitation—</p>
<p>that is, active—because she is both the cosmos (meant here by <em>dharma</em> ) and its destruction (called here <em>adharma</em> ). The fi rst of these two aspects is called poison ( <em>viṣa</em> ), since the <em>saṁsāra</em> is poisonous for the ordinary mortal; the other, nectar ( <em>amṛta</em> , a term that, in Sanskrit, means immortality),</p>
<p>“is the death of death whose destruction is liberation” (Dī ) or immortality. Creation and destruction— <em>sṛśti and saṁhāra</em> —are the two sides of her cosmic activity symbolized by the <em>śrīvidyā.</em></p>
<p>As for the two syllables expressing this double notion, they are <em>A</em> , the fi rst letter of the alphabet usually considered to be what “expresses” Śiva, and <em>HA</em> , the last letter associated here with Śakti. This “natural sense”( <em>bhāvārtha</em> ) 12 of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> is what is to be understood through intense identifying meditation ( <em>bhāvanā</em> ).</p>
<p>The second meaning will now be expounded in stanzas 26–47. It is the one transmitted by tradition ( <em>sampradāya</em> ), that is, the secret knowledge received by the disciple from the mouth of his spiritual master.</p>
<p>Underlining the fact that the whole cosmic manifestation is pervaded ( <em>vyāpta</em> ) by the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , that is, by the united Śiva and Śakti, it shows how the phonetic elements that constitute it “express” (are the <em>vācakas</em> ), that is, evoke or denote and thus bring into existence and pervade the universe made up of the thirty-six <em>tattvas</em> , the three <em>guṇas</em> , the three sorts of knowers ( <em>pramātṛ</em>), the <em>prāṇas</em> , and the gods.</p>
<p>The <em>śrīvidyā</em> and the cosmos, in their structure and in their existence or function, are inseparably one. To understand the <em>vidyā</em> is thus to understand the universe and liberation, a knowledge obtained by</p>
<p><em>bhāvanā</em></p>
<p>70
( <em>śl.</em> 39), but only insofar as one receives it from an initiated master well versed in the traditional teaching, hence the name of this <em>artha</em> .</p>
<p>The oral tradition is the great knowledge present in the mouth of the spiritual master. The greatness of that which spreads [thus] in the form of the universe dwells in this [mouth]. //26//</p>
<p><em>sampradāyo mahābodharūpo gurumukhe sthita ḥ</em> /</p>
<p><em>viśvākāraprathāyās tu mahatvaṁ ca yad āśrayam</em> //26//</p>
<p>Repeating that the ultimate knowledge is to be transmitted secretly from the mouth of the master into the ear of the disciple, the Dī says that the knowledge thus transmitted is that of the real nature of the universe,</p>
<p>“which results from the transformation, in the form of the three <em>bījas</em> [of the <em>vidyā</em> ], of the complete fusion [of Śakti and] of the supreme Śiva, which can only be received from the mouth of the guru.”</p>
<p>This cosmic role of the <em>śrividyā</em> is fi rst underscored by the Tantra: Through the <em>mūlavidyā</em> , of which Śiva and Śakti are the primary</p>
<p>[cause], by her, O Parameśvarī! the whole universe is permeated.</p>
<p>Listen to this carefully, O Dear One! //27//</p>
<p><em>śivaśaktyādyayā mūlavidyayā parameśvari</em> /</p>
<p><em>jagatkṛtsnaṁ tayā vyāptaṁ śṛṇuṣāvahitā priye</em> //27//</p>
<p>Śiva is the letter <em>A</em> , and Śakti is <em>HA</em> ; the whole universe is therefore permeated by the totality of the Sanskrit alphabet, by the totality of the word with which the <em>mūlavidyā</em> , the “basic <em>vidyā</em> ,” the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , that is, is identifi ed.</p>
<p>The universe made of the fi ve elements is what [the Goddess] is made of, O Ever Eternal One! Such too is the <em>mūlavidyā</em> that I am telling you. //28//</p>
<p>From the letter <em>HA</em> space is born, from <em>KA,</em> wind, from RA fi re; from SA comes the <em>tattva</em> of water. //29// Earth is born from the letter <em>LA.</em></p>
<p>In this way [is made] this [reality] which contains the universe.</p>

<p><em>lakārāt pṛthivījātā tasmād viśvamayīca sā</em> /</p>
<p>The Goddess and her mantra are deemed to be made of the fi ve gross elements (the <em>bhūtas</em> ) constituting the gross, concrete level of the cosmos.</p>
<p>This is said to show that the universe as identical with the deity is meta-phorically present in the <em>śrīvidyā.</em></p>
<p><em>HA</em> , <em>KA</em> , <em>RA</em> , <em>SA</em> , and <em>LA</em> are, in all traditions, considered the <em>bījas</em> , the <em>vācakas</em> , of the fi ve gross elements. “Thus,” says the Dī , “the fi ve gross elements and the phonemes which express them are born in this way from the light and consciouness ( <em>prakāśa</em> and <em>vimarśa</em> ) which form the supreme Reality whose nature is the total fusion of Śiva and Śakti. The nature of this supreme <em>vidyā</em> is the total fusion of these two [aspects of the deity]. In other terms, she is made of the phonemes that compose her and of the universe [that they ‘express’].” The Dī then quotes stanzas 9, 10, 13, and 14</p>
<p>of Puṇyānanda’s <em>Kāmakalāvilāsa</em> . 13</p>
<p>It is said that the fi fteen <em>guṇas</em> of the gross elements [are also found there]. Thus formed, she is favorable. //30//</p>
<p><em>guṇā ḥ pañcadaśa proktā bhūtānāṁ tanmayīśivā</em> //30//</p>
<p>There are, in fact, only three <em>guṇas</em> : <em>sattva</em> , <em>rajas</em> , and <em>tamas</em> (goodness, passion, and darkness). This number could be explained by the fact that there are fi ve gross elements ( <em>bhūtas</em> ), which would result in 5 x 3 = 15. But the commentary explains this number by the fact that the <em>bhūtas</em> “interpen-etrate mutually”; that is, the higher ones are present in those that follow, which results in 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 <em>guṇas</em> . This is a peculiar conception, not the generally admitted one of the Sāṁkhya, for whom the gross elements issue from the subtle ones ( <em>tanmātra</em> ). Fifteen, however is the number of the phonemes of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> . There are, therefore, two series of fi fteen elements.</p>
<p>In any object one can say that there is energy [ <em>śakti</em> ]. This [energy]</p>
<p>is the Goddess, the universal sovereign. And any object is the</p>
<p>supreme Lord. //31//</p>

<p>that exists, from Śiva to the earth, whereas all that is object is the supreme Lord, the supreme Śiva. These two, he adds, take on in the <em>vidyā</em> the aspect of objects (the fi fteen male <em>guṇas</em> of the fi ve <em>tattvas</em> ) and that of the fi fteen (female) phonemes of the <em>vidyā</em> . The basic male-female dichotomy is therefore present in the <em>vidyā</em> . This, however, includes other elements: This <em>vidyā</em> , made up of the elements and the <em>guṇas</em> , is pervaded by fi fteen phonemes [namely] by fi ve, then six and four syllables. //32//</p>
<p><em>vyāptā pañcadaśārṇai ḥ sā vidyā bhūtaguṇātmikā</em> /</p>
<p><em>pañcabhiś ca tathāṣaḍbhiś caturbhir api cākṣarai ḥ</em> //32//</p>
<p>These three groups of syllables are those of the three <em>kūṭas</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , which have six, then fi ve, then four syllables. These phonemes are said to pervade the <em>vidyā</em> , since she is made up in her totality of these fi fteen letters.</p>
<p>If she is parceled up into vowels and consonants, she is divided into thirty-seven. If divided into thirty-seven, she is formed of the thirty-six <em>tattvas</em> , //33// her essential nature transcending the <em>tattvas</em> . This <em>vidyā</em> , one must ceaselessly meditate.</p>
<p><em>svaravyañjanabhedena saptatriṁśatprabhedinī</em> /</p>
<p><em>saptatriṁśatprabhedenaṣaṭtriṁśattattvarūpiṇī</em> //33//</p>
<p><em>tattvātītasvabhāvā ca vidyaiṣā bhāvyate sadā</em></p>
<p>If we divide the <em>vidyā</em> into vowels and consonants, we have eleven letters in the fi rst <em>kūṭa</em> , thirteen in the second, and nine in the third; thirty-three phonemes to which are to be added the three <em>bindus</em> which crown the three <em>HRĪṂ</em> ; thirty-seven in all. 14 Divided in this way, the <em>vidyā</em> can be considered as made up symbolically of the thirty-six <em>tattvas</em> and thus to have the same nature as these cosmic divisions of the universe. The <em>śrīvidyā</em></p>
<p>is the Goddess in her cosmic activity, carried out by the <em>tattvas</em> , which she dominates, transcends, being in this sense a thirty-seventh <em>tattva</em> . Her essential nature, says Amṛtānanda, is that of Śiva, and it is as such that she is to be meditated ( <em>bhāvyate</em> ). 15</p>
<p>The Dī quotes here the fi</p>
<p>rst twenty-seven stanzas of the</p>
<p><em>Saubhāgyasudhodaya</em> , which describe the cosmic creative activity of the deity as Śakti, and the divisions and aspects of this work. The passage is interesting but is too long and needs too many explanations to be quoted here.</p>
<p>74
The YH now considers again the fi fteen elements and the three <em>guṇas</em> previously mentioned in <em>śl.</em> 32:</p>
<p>In the elements earth, etc., each element that is above is pervading,</p>
<p>//34// the one below is pervaded. / This is why the <em>guṇas</em> whose receptacles are the pervading [elements] are in those which are pervaded, O Goddess! being [themselves] divided into gross and subtle. //35//</p>
<p><em>pṛthivyādiṣu bhūteṣu vyāpakaṁ cottarottaram</em> //34//</p>
<p><em>bhūtaṁ tvadhastanaṁ vyāpyaṁ tadguṇā vyāpakāśrayā ḥ</em> /</p>
<p><em>vyāpyeṣvavasthitā devi sthūlasūkṣmavibhedata ḥ</em> //35//</p>
<p>Thus, sound, the <em>guṇa</em> of space, pervades the [gross elements] air, etc., the fi vefold sound [present in these elements] being denoted by the <em>bījas</em> of space which are in the <em>vidyā</em> . //36//</p>
<p>Of these [fi ve sounds], what stays in addition as [their] cause is made of <em>dhvani</em> . [The phoneme <em>HA</em> ] must be [understood as being] the seed of those that carry the <em>guṇas</em> and also as that which expresses the <em>guṇas</em> . //37// The fact that they have [respectively] the nature of cause and eff ect shows their unity.</p>
<p><em>tasmād vyomaguṇa ḥ śabdo vayvādīn vyāpyā saṁsthita ḥ</em> /</p>
<p><em>vyomabījais tu vidyāsthair lakṣayecchabdapañcakam</em> //36//</p>
<p><em>teṣāṁ kāraṇarūpeṇa sthitaṁ dhvanimayaṁ param</em> /</p>
<p><em>bhaved guṇavatāṁ bījaṁ guṇanām api vācakam</em> //37//</p>
<p><em>kāryakāraṇabhāvena tayor aikyaṁ vivakṣayā</em> /</p>
<p>What is to be understood here seems to be that each subtle element is present in the corresponding gross element but also that a gross element</p>
<p>may be present in another one becoming subtle with regard to it. 16 The so-called <em>bījas</em> of space ( <em>vyomabīja</em> ) denoting the fi ve elements are the fi ve letters <em>HA</em> present in the three sections of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> . The element added to these fi ve <em>HA</em> is, according to Amṛtānanda, the sixth <em>HA</em> of the <em>vidyā</em> , that is, the <em>HA</em> of the third <em>kūṭa</em> , placed between the <em>KA</em> and the <em>LA</em> of the <em>kāmarājakūṭa</em> . This <em>HA</em> is, for some reason, considered to be “made of <em>dhvani</em> ,” that is, embodying a subtle form of sound, which would explain why it is the cause of the fi ve other ones.</p>
<p>The YH continues by expounding the links that exist between the <em>guṇas</em> , the gross elements ( <em>bhūta</em> ), and the letters deemed to “express” them:</p>

<p><em>Encounter in the</em> Mantra* *</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>One must meditate intensely, O Goddess! on the apparition of the</p>
<p>[elements] air, fi re, water, and earth, distinguishing the gross from the subtle ones, and on that of [the <em>guṇas</em> of ] contact [which pervade them] as originating all from the three Mahāmāyā and from the</p>
<p><em>bindu</em> which is their origin. //38b–39//</p>
<p><em>mahāmāyātrayeṇāpi kāraṇena ca bindunā</em> //38//</p>
<p><em>vāyvagnijalabhūmīnāṁ sparśanāṁ ca catuṣṭayam</em> /</p>
<p><em>utpannaṁ bhāvayed devi sthūlasūkṣmavibhedata ḥ</em> //39//</p>
<p>The Mahāmāyās are the letters <em>Ī</em> of the three <em>HRĪṂ</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , the <em>bindus</em> being the three <em>Ṃ</em> s.</p>
<p>The three [ <em>guṇas</em> ] of [the <em>tattva</em> of ] form [ <em>rūpa</em> ] are to be meditated on in the same manner using the three <em>RA.</em> Their essential part has the form of fi re. [They are] indeed engendered by this <em>bīja</em> . //40//</p>
<p><em>rūpāṇāṁ tritayaṁ tadvat tribhīrephair vibhavitam</em> /</p>
<p><em>pradhānaṁ tejaso rūpaṁ tadbījena tu janyate</em> //40//</p>
<p>These three <em>guṇas</em> are those found in the <em>tattvas</em> of earth, water, and fi re. <em>RA</em> , to be used to meditate them, is the <em>bīja</em> of fi re, since their essential part is fi re. This implies the presence of form in these three <em>tattvas</em> .</p>
<p>According to the Dī : “The three gu <em>ṇas</em> of form, which is the <em>guṇa</em> of fi re, having been [described as] denoted by the phonemes which are the <em>vācaka</em> of fi re, the <em>guṇa</em> of water is now described by the phonemes that are the <em>vācakas</em> of that element.”</p>
<p>Taste, both subtle and gross, is evoked through the lunar <em>bījas</em> present in the <em>vidyā.</em> In this world also one knows the association of <em>rasa</em> and <em>amṛta</em> . //41//</p>
<p><em>vidyāsthaiṣcandrabījais tu sthūla ḥ sūkṣmo rasa ḥ smṛta ḥ</em> /</p>
<p><em>saṁbandho vidito loke rasasyāpi amṛtasya ca</em> //41//</p>
<p>The lunar <em>bījas</em> are the letters <em>SA</em> of the three <em>kuṭas</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , the letter <em>SA</em> often being given the name <em>candra</em> (moon). Taste is the <em>guṇa</em> of water. It is therefore in its natural gross form in the <em>tattva</em> of water, which is taken to be pervading; in the <em>tattva</em> of earth, which is pervaded, it is subtle, the Dī explains.</p>
<p>It also explains (more comprehensibly) that according to the Purāṇas, the</p>
<p>76
<em>amṛta</em> appeared from the water of the ocean when it was churned by the gods and the <em>asuras</em> . Hence the link between these two elements.</p>
<p>The <em>guṇa</em> of the earth is smell. Its letter is that which expresses smell. The threefold nature [of this letter] is to the result of the link existing between the three worlds, O Maheśvarī! //42//</p>
<p><em>vasundharāguṇo gandhas tallipir gandhavācikā</em> /</p>
<p><em>bhuvanatrayasaṁbandhāt tridhātvaṁ tu maheśvari</em> //42//</p>
<p>The <em>bīja</em> of earth is <em>LA</em> , and it is denoted by one <em>LA</em> only, whereas there are three <em>LA</em> in the <em>śrividyā.</em> If one were to object to this fact, the Dī answers: there are three worlds ( <em>lokatraya</em> ) in the universe, which are mutually supporting and supported, and, because of that, the earth is also considered triple though being one.</p>
<p>The other body in the three [sorts of ] conscious subjects—pure, impure, and mixed—is manifested by the triple <em>krodhīśa</em> present in the <em>vidyā</em> . //43//</p>
<p><em>aśuddhaśuddhamiśrāṇāṁ pramātṛṇāṁ paraṁ vapu ḥ</em> /</p>
<p><em>krodhīśatritayenātha vidyāsthena prakāśyate</em> //43//</p>
<p>The triple <em>krodhīśa</em> are the three letters <em>KA</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> . They denote the three sorts of conscious subjects ( <em>pramātṛ</em> ), which represent three dif-ferent levels or modes of consciousness. They are, says Amṛtānanda, the <em>vijṇānākalā</em> , who suff er only the <em>āṇavamalā</em> , the innate impurity of the soul (the <em>aṇu</em> ), their minds being already purifi ed and in essence like Śiva; then the <em>pralayākala</em> , bound souls who will be endlessly reborn to “burn” their <em>karman</em> till the next <em>pralaya</em> ; and the <em>sakala</em> , who are bound by all the fetters of this world. 17</p>
<p>Just as the ten <em>śrīkaṇṭhas</em> are that which expresses the nonmanifested, O Goddess! so the eleventh remains in the form of breath, the other one //44// is the <em>puruṣa</em> : being unique, he becomes multiple.</p>
<p><em>śrīkaṇṭhadaśakaṁ tadvad avyaktasya hi vācakam</em> /</p>
<p><em>prāṇarūpa ḥ sthito devi tadvad ekādaśa ḥ para ḥ</em> //44//</p>

<p>77</p>
<p>The ten <em>śrīkaṇṭhas</em> are the ten letters <em>A</em> of the twelve syllables that form the <em>śrīvidyā</em> (which are twelve if one excludes the three *HRĪṂ * ). The nonmanifest ( <em>avyakta</em> ) which these the letters express is, says the Dī , the vital principle, the *jīva, * of the human individual bound by the senses linked to the inert, insentient ( <em>jaḍa</em> ), not illuminated by divine Consciousness. The other one, linked to the two other <em>A</em> , is the <em>puruṣa</em> , the supreme soul, Śiva, who is, in fact, unique but becomes multiple by his infi nite appearances and by being present in the vital breath of all living beings.</p>
<p>The deities named Rudra,</p>
<p>Ī śvara, and Sadeśa, limited [divine]</p>
<p>forms, are invoked by the three <em>bindus</em> . The totally unlimited forms, those of Śanti, Śakti, and Śambhu , are denoted by the three <em>nādas</em> .</p>

<p>*bindutrayeṇa kathitā amitāmitavigrahā ḥ * /</p>
<p>*śānti ḥ śaktiśca śambhuś ca nādatritayabodhana ḥ * //46//</p>
<p>The Dī , referring for that to the <em>Svacchandasaṁgraha</em> , expatiates on the role of the deities enumerated in this stanza. Rudra, it says, presides over the <em>tattva</em> of fi re, in which are the fi ve <em>tattvas</em> from <em>puruṣa</em> to <em>māyā</em> , the <em>tattvas śuddhavidyā</em> , *sadāśiva, * and <em>ī śvara</em> depending from the <em>tattva</em> air. Being linked to <em>tattvas</em> , these three deities are limited in time and scope. They are invoked by the three <em>bindus</em> which “crown”</p>
<p>the <em>M</em> of the three *HRĪṂ * of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> . The three unlimited divine forms, Śānti, Śakti, and Śambhu (Śiva), are denoted (have for <em>vācaka</em> ) three *nādas. * Śānti is thus the not-manifest subtle sound ( <em>avyaktadhvani</em> ) produced in the <em>brahmarandhra cakra</em> , where all the highest energies are deemed to be appeased; one thus shifts here from syllables of the mantra to the body of the adept. Śakti is the highest aspect of <em>śaktitattva</em> , Śambhu being the *śivatattva. *</p>
<p>The YH concludes the section on the <em>bhāvārtha</em> as follows: As the threads of a net are gathered in its initial thread, in the same way the mantras are all found together in the <em>vidyā</em> . //47//</p>
<p>*vāgurāmūlavalaye sūtrādyā ḥ kavalīkṛtā ḥ * /</p>
<p>*tathā mantrā ḥ samastāś ca viyāyām atra saṁsthitā ḥ * //47//</p>
<p>78
The Dī explains that the net alluded to here is a net for catching fi sh, the threads of whose mesh are gathered at their “root” in a metal ring from which they, as it were, issue forth. In the same way, the <em>vaikari</em> , manifested form of the word, of all uttered mantras, and, of course, the <em>śrīvidyā</em> when made use of, is gathered initially in the supreme, <em>parā</em> , plane of the Word, <em>vāc</em> .</p>
<p>Then comes the so-called traditional meaning ( <em>saṁpradāyārtha</em> ), which is transmitted through the (oral) teachings of the succession of spiritual masters of the Śrīvidyā school ( <em>gurūpadeśakrameṇa</em> ). In this respect, this <em>artha</em> does not bring anything new, as appears from its being expounded in one half- <em>śloka</em> :</p>
<p>[The meaning] that one can attain through the succession of spiritual masters is called the traditional meaning.</p>
<p>*gurukrameṇa saṁprāpta ḥ sampradāyārthaīritha ḥ * /</p>
<p>The Dī quotes here a long (unidentifi</p>
<p>ed) passage from the</p>
<p><em>Svacchandabhairavatantra</em></p>
<p>which describes how the teaching issuing</p>
<p>from the supreme “transmental” ( <em>unmanā</em> ) plane of the divinity or of the Word ( <em>vāc</em> ) goes through several lower divine planes down to the god Śrīkaṇṭ ha, who then reveals it to human masters. Śrīkaṇṭ ha, we note here, is not one of the fi ve masters of the <em>divyaugha</em> , the “flow of divine masters” of the Śrīvidyā tradition in the <em>pāraṁparas</em> given by Śivānanda, Vidyānanda, and Amṛtānanda. This can be explained by the fact that the <em>Svacchandabhairava</em> , which is often referred to in the Dī , is not—</p>
<p>if we identify it with the <em>Svacchandatantra</em> —a Tantra of the Śrīvidyā.</p>
<p>Concluding on the subject, Amṛtānanda says: “Whoever who, ignorant of the exact meaning of the words and of the tradition, would, without attending the teaching of a master, try to discover alone the meaning of the words as one can do for the stanzas of the Purāṇas and so forth, shall never be able to fi nd it.”</p>
<p>The next meaning is the inner or secret ( <em>nigarbha</em> ) one. It is not merely alluded to but briefl y considered:</p>
<p>As for the inner meaning, O Great Goddess! it is an experience (or perception) of Śiva, the spiritual master and the self. //48//</p>

<p>*Encounter in the * Mantra * *</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>This sense is secret and/or inner ( <em>nigarbha</em> ) 18 insofar as Śiva is transcendent, unattainable by thought and word. The spiritual master considers Śiva his own inner transcendent self, this same omnipresent self being also the self of the disciple, who is to have a personal inner experience of this full omnipresent pure divine Consciousness, “all his fetters having been destroyed by the compassionate gaze of the guru” (Dī , p. 174). This</p>
<p>“sense”—this experience, that is—of the <em>vidyā</em> , concludes the Dī , consists in “the concentration of the mind [ <em>anusandhāna</em> ] on the experience of the unity of Śiva, the master, and the self.” But how is one to concentrate on this unity? The answer is:</p>
<p>I give you only a mere indication of how it is done, O Mistress of the gods! [A fusion] of this sort results from the one-pointed attention on the unity of Śiva, the guru, and the self. //49//</p>
<p><em>tatprakāraṁ ca deveśi diṅmātreṇa vadāmi te</em> /</p>
<p><em>śivagurvātmanāṁ aikyānusandhānāt tadātmakam</em> //49//</p>
<p>Namely:</p>
<p>Having understood that there is no division within Śiva and that the spiritual master has the same quality, the [disciple], bent down in devotion, unsullied by the presence of contraction, must realize thanks to the power of the gaze of his master that he has himself the nature of Śiva. //50–51a//</p>
<p><em>niṣkalatvaṁ śive buddhvā tadrūpatvaṁ guror api</em></p>
<p><em>tannirīkṣaṇasamarthyād ātmanaś ca śivātmatām</em> //50//</p>
<p><em>bhāvayed bhaktinamra ḥ san śaṅkonmeṣākalaṅkita ḥ /</em></p>
<p>The general meaning of this stanza is clear. The term “contraction”( <em>saṁkoca</em> ) may, however, surprise the reader. The Dī explains that it is the condition of a person whose mind is attached to the life in this world, this condition being revealed ( <em>unmeṣa</em> ) by the pleasure one fi nds in “such external objects as wife, son, and the like.” More philosophically, it is the state of the soul that has lost its original omnipresence and freedom.</p>
<p>The saving power of the gaze ( <em>nirīkṣaṇa</em> ) of the master which “falls”( <em>katākṣapāta</em>) on his disciple—one also says</p>

theme. The practice is also used ritually: <em>nirīkṣaṇa</em> is one of a group of four purifying rites in Śaiva ritual.</p>
<p>We may also note here the attitude of devotion ( <em>bhakti</em> ), both mental and bodily, prescribed to the adept: a <em>tāntrika</em> is not merely a ritualist and a yogin; he is also a devotee.</p>
<p>The next <em>artha</em> is expounded in the next seventeen stanzas. Although it is complex, it is not diffi</p>
<p>cult to understand:</p>
<p>I will now tell you the <em>kaulika</em> meaning: it is the unity of the <em>cakra</em> and the deity, //51// the *vidyā, * the spiritual master, and the self.</p>
<p>What this [unity] consists of will be shown.</p>
<p>The four-sided lines [are born] from the letters <em>LA</em> . The two lotuses, which are fi re and moon and are accompanied by a triple circle, are born from [the phonemes of ] energy, O Dear One! From the letters numbering nine which form the three *hṛllekhā * //53// [when] joined to three <em>bindus</em> is born the <em>cakra</em> with nine <em>yonis</em> , O Dear One!</p>
<p>The <em>cakra</em> that is in contact with the triple circle and which is fi re and energy //54// is born only from the triple <em>bīja</em> of space.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the triple subject, associated with the three</p>
<p>“intoxicatings,” will, knowledge, and activity, //55// is the throne of Sadāśiva, O Goddess! constituted by the <em>mahābindu</em> , supreme. This is why the nature of the <em>cakra</em> is that of the mantra.</p>

<p>In these stanzas, the YH goes on describing the mutually interwo-ven condition and interdependence of the <em>śricakra</em> and the <em>śrīvidyā</em> . This is shown by saying that the diff erent parts of the <em>cakra</em> are born from</p>

<p>diff erent letters of the <em>vidyā</em> . The four-sided fi gure is the external square enclosure of the <em>cakra</em> made of three lines—hence the plural ( <em>caturasrāṇi</em> ) form used. The “energy phonemes” are the letters <em>SA</em> of the three <em>kūṭas</em> , this being justifi ed by a quotation from a Tantra: “Śiva is <em>HA</em> , Śakti is *SA. * ”</p>
<p>As for the two lotuses, the outer one with sixteen petals is <em>soma</em> , a usual designation of the moon, the number sixteen being a lunar number. 19 The letters numbering nine are the three letters <em>H</em> , <em>R</em> , *Ī * of each of the three *HRĪṂ * (here called <em>hṛllekhā</em> , “the letter *HRĪṂ * ”), the <em>bindu</em> joined to them being the *Ṃ * of *HRĪṂ . *</p>
<p>We have seen the <em>navayoni cakra</em> in chapter 1. The <em>cakra</em> that is in contact with the triple circle is the <em>cakra</em> of twelve triangles inside which are the two other <em>cakras</em> of, respectively, fourteen and ten triangles, all three being deemed to issue from the three <em>bījas</em> of space, that is, the three <em>HA</em> .</p>
<p>The throne of energy is the central triangle, the three “intoxicating” (or maddening) phonemes being the letters <em>KA</em> deemed to be the phonetic aspect of the subjects submitted to the powers of will, knowledge, and activity.</p>
<p>But if the <em>cakra</em> is identical with the mantra, it is also, fundamentally, an aspect of the Goddess. The YH, therefore, says:</p>
<p>It is the other body of the deity. //56//</p>
<p>*devatāyā ḥ paraṁ vapu ḥ * //56//</p>
<p>The Dī refers here to stanza 55 of the fi rst chapter, which says that the <em>cakra</em> is “the cosmic body of the Goddesss all surrounded by the sparkling waves of her multitudinous power.” This cosmic aspect of the Goddess (which we will fi nd again in the third chapter, beginning at *śl. * 9, where the Gaṇeśas, etc., are placed by <em>nyāsa</em> on the body of the worshipper) consists of deities (Gaṇas, Yoginīs, Ḍ ākinīs, etc.), breaths, and aspects of the word, shown as linked to diff erent parts of the <em>vidyā</em> . The mantra brings together all these inseparably divine and human realities.</p>
<p>That the Goddess could, while always supreme and unique, appear as so many diff erent epiphanies should not surprise us. The multiple aspects of deities go back to the Veda; it gives an expression to the diversity of their power. This multiplication, which implies the multiplication of sanctuaries, concretizes (today and in the past) the omnipresence of a deity on the Indian soil, sacred space being delimitated by their sanctuaries.</p>
<p>This totality is shown as follows:</p>
<p>82
In addition, since her nature is that of one hundred and eleven deities, the Great Goddess has the supremacy over the <em>gaṇas</em> ; further, because of the fact that will, cognition, and activity, together with moon, sun, and fi re, are associated with the three <em>guṇas</em> , this Goddess has a planetary aspect. //56b–58a//</p>

<p>The one hundred and eleven deities—called “troups” (</p>
<p><em>gaṇas</em> ) 20 —</p>
<p>are those surrounding Tripurasundarī, abiding in the nine parts of the <em>śrīcakra</em> , from Kāmeśvara and Kāmeśvarī, in the center, to the Mudrās and Siddhis, in the outer square. We have already met them in the fi rst chapter and will see their worship in chapter 3. The Goddess, says Amṛtānanda, is both the deities of the <em>cakra</em> and the totality of the deities, of the Godhead. As such, she is the three basic energies, will, knowledge, and activity, in the powers symbolized by the three luminaries ( <em>dhāman</em> ), 21 moon, sun, and fi re, and is also the nine planets, the <em>grahas</em> . 22</p>
<p>Her aspect as constellations comes from the senses of apperception and action as well as from their objects, O Mistress of the gods!</p>
<p>from the internal organs, from <em>prakṛti</em> and from the <em>guṇas</em> and from the self and the state of <em>pumān</em> . //58b–60a//</p>

<p>The Goddess as mantra takes on the aspects or nature of the</p>
<p>twenty-seven constellations ( <em>nakṣatra</em> ); 23 these astral aspects are corre-</p>
<p>lated, in the <em>vidyā</em> , with the <em>tattvas</em> , enumerated here going from the fi ve faculties of action (speech, grasping, evacuation, copulation, movement), the fi ve senses of apperception (hearing, contact, seeing, taste, smell), their ten objects (the subtle and gross elements: the fi ve <em>tanmātras</em> and the fi ve <em>bhūtas</em> ), and then the internal organs, <em>manas</em> , <em>ahamkāra</em> , <em>buddhi</em> , plus <em>prakriti</em> and <em>puruṣa</em> and the <em>guṇas</em> . The Dī concludes: “It is because</p>

<p>these twenty-seven [elements] make up her constitutive parts that the Goddess appears as the constellations, an aspect she takes on of her own free will.”</p>
<p>[Her] nature of Yoginī is now expounded. Because of the Ḍ ākinis, etc., mistresses of the body elements, the skin, etc., she is associated with the eight Yoginīs presiding over the eight groups of phonemes. Assuming the condition of the Yoginīs, she shines forth, having the world as her form. //60a–61//</p>

<p>*yoginīrūpam āsthāya rājate viśvavigrahā * //61//</p>
<p>The elements that constitute the human body ( <em>dhātu</em> ) number traditionally seven: skin, blood, fl esh, fat, marrow, semen, bones. The Dī</p>
<p>quotes only six, omitting bones. Their number does not coincide with that of the Yoginīs which are, says Amṛtānanda, Ḍ ākinī, Rākinī, Lākinī, Kākinī, Śākinī, and Hākinī. These deities, generally collectively called Ḍ ākinīs, are traditionally associated with the bodily elements. Here they come together with the eight Yoginīs, which are, in fact, the eight Mothers (Mātṛor Mātṛkā), Brahmī, and so on, traditionally considered the regents of the eight groups of phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet. 24 Together, these Yoginīs, says the Dī , embody or stand for the totality of the cosmos.</p>
<p>It adds: “the Goddess plays in the form of these Yoginīs.”</p>
<p>Then follows another aspect taken up by the Goddess:</p>
<p>[The ten breaths,] <em>prāṇā</em> , <em>apāna</em> , <em>samāna</em> , <em>vyāna</em> , <em>udāna</em> , <em>nāga</em> , <em>kūrma</em> , <em>kṛkāra</em> , <em>devadatta</em> , and <em>dhanañjaya</em> , along with the individual soul and the supreme Self—it is through them that she assumes a zodiacal nature. //62–63a//</p>

<p>*jīvātmaparamātmā cety etair rāśisvarūpiṇī * /</p>
<p>This series of ten vital breaths ( <em>prāṇa</em> ) is a current one. Together with the individual soul, or vital principle ( <em>jīvātman</em> ), and the supreme soul, <em>paramātman</em> , they number twelve, like the signs of the zodiac, which are the same in India as in the West, from which they were borrowed by the Indians.</p>
<p>The next aspect is less evident:</p>
<p>84
The great <em>vidyā</em> made of supreme Word and of the other [three levels of the Word], having as nature the triple group [of phonemes] <em>A</em> , <em>KA</em> , <em>THA</em> , and the other ones, becomes mistress of the <em>gaṇas</em> , starting with the third [of these groups]. //63b–64a//</p>
<p>*akathāditripaṅktyātmā tārtīyādikrameṇa sā * //63//</p>
<p><em>gaṇeśo ‘bhūn mahāvidyā parāvāgādivāṅmayī</em> /</p>
<p>The Sanskrit alphabet, from <em>A</em> to <em>HA</em> , is the totality of the Word ( <em>vāc</em> ) which—in the view of most Tantric traditions—is considered as existing on four levels: <em>parā</em> , the supreme; <em>paśyantī</em> , the visionary; <em>madhyamā</em> , the intermediate; and the plane of the gross, empirical speech, of discursive thought, <em>vaikharī</em> . 25 <em>A</em> here designates the sixteen vowels, the fi rst of which is <em>A</em> ; <em>KA</em> stands for the sixteen consonants from <em>KA</em> to <em>TA</em> ; <em>THA</em> is for the sixteen letters from <em>THA</em> to <em>SA</em> . The <em>A</em> group is considered to be included in the last <em>kūṭa</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , the <em>śaktibīja</em> ; the <em>KA</em> group is in the middle <em>kūṭa</em> , <em>kāmarāja</em> ; and the <em>THA</em> group is in the fi rst *kūṭa, vāgbhava. * The totality of the alphabet is thus present in the whole <em>śrīvidyā</em> .</p>
<p>When in the three <em>kūtas</em> [in the form] of <em>bīja</em> , <em>bindu</em> , and <em>dhvani</em> , she takes on the nature of the planets. //64b//</p>
<p>[When made of her] syllables numbering fi fteen: the three</p>
<p><em>hṛllekhas</em> and the twelve other phonemes, her form is that of the constellations. //65//</p>

<p>*anyair dvādaśabhir varṇair eṣā nakṣatrarūpiṇī * //65//</p>
<p>Since there are three elements, <em>bīja</em> , <em>bindu</em> , and <em>dhvani</em> , in each of the three <em>kūṭas</em> , the total is nine, which is the number of the <em>grahas</em> . <em>Bīja</em> , the commentary explains, is the <em>HRī</em> of the three <em>kūṭas</em> , <em>bindu</em> being the *Ṃ * and <em>nāda</em> the subtle phonic vibration that ends the *HRĪṂ . *</p>
<p>As for the <em>nakṣatras</em> , which number twenty-seven, this number is obtained by counting fi rst the fi fteen phonemes of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> (fi fteen being also the number of the lunar days, the <em>tithis</em> ), 26 then its twelve phonemes without the three *HRĪṂ . * “Thus,” concludes the Dī , “the *vidyā * in the form of constellations being formed by fi fteen and twelve phonemes, we get twenty-seven in all.”</p>

<p>The state of Yoginīof the <em>vidyā</em> [results from] six syllables: [those of ]</p>

<p>The syllables of energy are the three *HRĪṂ * ; what precedes them are the three letters <em>LA</em> , the total of six being reached if one counts the *HRĪṂ *</p>
<p>as one syllable only. The aspect of energy of the Goddess is that of the six Yoginīs, Ḍ ākinī, and so on, that we have already seen.</p>
<p>For the twelve signs of the zodiac, one counts the syllables of the <em>vidyā</em></p>
<p>without the three *HRĪṂ * .</p>
<p>Maheśvarī[when] in the form of the <em>cakra</em> [has] in the same way a cosmic aspect. //67a//</p>
<p><em>evaṁ viśvaprakārā ca cakrarūpā maheśvarī</em> /</p>
<p>The <em>śrīcakra</em> , along with the <em>śrividyā</em> , is the Goddess in her cosmic activity.</p>
<p>All the forms we have just seen taken over by her as the <em>vidyā</em> —as mistress of the <em>gaṇas</em> , and so on—she also assumes when in the form of the <em>cakra</em> .</p>
<p>The Dī tells which parts of the <em>śrīcakra</em> are to be associated with the diff erent aspects ( <em>gaṇas</em> , planets, constellations, etc.) quoted in stanzas 57–66:</p>
<p>[All the aspects just] described as in the body of the Goddess [are to be found] in the same way in the body of the spiritual master, and, through his grace, the disciple will also shine in this form. //67b–68a//</p>
<p><em>devyā dehe yathā prokto gurudehe tathaiva hi</em> //67//</p>
<p><em>tatprasādāc ca śiṣyo ‘pi tadrūpa ḥ saṁprakāśate</em> /</p>
<p>The body of the Goddess Tripurasundarī, says Amṛtānanda, is the one she has assumed, in her play, of her own free will ( <em>svecchāgṛhīta-līlāvigraha</em> ).</p>
<p>The nature of the guru, he adds, being that of the deity’s body, the deity is also in his body. And this is also to be found in the body of the disciple, who “having benefi ted from the grace of his master, shines, like him, like the deity.” We note here again the importance always given in Tantric traditions to the grace bestowed by the spiritual master, which replicates on</p>
<p>86
the human level the movement of the divine grace ( <em>anugraha</em> ), also called</p>
<p>“descent of the [divine] energy” ( <em>śaktipāta</em> ).</p>
<p>Thus is said the <em>kaulika</em> meaning, O Perfect One! Celebrated by the heroes. //68//</p>
<p>I will tell you also the most secret of all meanings, O Perfect One!</p>
<p><em>ity evaṁ kaulikārthas tu kathito vīravandite</em> //68//</p>
<p><em>tathā sarvarahasyārthaṁ kathayāmi tavānaghe</em> /</p>
<p>This interpretation of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> is the most secret one, says the Dī , because thanks to it, the disciple may attain the supreme ( <em>para</em> ). It is, in fact, a yogic practice.</p>
<p>The *vidyā * having taken on, in the <em>mūlādhāra</em> , the condition of the <em>vāgbhava</em> , similar to lightning, //69b// her body being made of fifty phonemes associated with thirty-eight <em>kalās</em> , in the form of the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> , pierces the three <em>maṇḍalas</em> . //70// Shining like ten million fl ashes of lightning, shaped like a lotus fi ber, she attaches herself to the <em>maṇḍala</em> of the moon of the inner sky, her nature being that of a flow of nectar //71// of which she pervades the whole universe, her nature being constant bliss. The thought: “this energy is my own self,” such is the secret meaning, O Maheśvarī! //72//</p>

<p>The term <em>vāgbhava</em> here does not designate the fi rst <em>kūṭa</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā</em></p>
<p>but the condition ( <em>bhava</em> ) of the Word ( <em>vāc</em> ) whose fourfold division we have seen above ( <em>śl</em> . 63). The <em>vidyā</em> is thus identifi ed with the totality and the full power of the Word. This explains why her body (in the shape of the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> ) is “made of fifty phonemes,” the Sanskrit alphabet being, as we have seen, the totality of the Word.</p>
<ul>

<p>*Encounter in the * Mantra * *</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>Going upward, from the <em>mūlādhāra</em> , in the body of the adept, the <em>vidyā</em></p>
<p>as <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> pierces three <em>maṇḍalas</em> not otherwise identifi ed by the YH</p>
<p>and its commentary, except (by the Dī ) as being those of the fi re, the sun, and the moon, traditionally considered to have, respectively, ten, twelve, and sixteen divisions called <em>kalās</em> , totaling thus thirty-eight. These <em>kalās</em> are cosmic and divine entities with which are associated the fifty Sanskrit phonemes; here, too, is the totality of the Word. The moon, called <em>soma</em> (the sacred beverage of the Veda), is traditionally associated with the <em>amṛta</em> , the nectar, which, when this center is pierced by the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> , flows over and fi lls up the universe and, evidently, the body and mind of the adept, who is then identifi ed with the divine <em>śakti</em> , saying, “This energy is my own self.”</p>
<p>“The thought [ <em>buddhi</em> ] that ‘this <em>kunḍalinīśakti</em> made of consciousness</p>
<p>[ <em>cinmayī</em> ] is my own self’ [ <em>svātmeti</em> ], that is to say, the total fusion by identifi cation [ *tadātmatayā samāveśa ḥ * ] with this form [of power], such is the sense of the secret meaning,” says the Dī , which also says that <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> , having pierced the moon <em>maṇḍala</em> , enters the <em>akula</em> center. 27</p>
<p>The experience described here is therefore both cosmic and bodily.</p>
<p>The Dī quotes a stanza from the <em>Svacchandasaṁgraha</em> which says that the supreme sky ( <em>paraṁ vyoman</em> ) is placed on the head between the forehead and the summit of the head (between the <em>brumadhya</em> or <em>bindu</em> and the <em>brahmarandhra</em> ).</p>
<p>Then comes the next meaning:</p>
<p>The meaning [relating to] the highest reality, I will tell you, O Goddess.</p>
<p>It [consists in] uniting oneself with the indivisible, supreme, subtle, imperceptible, with no concrete existence, the reality supreme, above the inner sky, light and bliss, both transcending the universe and identical with it. //73–74//</p>
<p><em>mahātattvārtha iti yat tac ca devi vadāmi te</em> /</p>
<p><em>niṣkale parame sūkṣme nirlakṣye bhāvavarjite</em> //73//</p>
<p><em>vyomātīte pare tattve prakāśānandavigrahe</em> /</p>
<p><em>viśvottīrṇe viśvamaye tattve svātmaniyojanam</em> //74//</p>
<p>This stanza heaps up terms to describe the indescribable divine Absolute.</p>
<p>The Dī explains the terms, but the passage does not really need to be interpreted. It underlines the total transcendence of the Absolute, adding,</p>
<p>88
“but this supreme reality is also identical with the universe [ <em>viśvamaya</em> ]”; it manifests itself through the infi nite diversity of the world. Quoting the Upaniṣadic saying <em>tat tvam asi</em> , “This thou art,” 28 the Dī concludes: “Such is the supreme truth. And the meaning relating to the highest reality is to identify oneself totally with it, that is to say, to unite one’s self, whose pure essential nature is awakened by the spiritual master, with the supreme Śiva, giver of the supreme <em>vidyā</em> brimming with this supreme meaning.”</p>
<p>But how are we to know this nature of our self? The answer is:</p>
<p>Since luminosity is the state of things that are luminous and also that of those that are dark, there is therefore a necessary and essential connection between the universe and the [highest reality]. //75//</p>
<p><em>tadā prakāśamānatvaṁ tejasāṁ tamasām api</em> /</p>
<p>*avinābhāvarūpatvaṁ tasmād viśvasya sarvata ḥ * //75//</p>
<p>Commenting on this stanza, the Dī gives a summary of some of</p>
<p>the main tenets of the nondualist Śaiva vision of the deity and the cosmos: “Even as Śiva shines in the mind [ <em>citte</em> ] of all living beings, in the same way the self is united to the senses and these to the objects; thus the state of luminosity exists in luminous things, such as the sun, etc., and also in those that are insentient, dark, such as pots and pans and the like. It shines fi rst in consciousness, in the supreme Śiva, who is the Self of consciousness [ <em>cidātman</em> ], then through the play of sense organs; the perception of reality shines also on the plane of the diversity of objects. As the Revelation says: ‘Everything shines as a refl ection of His Light, by His brightness this [world] shines’ (Katha Upaniṣad, 5.15).”</p>
<p>This vision of the cosmos as something that shines ( <em>prakāśate</em> ) as a refl ection of the divine light (a theme developed notably by Abhinavagupta in the <em>Tantrāloka</em> , chapter 3) is stated again in the next half-stanza: The highest reality shines, O Flame of the essence of the divine play! //76a//</p>
<p><em>prakāśate mahātattvaṁ divyakrīḍārasojjvale</em> /</p>
<p>This play ( <em>krīḍā</em> ) of the Goddess is the unlimited power of divine Consciousness ( <em>cicchakti</em> ), a power whose work is to manifest and animate the universe: “Thou, O Goddess! art the blazing light bursting forth from this action, being [ for us and in us] the intuitive comprehension [ <em>pratīti</em> ] 29</p>
<p>eternally fastened on the total union of Śiva and Śakti.”</p>

<p>The state of mind necessary to have this mystical experience of the highest reality is the complete nakedness, or void, of consciousness, without any will to act or any doubt about what is to be done. Once this state is present, the certainty fl ashes forth that “I am Śiva” ( <em>śivo ‘ham</em> ), says the commentary.</p>
<p>It is seen in the ocean of the high knowledge. There, no doubt [survives], O Pārvatī! //77b// Giver of divine powers, it is present in the</p>

<p>Amṛtānanda explains the term <em>vidyāpītha</em> , saying that the Śrīvidyā is herself the <em>pīṭha</em> , since she is the place where Śiva and śakti rest together.</p>
<p>This seat is made up of the three constitutive parts (the <em>kūṭas</em> or <em>bījas</em> ) of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , whose meaning or spiritual import is to be experimentally realized by following the phonic process that extends from the fi rst syllable of each <em>kūṭa</em> to the ultimate phonic vibration of the *HRĪṂ * that ends each of them: the phonic plane of <em>unmanā</em> , the “transmental.” 30</p>
<p>As for the divine powers ( <em>divyasiddhi</em> ), they are defi ned as consisting of the total knowledge and understanding of the supreme reality, not as the possession of supernatural powers, which is the usual meaning of the term <em>siddhi</em> —a meaning that is, however, given to it in stanzas 203–204 of the last chapter: Amṛtānanda, as we know, interprets the YH according to the Śaiva nondualist tradition, insisting on its metaphysical and spiritual aspects, not the magical ones.</p>
<p>Will enjoy this, O Goddess! those who follow the practice of Kula and who meditate on the feet of the Master, who take part zealously in the meetings with the Yoginīs, who have received the divine unction, are free from the stain of doubt, their spirit ceaselessly joyful</p>

and well versed in the secret meaning known through the uninterrupted succession [of masters]. //78b–80//</p>

<p>“The <em>kaulas</em> ,” says the Dī , “are those who know that <em>kula</em> is the body</p>
<p>and that it can have a very great use.” 31</p>
<p>Concerning the meditation on the feet of the Master, the Dī quotes the following stanza: “One is the shape of Śiva, luminous by himself</p>
<p>[ <em>prakāśa</em> ]. [One, too,] is the ‘being’ or essence [ <em>tanu</em> ] which is its awareness [ <em>vimarśa</em> ]. The supreme, total fusion of these two aspects [of the supreme deity], such is the imprint of the feet [of the Master]. It is in essence the supreme Śiva.” The supreme godhead is, in the nondualist Śaiva traditions, both light ( <em>prakāśa</em> ) and free consciousness ( <em>vimarśa</em> ), a reality that only those who are devoted to the feet of the Master will enjoy.</p>
<p>The “meeting with the Yoginīs” ( <em>yoginīmelana</em> ) is a collective <em>kula</em> ritual in which participants, by pair, male and female, under the guid-ance of their guru, worship the deity, the ritual usually including the sexual union of the participating couples. The Dī underlines the festive, joyful atmosphere of the rite, in which the adepts, fully instructed according to the traditional teaching, free from doubt, enjoy the union with the deity.</p>
<p>[So it is and] not otherwise, I promise you, O Goddess, Beauty of the Family! //80// Those who, deprived of the tradition, are infatuated with their own science, since they transgress the rule, the rays [of consciousness] destroy them. //81//</p>

<p>The infatuated adepts are those who, being without an initiated guru, do not benefi t from the teachings of the Tantras, do not know the meanings expounded here, and therefore do not understand the full meaning and import of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> and of its constituting syllables: the rules of utterance ( <em>uccāra</em> ) of the mantras, and so forth.</p>
<p>The rays of consciousness ( <em>cinmarīci</em> ), the Dī explains, are the Mothers of Kula ( *kulamātara ḥ * ), the goddesses Brahmī, and so on, along with the deities of the bodily elements ( <em>dhātudevatā</em> ) 32 , the Ḍ ākinīs. These divine rays destroy the bodies of the bad adepts by causing a disequilibrium of these elements.</p>
<p>But he who experiences consciously the joy of the divine essence, staggering in the bliss of alcohol, propitiates the rays [of consciousness] at all times and especially in the morning, on lunar days, and on those of the constellation of the deity, obtains the fullness of</p>
<p>[awakened] consciousness. //82–83//</p>

<p>*marīcīn prīṇayaty eva madirānandaghūrṇita ḥ * /</p>
<p><em>sarvadā ca viśeṣeṇa labhate pūrṇabhodhatām</em> //83//</p>
<p>The yogin who follows the practices of Kula ( <em>kaulācāra</em> ) is deemed to be always united with Śiva. His experience is that of “the uncreated fl ashing bliss of the intense absolute consciousness [ <em>parāmarśa</em> ] of his unity with the supreme Śiva.” Then, says the Dī , having partaken of the ritual off erings ( <em>arghya</em> ) to the Goddess (which include meat and alcohol), he staggers.</p>
<p>The particular times and days mentioned here are those when occasional mandatory rituals, prescribed in Tantric manuals of worship, are to be practiced by the adept.</p>
<p>O Mistress of the gods! such a state [of mind] made of highest</p>
<p>knowledge is immediately obtained by human beings thanks to the grace of the best of spiritual masters. //84//</p>
<p>*evaṁbhavas tu deveśi deśikendraprasādata ḥ * /</p>
<p>*mahājñānamayo devi sadya ḥ saṁprāpyate narai ḥ * //84//</p>
<p>The chapter concludes:</p>
<p>92
Thus, the knowledge that gives all this, which is attained through the science of the phonemes of the <em>vidyā</em> , O Goddess! and is secret, has been explained to you in six ways, O Durgī! because of my love</p>
<p>[ for you]. He who understands this becomes immediately lord of the circle of heroes. //85//</p>
<p><em>evam etatpradaṁ jñānaṁ vidyārṇāgamagocaram</em> /</p>
<p><em>devi guhyaṁ priyeṇaiva vyākhyātaṁ durgiṣaḍvidham</em> /</p>
<p><em>sadyo yasya prabodhena vīracakreśvaro bhavet</em> //85//</p>
<p>The lord of the circle of heroes, says the Dī , is the supreme Śiva, which means that the initiated adept who has obtained the knowledge of the six meanings is identifi ed with Śiva.</p>

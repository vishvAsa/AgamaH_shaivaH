  <p>pŪjĀsaṁketa</p>
<p>this chapter is also called <em>saṁketa</em> , since wherever male and female principles or deities are present in couples during the <em>pūjā</em> , Śiva and Śakti can be held to be present in conjunction: they meet and/or fulfi ll their promise ( <em>saṁketa</em> ) to be there. The worship, too, although it is that of Tripurasundarī, is aimed at the supreme godhead, which both includes and transcends the masculine and the feminine. Since the chapter describes ritual practices, the term <em>saṁketa</em> could also be translated as “practice,” which is one of the meanings of this Sanskrit word.</p>
<p>This chapter is the longest. With 204 stanzas, it accounts for more than half of the <em>Yoginīhr̥daya</em> . It does not describe precisely the visible aspect of the Goddess, although she is to be visualized as clearly and precisely as possible during the worship, which is performed on a <em>śrīcakra</em> , without any material icon, the deities to be worshipped being placed immaterially by <em>nyāsa</em> , using their mantras, on the diff erent parts of the <em>cakra</em> , 1 where they are to be visualized and imagined as present. The fact that the YH</p>
<p>consists of instructions given by Bhairava to Tripurasundarī may explain why she is not described. The main reason, however, for the lack of practical informations is that the YH is not a mere ritual manual to be read and used privately by any person. It is a revealed text to be transmitted by word of mouth to a chosen disciple by a master who would give him all necessary information for understanding the doctrine and performing the sometimes very complicated prescribed ritual actions.</p>
<p>The <em>pūjā</em> is to be performed using a <em>śrīcakra</em> diagram, usually drawn ritually and according to precise rules, with colored powders, and adorned as mentioned in stanzas 95b–97. But if this geometrical fi gure is the necessary material basis of the worship of Tripurasundarī, the <em>pūjā</em> , its</p>
<p>94
performance appears (as is, in fact, the case in all Tantric ritual worship) to consist more in evoking mental images and uttering (audibly or mentally) mantras than in concrete visible actions. At some points, the offi ciating</p>
<p>adept is to concentrate intensely and/or follow the ascent of his <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> .</p>
<p>He is therefore intensely and completely implicated, immersed, in what he is doing, The <em>śrīcakrapūjā</em> is (or ought to be) a total—bodily, mental, spiritual—divinizing experience. This aspect appears from the start, in the fi rst stanzas of this chapter, and is continuously underlined by the Dī.</p>
<p>Now, O Incomparable One! I will tell you the practice of the worship whose mere knowledge causes the liberated in life to exult. //1//</p>
<p>Your worship, eternally present and manifest, is threefold, O Gaurī! It is supreme, nonsupreme, and thirdly, supreme-nonsupreme. //2//</p>
<p><em>pūjāsaṁketam adhunā kathayāmi tavānaghe</em> /</p>
<p><em>yasyaprabodhamātreṇa jīvanmukta ḥ pramodate</em> //1//</p>
<p><em>tava nityoditā pūjā tribhir bhedair vyavasthitā</em> /</p>
<p><em>parā cāpy apara gauri tṛtīyā ca parāparā</em> //2//</p>
<p>The Sanskrit term used to characterize the ritual worship of the Goddess is <em>nityodita</em> , which means eternally ( <em>nitya</em> ) appearing or arising ( <em>udita</em> ), being eternally present. The term is often used by Jayaratha in his commentary on the <em>Tantrāloka</em> as the characteristic of the divine Consciousness, which is ever present, active, manifested. It is applied here to the <em>pūjā</em> because the supreme deity is deemed to be ceaselessly worshipped in the heart of her devotees, a worship made in the luminous center of nonduality ( <em>advaya</em> <em>dhāmni</em> ), “in the grandeur of the inner void,” says Amṛtānanda. The nonsupreme worship is the ordinary ritual worship, which will be described in this chapter. The supreme-nonsupreme one consists in “intense meditation [ <em>bhāvanā</em> ], absorption in the absolute Consciousness, in nonduality</p>
<p>and in the nondualistic element present in the dualistic worship.” 2</p>
<p>The main traits of these three types of worship are now shown:</p>
<p>The domain of the fi rst [type of worship] is the activity of all [senses]</p>
<p>insofar as they remain in the condition of nonduality. //3a//</p>
<p><em>prathamādvaitabhāvasthā sarvaprasaragocarā</em> /</p>
<p>This worship is purely spiritual. The Dī quotes here stanzas 116–117 of the <em>Vijñānabhairava</em> , the fi rst of which states: “Wherever the mind goes,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*Encounter in the Worship *</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>toward the exterior or the interior, there is the state of Shiva. Since he is omnipresent, where can [the mind] go to avoid [Him]?” There is no way to evade the omnipresence of the supreme deity.</p>
<p>The second one, the worship of the <em>cakra</em> , is ceaselessly performed by me. //3//</p>
<p><em>dvitiyā cakrapūjā ca sadā niṣpadyate mayā</em> //3//</p>
<p>We may well wonder how Bhairava would ritually worship</p>
<p>Tripurasundarī. He says this, however, in spite of his being omniscient, in order to help the devotees understand nonduality.</p>
<p>The third one, O Goddess! consists in [placing] that which arises by itself in what is pure knowledge. //4a//</p>
<p><em>evaṁ jñānamaye devi tṛtīyā svaprathāmayī</em> /</p>
<p>This practice is “supreme-nonsupreme” ( <em>parāpara</em> ) in that it consists (insofar as we can understand the YH and the Dī ), for the adept, in seeing mentally by an intense meditation of nonduality ( <em>advaitabhāvanā</em> ) all the rites he performs—the worship of all the deities abiding in the <em>śrīcakra</em> , that is <em>—</em> as immersed in the Absolute. The Dī quotes: “With the off ering, I throw the mental constructions of the limited being, and all such elements, into the fi re which is a compact mass of consciousness, just as one pours clarifi ed butter into the sacrifi cial fi re.” We will see later several ritual acts interpreted metaphysically in the same way.</p>
<p>The highest is known as the supreme one. Listen now to how it</p>
<p>must be done. //4//</p>
<p>Having evoked mentally within the <em>vāgbhava</em> placed in the forest of the great lotus the footprint of the [divine] Master which fi lls the form of the universe by pouring down the supreme ambrosia, //5//</p>
<p>[the adept] totters, intoxicated with the realization of nonduality with the supreme.</p>
<p><em>uttamā sā parā jñeyā vidhānaṁ śṛṇu saṁpratam</em> //4//</p>

This practice is considered supreme because it implies a complete fusion of the adept with the Absolute.</p>
<p><em>Vāgbhava</em> , here as in stanza 69 of chapter 2 (see above), designates not the fi rst <em>kūṭ</em> a of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> but the place where the four planes of the Word ( <em>vāc</em> ) are situated ( <em>bhavanti</em> ). This totality of the Word is to be visualized by the adept as shining in the “forest of the great lotus,” that is, the <em>akulapadma</em> , which, as we have seen in chapter 1, is, in this system, a white thousand-petaled lotus located on the summit of the <em>suṣumnā</em> , where the <em>vyāpinīkalā</em> of the <em>uccāra</em> of the mantra is located, pouring incessantly a flow of ambrosia ( <em>amṛta</em> ). The Dī explains that this flow of ambrosia is “the flow of the essence of the undivided divine Consciousness.” The adept is to have an intimate direct awareness ( <em>svātmatayā vimṛśya</em> ) of this. Note that the above visualizations are to be mentally “seen” in the yogic body of the adept; yoga and worship are inseparable.</p>
<p>The footprint of the Master is the presence in this world of the supreme Śiva. Amṛtānanda quotes again the fi rst stanza of his <em>Cidvilāsastava</em> : “One is the form of Śiva, luminous by himself. One [also] is the ‘being’ [ <em>tanu</em> ]</p>
<p>which is the awareness of this. The supreme [reality], total fusion of these two [elements], such is the footprint of [the Master]: it is in essence the supreme Śiva.”</p>
<p>On the realization of nonduality, the Dī adds: “The mystical realization of the absence of all duality with Him consists in being totally absorbed in the [awareness of ] ‘This, verily, I am’ [ <em>saivāham asmīti samāveśa</em> ], a state called intoxication since it makes one [divinely] intoxicated; and it is because of the state thus caused that the [adept], full of joy, totters.”</p>
<p>He must turn away from the chatter of discursive thought, being entirely devoted to the contemplation of the <em>nāda</em> which arises inside the Small One. //6//</p>
<p><em>daharāntarasaṁsarpan nādālokanatatpara ḥ</em> //6//</p>
<p><em>vikalparūpasaṁjalpavimukha ḥ</em></p>
<p>To defi ne the Small One ( <em>dahara</em> ), the Dī quotes the <em>Mahānārāyana</em> <em>Upaniṣad</em> : “The Small One, without defects, residence of the supreme Lord, lotus of the heart abiding in the center of the citadel.” It is therefore the space in the center of the lotus of the heart: “In this Small One is the inner space” ( <em>daharo’sminn artarākāśa ḥ</em> ), says the <em>Chāndogya Upaniṣad</em> .</p>
<p>The adept must therefore contemplate, meditate, this symbol of the supreme, concentrating on the <em>nāda</em> , the inner subtle vibration he feels in</p>

<p>his heart, leaving therefore aside such discursive activity as the recitation of mantras.</p>
<p>The adept must meditate ( <em>dhyānaṁ kuryāt</em> ) as follows: Ceaselessly looking inward, [he participates] in the intense beauty that is the destruction of contraction by the shining forth of the power of consciousness. //7//</p>

<p>The actual, material worship is now described in the 156 stanzas that follow:</p>
<p>The worship of oneself must be done with elements that are pleasing to the senses. //8a//</p>
<p><em>indriyaprīṇanair dravyair vihitasvātmapūjana ḥ</em> /</p>
<p>The worship to be done is not of the self of the worshipper but of the deity that is the very essence <em>—</em> the deity of one’s self ( <em>svātmadevatā</em> ) <em>—</em> of the worshipper. The Dī quotes here a text that says: “To worship in a natural fashion the deity that is one’s own self by using perfumes etc. to which the doors of the senses are opened, such is the great sacrifi ce of one who knows.” And it adds: “as has been said, the highest sort of <em>pūjā</em> consists in attaining a complete fusion [ <em>sāmarasīkaraṇa</em> ] thanks to the great felicity born from the experience of the sounds, etc., perceived by the ears and the other senses of the worshipper.” The identifi cation of the worshipper with the deity being worshipped, which is the aim of the Tantric <em>pūjā</em> , is considered in all Tantras as being more easily achieved when helped by the beauty and charm of the ritual.</p>
<p>The description of the “nonsupreme” ( <em>apara</em> ) <em>pūjā</em> begins now, with the preliminary rite of <em>nyāsa</em> , which is very complex, a large number of elements having to be ritually imposed on the body of the offi</p>
<p>ciant in order to</p>
<p>purify and divinize it: identifying it with the mantra, the <em>śrīcakra</em> , and the deities abiding in it. Seventy-nine stanzas (8–87) are devoted to this rite.</p>
<ul>
<li>Impositions *( nyāsa )</li>
</ul>
<p>Four series of <em>nyāsas</em> are to be performed: fi rst, the “sixfold imposition”( <em>ṣ oḍhānyāsa</em> ), <em>śl.</em> 8–40; second, the imposition of the <em>śrīcakra</em> , <em>śl</em> . 41–68; third,</p>
<p>98
the imposition of the deities abiding in the <em>śrīcakra</em> , <em>śl</em> . 69–79. Then come four series of placings: the purifi cation of the hands ( <em>karaśuddhi</em> ), an imposition of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , then another <em>karaśuddhi</em> , and fi nally a group of impositions of the throne ( <em>āsana</em> ) and of several entities. Finally this is completed ( <em>śl</em> . 85–86) by a <em>tritattvanyāsa</em> on the whole body deemed to achieve the total</p>
<p>“cosmicization” and divinization of the offi</p>
<p>ciating <em>sādhaka</em> . 3</p>
<p>One must [fi rst] perform the placing of mantras on the body starting with the sixfold placing. //8//</p>
<p><em>nyāsaṁ nirvartayed deheṣoḍhānyāsapura ḥ saram</em> //8//</p>
<p>The fi rst placing [must be done] with the Gaṇeśas, the second one with the planets, the third with the <em>nakṣatras</em> , the fourth with the Yoginīs, //9// the fi fth with the signs of the zodiac, and the sixth with the <em>pīṭhas.</em> The sixfold <em>nyāsa</em> [now] told to you is said everywhere to be invincible. //10// The one whose body is touched in this way is worthy of being worshipped by all yogins. In the worlds there is no [being, even his] father, mother, etc., that he should revere. //11//</p>
<p>He alone is to be venerated by all [ for] he is himself the supreme Lord. If he were to bow in front of someone who has not received the sixfold <em>nyāsa</em> , O Parvatī! //12// he would soon die and go to hell.</p>

<p>worship is a necessity, for it is only after having shed his human ordinary condition and becoming divine that an adept is permitted to approach a deity and to perform its ritual worship, the <em>pūjā</em> . As the saying goes, “One should worship God [after] having become god” ( *devaṁ bhutva devaṁ *</p>
<p><em>yajet</em> ). This is the paradox of the Tantric <em>pūjā</em> that it aims at the divinization of an offi</p>
<p>ciating person who, to be permitted to reach this goal, must</p>
<p>fi rst be already divinized. The paradox <em>—</em> the ritual redundancy <em>—</em> is all the greater since, as we shall see, the <em>ṣ odhānyāsa</em> is followed by other impositions: those of the <em>śrīcakra</em> and of the deities that abide in it.</p>

<p>That there could be fifty-one Gaṇeśas should not surprise the reader.</p>
<p>Tantric deities tend to multiply: there are nine Durgās, sixteen Nityās, eighteen (or fifty-one) Rudras, even six hundred forty million Yoginīs ( <em>śl</em> .</p>
<p>193); the supreme deity manifests thus the omnipresence of its power.</p>
<p>Since there are fifty-one Gaṇeśas, to be placed by <em>nyāsa</em> on the same places as the phonemes of the <em>mātṛkā</em> , the latter must be made up of fifty-one letters, including therefore the so-called Vedic *ḷ *, which is not usual.</p>
<p>Being Tantric, these Gaṇeśas are accompanied by their consorts, fifty-one <em>śaktis</em> , enumerated in the Dī. In iconography, they are shown sitting on the Gaṇeśas’ left thighs, sometimes holding his erect <em>liṅga</em> . The adept, when performing their <em>nyāsa</em> , is probably supposed to visualize these couples as he utters or evokes mentally the mantra of each of these gods. The names of the Gaṇeśas and of their <em>śaktis</em> are not exactly the same in all Tantras.</p>
<p>The <em>nyāsa</em> of other deities or entities is then described, starting with the planets ( <em>graha</em> ): 4</p>
<p>One must impose Sūrya below the heart accompanied by the vowels,</p>
<p>//21// the Producer of Nectar on the place of the <em>bindu</em> with the four phonemes <em>YA</em> , etc.; on the eyes, the Son of the Earth presiding over the group of the gutturals, O Dear One! //22// Then, on the heart, one must place Venus, regent of the group of palatals; above the heart one will impose Mercury, regent of the cerebrals. //23// On the region of the throat, Bṛhaspati, who presides over the dentals, O</p>
<p>Dear One. On the navel, Saturn, master of the <em>pavarga</em> , O Mistress of the Gods! //24// Then one must impose Rahu accompanied by</p>
<p>the four phonemes <em>ŚA</em> , etc., on the face, and Ketu accompanied by the letter <em>KṣA</em> on the anus, O Mistress of the Gods! //25//</p>

<p>The constellations ( <em>nakṣatra</em> ) are then to be imposed: Then, on the forehead, the right and left eye, the two ears, the lobes of the nose, the throat, the shoulders, //26// then on the elbows and on the wrists, on the nipples and on the area of the navel, on the hips and lastly //27// on the thighs and the knees, the ankles and the feet [are to be placed the <em>nakṣatras</em> ] Aśvinīand the others who shine like the blazing fi re [destroyer] of time, their hands making the gesture of granting of wishes and of reassurance //28//</p>
<p>and that of salutation and who are wearing all the ornaments. One must impose them on those places, O Goddess honored by the</p>

<p>The Yoginīs are then to be placed:</p>
<p>One must impose the deities Ḍ ā, etc., mistresses of the constituent elements of the body, on the <em>viṣuddha</em> , heart, navel, <em>svādhisthāna</em> , <em>mūl</em> [ <em>ādhāra</em> ], and <em>ājñā</em> [ <em>cakras</em> ]. //30// They are to be visualized exactly through meditation on the feet and on the <em>liṅga</em> and the</p>

<p><em>pāde liṅge ca kukṣau ca hṛdaye bāhumūlayo ḥ</em> //31//</p>
<p>The “deities Ḍ ā, etc.” are a group of secondary goddesses, or Yoginīs, the name of the fi rst one beginning with <em>ḍa</em> . They are: Ḍ ākinī, Rākinī, Lākinī, Kākinī, Sākinī, and Hākinī. They are traditionally considered the regents of the <em>dhātus</em> , the seven constituent elements of the body, of which the commentary here quotes only six: skin, blood, fl esh, fat, marrow, and</p>
<p>semen, 6 because the YH associates them with six bodily <em>cakras</em> only.</p>
<p>Amṛtā is the fi rst of a group of sixteen <em>śaktis</em> or Mothers ( <em>mātṛkās</em> ); their names are enumerated in a passage of the <em>Svacchandasaṅgraha</em> quoted in the Dī (p. 238).</p>
<p>All these deities are placed mentally on the imaginal body of the offi ciating adept by an <em>āntaranyāsa</em> , an inner imposition, which is a mental rite; this is explained in the commentary, which also says that the <em>dhyāna</em> , the mental visualization of all the deities, can be found “in another <em>āgama</em> .”</p>
<p>Starting with the right foot and ending with the left foot, one must impose the signs of the zodiac, Aries, etc., with the phonemes [of the <em>mātṛkā</em> ], O Parvatī! //32//</p>
<p><em>dakṣiṇaṁ padam ārabhya vāmapādāvasānakam</em> /</p>
<p><em>meṣādi rāśayo varṇair nyastavyā saha pārvati</em> //32//</p>
<p>For this <em>nyāsa</em> , the fifty phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet are distributed in twelve groups, beginning with the group of the vowels and ending with <em>KṣA.</em></p>
<p>Finally to be placed on the body of the offi</p>
<p>ciant are the fifty seats of</p>
<p>power ( <em>pīṭha</em> ) of the Goddess, that is, the fifty places on the Indian subcontinent to which the pieces of the dismembered body of Śiva’s wife, Satī, fell from his shoulders while he roamed, desperate, after her death when she had jumped into the sacrifi cial fi re of Dakṣa: 7</p>
<p>Then, O Goddess, one must impose the <em>pīṭhas</em> on the places where the <em>mātṛkanyāsa</em> [is made]. Their names are [now] given. Listen carefully, O Dear One! //33//:</p>

<p>We have seen in chapter 1 ( <em>śl</em> . 41–43) the four main <em>pīthas</em> of the Tripurā</p>
<p>tradition. Enumerated here are the fifty <em>śākta</em> ones, the list of which varies according to diff erent texts. The list given here is perhaps ancient, but this is not certain. Some <em>pīṭhas</em> can be identifi ed (Kāmarūpa, Nepal, and Varaṇasi, for instance), others not. Attempts have been more or less convincingly made at locating all of them geographically. They seem to spread out all over India but not to include Kashmir.</p>
<p>104
The Dī explains that each phoneme is to be uttered distinctly when placing it on the body, together with the name of the <em>pīṭha</em> concerned. 8</p>
<p>The sixfold [ <em>nyāsa</em> ] having thus been done, the imposition of the <em>śrīcakra</em> is then to be performed. Listen, O Dear One! to the imposition of the <em>cakra</em> of the venerable Tripurasundarī//41// which has never been told to anyone, purifi es the body, and is supreme.</p>
<p><em>evaṁṣodhā purā kṛtvā śrīcakrancakrayāsam ācaret</em> /</p>
<p><em>śrīmattripurasundaryās cakranyāsaṁ śṛṇu priye</em> //41//</p>
<p><em>yan na kaścid ākhyātaṁ tanuśuddhikaraṁ param</em> /</p>
<p>The Dī here extols the <em>nyāsa</em> of the <em>cakra</em> of the supreme goddess Tripurasundarī, who is “the supreme dynamism of consciousness ( <em>paracitkalā</em> ), the object of supreme love ( <em>parapremāspada</em> ), her <em>cakra</em> being made up of all the <em>tattvas</em> from Śiva down to the earth, which is the place where she reveals herself. The process of this <em>nyāsa</em> is to be kept secret.</p>
<p>It purifi es the body and is supreme.” This, says the Dī , is to say that “it transforms the body made of the thirty-six <em>tattvas</em> by bringing it up to the level of the supreme essence”; this is why this imposition is superior to all others.</p>
<p>First, while saying “Praise to the fi rst line of the square,” one must make a pervasive imposition on the right side: on the back of the shoulder, the extremity of the hand, the hip, and the toes and, on the left side: on the toes, the hip, the extremity of the hand, and the back of the shoulder //43// and also on the base and the back of the head, O Beautiful One!</p>

<p>The imposition to be made here is called a <em>vyāpakanyāsa</em> , a term we translate as “pervasive” imposition or placing. This practice, very often prescribed, consists of touching the body on several places according to the usual rules of <em>nyāsa</em> , the eff ect of these several placings being conceived as spreading from one point to the other in order to (in the present</p>

<p>case) trace on the body the lines of the <em>śrīcakra</em> . A <em>vyāpakanyāsa</em> may also be made with the two hands, which rub or stroke the body to pervade it with the power of a mantra.</p>
<p>One may well wonder how a square structure with circles inside it can, even in imagination, actually be placed on a human body. The idea, however, is not so much to place a structure on the body of the adept as to place there all the deities abiding in the <em>śrīcakra</em> , thus pervading him with the divine elements, which are in, and constitute, this diagrammatic supremely energetic form of the supreme Goddess.</p>
<p>On the same ten locations, one must impose the ten Siddhis, Aṇimā,</p>
<p>and the others. 9 //44// Then, back from these, one is to impose [the second line of the square, conceived] as stretching along the body, with the mantra “Praise to the middle line of the square,” O Dear One! as well as the energies Brahmāṇī , etc., on eight locations of this line: on the big toes of the feet, on the right side, then on the other side of the head, //46// on the left and right knees, then on the outsides of the two shoulders.</p>
<p>What is to be imposed [next] must be placed with [the mantra]</p>
<p>“Praise be to the inside line of the square” //47// as stretching</p>
<p>along 10 the body behind the points just described.</p>
<p>On ten points of this [line], one will impose the ten Mudrās. //48//</p>

The Mudrās are the deity aspects of the ten <em>mudrās</em> we have seen in chapter 1, <em>śl</em> . 56–71, which are hand gestures but are also forms of divine power and deities.</p>
<p>The <em>dvādaśānta</em> , the “end of twelve,” is the <em>cakra</em> considered to be located over the head twelve fi nger-breadths above the <em>brahmarandhra</em> . It is the highest of the <em>cakras</em> . The <em>Svacchandasamgraha</em> identifi es it with the sky of consciousness, the <em>vyoman</em> . 11</p>
<p>Then is told the <em>vyāpakanyāsa</em> of the sixteen-petaled lotus: Inside this [square], after having imposed the mantra “Praise to the sixteen-petaled lotus,” one must impose on these petals Kāmākarṣinī</p>
<p>and the other [powers]. //50// The petals are considered as being, on the right side, on the back of the ear, on the shoulder, the elbow, the back of the hand, the thigh, the knee, the ankle, and the sole of the foot, //51// and, on the left side, on the symmetrical [spots], but starting from the sole of the left foot.</p>

<p>Now, the <em>vyāpakanyā</em> of the eight-petaled lotus:</p>
<p>Thereafter, on this [lotus], after having made an imposition using the mantra “Praise to the eight-petaled lotus,” //52// one must place the eight energies Anaṅgakusumā, etc., on these petals, on the right temple, collarbone, thigh, and ankle and on the left ankle, thigh, collarbone, and temple. //53–54a//</p>

<p>The commentary gives the names of these eight minor goddesses,</p>

<p>The preceding ones, Kāmākarṣinī, and so on, to be placed with the imposition of the sixteen-petaled lotus, are Guptayoginīs, “secret Yoginīs”(ritual described in <em>śl</em> . 120–130).</p>
<p>Then follow ( <em>śl</em> . 54–80) the impositions (all of which are pervasive, <em>vyāpakanyāsa</em> ) of the circles of triangles that are inside the lotuses and surround the Goddess; the deities abiding in theses <em>cakras</em> are also placed on the body of the offi</p>
<p>ciant:</p>
<p>Having made an imposition inside this [lotus] with [the mantra]</p>
<p>“Praise to the <em>cakra</em> with fourteen [tri]angles,” //54// one must impose on these [tri]angles the fourteen energies Sarvasaṁkṣobhinī, 12 etc.</p>
<p>These [tri]angles, I will tell you [where to impose them]. //55// [They are to be imposed] on the right side of the forehead, on the middle of the right cheek and of the shoulder, on the [right] side, on the inside of the right thigh and the right leg.

<p>After this, one must also [make an imposition with the mantra]</p>
<p>“Praise to the <em>cakra</em> with ten [tri]angles,” O Pārvati!</p>
<p>The [tri]angles [of this <em>cakra</em> are to be placed] on the right eye, at the root of the nose and on the left eye, on the northeast and the northwest angles of the trunk, the knees, and the anus, then on the angles of the trunk named <em>nairṛti</em> and <em>vahni</em> . //58–59a//</p>

Even for a reader able to follow the Sanskrit text, the two last stanzas are not very clear. The commentary explains, therefore, that the constituent triangles of this <em>cakra</em> are to be mentally visualized ( <em>bhāvanīyāni</em> ). The term <em>kukṣi</em> , which we translate as “trunk,” means usually the belly, but it is explained by the commentary to mean “the part of the body which extends from the thighs to the arms,” that is, the trunk. The upper portion of the trunk is considered to be on the east side, the lower part on the west, the left and right sides respectively on the south and the north. The “angles”</p>
<p>of the trunk would then be where the arms and the thighs begin. “Thus,”</p>
<p>the Dī concludes, “the root of the left arm will be in the northeastern angle</p>
<p>[ <em>ī śa</em> ], the left groin will be in the northwest [ <em>vāyu</em> ], the right groin in the southwest [ <em>nirṛti</em> ], and the root of the right arm in the southeastern 13 angle.”</p>
<p>Then he shall impose //59// the ten energies Sarvasiddhipradā,</p>
<p>etc., O Dear one!</p>
<p>Then, having made the imposition with [the mantra] “Praise to the fi rst <em>cakra</em> with ten [tri]angles” in that [inner <em>cakra</em> of ten angles],</p>
<p>//60// one is to place Sarvajñā, etc., on its angles. [These are to be placed] on the right nostril, the right corner of the mouth, the right breast, the [right] testicle, the scrotum, the left testicle, the left breast, the corner of the mouth and nostril, and the tip of the nose.</p>
<p>Such are, one should know, the ten [tri]angles. //62//</p>

<p>Now is described the pervasive imposition of the eight-triangle <em>cakra</em> : Having imposed inside that one [the mantra] “Praise to the originating <em>cakra</em> with eight [tri]angles,” one must impose on its angles the eight energies Vaśinī, etc. //63//</p>

<p>We may take the Vāgdevīs mentioned here to be the eight Mātṛkās, regents of the <em>vargas</em> of the alphabet.</p>
<p>The chin, the throat, the heart, and the navel are considered as forming the right side [of this <em>cakra</em> ]; the <em>maṇipūra</em> , etc., being the foursome of the left side, //64// the whole forming the [ <em>cakra</em> ] with eight [tri]angles.</p>
<p><em>cibukaṁ kaṇṭhahr̥dayanābhīnāṁ caiva dakṣiṇam</em> /</p>
<p><em>jñeyaṁ pārśvacatuṣkaṁ ca maṇipūrādi vāmakam</em> //64//</p>
<p><em>catuṣṭayaṁ ca pārśvānāṁ etat koṇāṣṭakaṁ puna ḥ</em> /</p>
<p>The <em>cakra</em> of eight triangles is considered “originating” because the three larger <em>cakras</em> encircling it, which we have just seen, are deemed to issue from it. This is consistent with the inner movement of the <em>śrīcakra</em> , which goes from the center to the periphery. The central position of this <em>cakra</em> , encircling the central triangle within which is the <em>bindu—</em> the place of the Goddess <em>—</em> is underlined by the fact that it is imposed on four places along the axis of the body, one of which is not a part of the physical body but is the <em>maṇipūracakra</em> , a center of the yogic imaginal body 14 situated on the level of the navel (as the Dī explains). The weapons ( <em>āyudha</em> ) 15 that the Goddess holds in her four hands are then to be imposed:</p>
<p>One must impose on the outside, in the four directions, around</p>
<p>[this] triangle which is in the heart, the arrows, the bow, the noose, and the goad. //65//</p>
<p><em>hr̥dayasthatrikoṇasya caturdikṣu bahir nyaset</em> //65//</p>
<p><em>śaracāpau pāśasṛṇi</em></p>
<p>Then, having done the imposition with the mantra “Praise to the triangle,” one must impose on the angles [of this triangle], in front, to the right and to the left, //66// the Goddesses Kāmeśvarī, etc., and, in the middle, the Goddess.</p>
<p><em>trikoṇāya namas tathā</em> /</p>
<p><em>vinyasya tasya koṇeṣu agradakṣottareṣu ca</em> //66//</p>
<p><em>kāmeśvarādidevīnāṁ madhye devīṁ ca vinyaset</em> /</p>
<p>The central triangle of the <em>śrīcakra</em> being, as it were, its heart is, quite naturally, to be imposed on the heart of the offi</p>
<p>ciating adept <em>—</em> the heart</p>
<p>110
being, as is well known, the spiritual, mystical center of the human being.</p>
<p>The lines of this triangle (to be placed by a <em>vvāpakanyāsa</em> , whose effi cacy</p>
<p>spreads along all of the outside lines) are to be imposed with the mantra <em>trikoṇāya nama ḥ</em> . To avoid any misunderstanding, the Dī explains that the heart is “in the middle of his breast.” Three goddesses are to be imposed there—Kāmeśvarī, Vajreśvarī, and Bhagamālinī—on the three points of the triangle and, on its center, on the <em>bindu</em> (also called <em>baindavacakra</em> ), the Goddess. The weapons, it is explained, are those of Kāmeśvara and Kāmeśvarī, 16 two diff erent deities that are the male and female aspect of the Goddess; eight <em>āyudhas</em> are thus to be placed.</p>
<p>Thus, O Goddess! I have told you the imposition, a most secret procedure. //67// It is indeed to be performed by you most secretly, O Praised by the heroes! It is to be entrusted to those [only] who follow the rule [of Kula], never to anyone who is not the [initiated]</p>
<p>disciple [of a master of this tradition]. //68//</p>
<p>This [ritual] is more secret than any secret I have revealed to you today.</p>
<p><em>evaṁ mayodito devi nyāso guhyatamakrama ḥ</em> //67//</p>

<p><em>guptād guptataraṁ caitat tavā ‘dya praka ṭīkṛtaṁ</em> /</p>
<p>The extreme importance given to secrecy is, as we have already said, a characteristic Tantric trait. Amṛtānanda gives here a metaphysical reason for this secrecy. He says, speaking for Śiva: “All this I have revealed to you because you are my beloved, your nature being that of the light of consciousness which is a portion of myself” ( <em>madaṁśabhūtavimarśātmikā</em> ). The supreme godhead is indeed <em>prakāśavimarśamāya</em> , both conscious light and absolute Consciousness, a supreme truth not to be revealed to unbelievers.</p>
<p>After this, one must do an imposition beginning with the originating Goddess and ending with Aṇimā. //69//</p>
<p><em>mūlādevyādikaṁ nyāsam aṇimāntaṁ punar nyaset</em> //69//</p>
<p>After having described the placing of the circles of deities abiding in the <em>śrīcakra</em> , going from Aṇimā to the Goddess (called here <em>mūladevī</em> ,</p>
<p>“root-goddess,” since she is the originating cause of the whole universe), 17</p>

<p>the YH now prescribes the imposition of the same deities in the reverse order, from the Goddess to Aṇimā. This is to be done as follows: On the triangle of the head, one must impose, starting from the east [the goddesses] Kāmeśvarī, etc.</p>
<p>One must impose—on the right and on the left—the arrows on the</p>
<p>eyes, the two bows on the eyebrows, //70// the nooses on the ears, the goads on the tip of the nose.</p>
<p><em>śirastrikoṇe pūrvādi kāmeśvaryādikā nyaset</em> /</p>
<p><em>bāṇān netre bruvoś cāpau karṇe pāśadvayaṁ nyaset</em> //70//</p>
<p><em>sṛṇidvayam ca nāṣāgre dakṣiṇāgraṁ tu vinyaset</em> /</p>
<p>The “triangle of the head” is probably the place of the fontanel. The Dī</p>
<p>describes it: “there is on the center of the head a triangular place, which is easily seen, being very fragile, on small children.” The deities accompanying Kāmeśvarīare Vajreśvarīand Bhagamālinī. The offi</p>
<p>ciant is to imagine</p>
<p>on the top of his head a triangular place where he imposes the Goddess surrounded by her three fi rst <em>āvaraṇadevatās</em> . 18 The “weapons” ( <em>āyudha</em> ) to be imposed on the left and the right of this triangle are those held by Kāmeśvara (on the right) and Kāmeśvarī(on the left).</p>
<p>Along a rosary placed on the head, one must impose the eight</p>
<p>Vāgdevatas. //71//</p>
<p><em>muṇḍamālākrameṇaiva nyased vāgdevatāṣṭakam</em> //71//</p>
<p>These eight deities of the word, also named Mātrya</p>
<p>ṣṭaka, or</p>
<p>Aṣṭamātarā ḥ , “the eight Mothers,” presiding over the eight groups ( <em>varga</em> ) of phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet are usually Mahālakṣmī(or Brahmī), 19 and so on. The Dī says they are “Vaśinī, etc.,” a list proper to the Śrīvidyā, however, not given. They are also considered to form a group of eight <em>siddhayoginī</em> , as we will see later (3.154).</p>
<p>The <em>cakra</em> of the <em>bindu</em> and the other ones are [the only elements now] to be imposed, O Beautiful One! on the inside and outside</p>
<p>corners of the eye, then in front and in the back of the ear. //72//</p>
<p>In front of the tuft 20 one must impose the half [of these deities], the</p>
<p>other half being imposed on the tuft behind the ear, in front of the ear, and on the inner and outside corners of the eye. //73//</p>

<p>The deities of the retinue of the Goddess, surrounding her, are now to be imposed on the body of the offi</p>
<p>ciant:</p>
<p>One must then impose the [Yoginīs] Sarvasiddhi[pradā], etc., on the neck, going from the right to the left. Then on the heart, in the same way, the energies abiding in the <em>cakra</em> of fourteen triangles. //74//</p>
<p>The lotus with eight petals is to be imposed on the navel; this, however, is made on the spine, on the left, then on the other side of the belly, this for the fi rst group of four [ <em>śaktis</em> ]. //75// The other group of four [ <em>śaktis</em> ] is imposed between the spine and the left side, etc.</p>

<p><em>vaṁśavāmāntarālādi nyased anyaccatuṣṭayam</em> /</p>
<p>The exact places on the body on which to impose all these deities are explained in the commentary. For instance, “in front of the tuft” is explained as the forehead. Since our readers are not expected to practice this <em>pūjā</em> , we do not believe it is necessary to clarify the text.</p>
<p>The two next impositions are to be made on two <em>cakras</em> ; they are to be imposed by <em>nyāsa</em> on the parts of the body corresponding to the <em>cakras</em> . For the <em>svādhiṣṭhāna</em> , the group of four deities is to be placed circularly on four places on the lower part of the belly. As for the ten Mudrās to be imposed on the <em>mūlādhāra</em> , they are, in fact, to be imposed there and (according to the Dī ) on the right and the left of the spine:</p>
<p>On the <em>svādhiṣṭhāna</em> one must impose, starting from the east in front of oneself and fi nishing in the south, //76// the [energies] in groups of four, successively, in the four directions of space.</p>
<p>The best of <em>sādhakas</em> must impose the ten Mudrās on the <em>mūlādhāra</em> .</p>

<p>[The locations] above and below being excluded, //78// one will impose the eight [energies, or Mothers] Brahmaṇī , etc., on the right leg, this being done as [was described] previously.

<p>“Brahmanī, etc.,” are the eight Mothers ( <em>mātṛkā</em> ) who preside over the eight groups of phonemes ( <em>varga</em> ) of the Sanskrit alphabet. They are called Vāgdevatā, “Goddesses of the Word” ( <em>śl.</em> 71), and Vāgdevīs ( <em>śl</em> . 84).</p>
<p>The ten Siddhis, which are deities or Yoginīs <em>and</em> supernatural human powers, have already been mentioned above ( <em>śl</em> . 44).</p>
<p>The YH now concludes on the nature and role of <em>nyāsa</em> : The imposition spreads from its cause as a lamp, it is said, [is lighted] from [another] lamp. //80// [Thus,] who has performed the imposition in this way, O Mistress of the Gods! will consider himself as not diff erent from the Self.</p>

<p><em>evaṁ vinyasya deveśi svābhedena vicintayet</em> /</p>
<p>114
As the Dī explains, this stanza is to be understood metaphysically.</p>
<p>What is the “cause,” or, better, what is at the root of the imposition of the <em>śricakra</em> (together with the Goddess and the deities abiding in it), is the total fusion of the light and the act of consciousness ( <em>prakā</em></p>
<p><em>śvimarśasāmarasya</em> ): 21 the supreme deity insofar as it is identical with the totality of the universe ( <em>akhilajagadrūpa</em> ), which, as we have seen, is the real nature of the <em>śrīcakra</em> . By imposing on the body of the offi ciant, section by section <em>—</em> as lamps are lighted going from one lamp to another <em>—</em> all the constitutive parts and all the deities of the <em>śrīcakra</em> , the adept’s body becomes progressively, part after part, identifi ed with this cosmic Absolute in its several aspects and in its totality. To quote the Dī : “Having meditated and made mentally appear [ <em>vibhāvya</em> ] all the parts of the <em>śrīcakra</em> together with their energies as not diff erent from the various parts of his body [on which they are imposed, the adept]</p>
<p>must meditate and realize mystically [ <em>bhāvayet</em> ] that there is no distinction between himself and the supreme [Goddess] presiding over this</p>
<p>[ <em>cakra</em> ].”</p>
<p>This identifi cation once obtained, the adept must still perform a few other preliminary rites:</p>
<p>Then [the offi</p>
<p>ciant] must do the impositions of purifi cation of</p>
<p>the hands, etc., his mind being fully concentrated. //81// He</p>
<p>must impose the <em>vidyā</em> on the head, the sex organs, and the heart, on the three eyes, on the ears, O Goddess! then on the</p>
<p>mouth and on the arms, //82// on the back, on the knees, and</p>
<p>on the navel. After this, he must perform the purifi cation of the hands, then impose the throne, the six <em>aṅgas</em> //83//, Śrīkaṇṭha, etc., and the Vāgdevīs. Then he must impose the <em>cakras</em> of fi re, etc., on the [ <em>mul</em> ] <em>ādhāra</em> , the heart, the tuft, and on the place of the <em>bindu</em> . //84//</p>

<p>The imposition of the <em>vidyā</em> is that of the three <em>bījas</em> (or <em>kūṭas</em> ) of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , the <em>vāgbhavabīja</em> being imposed on the head, the <em>kāmarājabīja</em> on the sexual organs, and the <em>śaktibīja</em> on the heart.</p>
<p>The Dī does not identify the throne. The six <em>aṅga</em> are the six “limbs” of Śiva: <em>hrdaya</em> (heart), <em>śiras</em> (head), <em>śikha</em> (tuft), <em>kavaca</em> (cuirass), <em>netra</em> (eyes), and <em>astra</em> (weapon), which are, in fact, not limbs of the body but attributes or powers of the god (or of any other deity). The <em>nyāsa</em> of Śrīkaṇṭha is an imposition of fifty Rudras, of which Śrīkaṇṭha is the fi rst. The eight Vāgdevīs, as we have seen, are the Mātṛkās, Kāmeśvarī, and so on, mistresses of the <em>vargas</em> of the Sanskrit alphabet.</p>
<p>The imposition of “the <em>cakras</em> of fi re, etc.” is a complex procedure. First to be imposed are the <em>cakras</em> of the three luminaries ( <em>dhāman</em> ), Fire, Moon, and Sun; then the four main <em>pīṭhas</em> of the Śrīvidyā, Oḍḍiyāna, Kāmarūpa, Jālandhara, and Pūrṇagiri, with their regents, powers, and attendant goddesses. The details of this process are given in the Dī.</p>
<p>Then a last imposition is to be made:</p>
<p>Having made a general imposition of the three <em>tattvas</em> [separately] and together, accompanied by the three <em>bījas</em> of the <em>vidyā</em> , from the feet to the navel, the neck, and the head, //85// then having identifi ed himself with the Supreme, [the offi</p>
<p>ciant of the rite] must off er to the Goddess a</p>
<p>libation whose liquids are the nectars of moon and fi re. //86//</p>
<p><em>tattvatrayaṁ samastaṁ ca vidyābījatrayānvitam</em> /</p>
<p><em>pādādinābhiparyantam āgalaṁ śirasas tathā</em> //85//</p>
<p><em>vyāpakaṁ caiva vinyasya svātmīkṛtya paraṁ puna ḥ</em> /</p>
<p><em>saṁtarpayet punar devīṁ saumyāgneyāmṛtadravai ḥ</em> //86//</p>
<p>The three <em>tattvas</em> ( <em>tritattva</em> ) are Śiva, <em>śakti,</em> and <em>nara</em> (God, the energy, and man), the three components of the cosmos, each being imposed while uttering one of the three parts of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , the cosmic divine totality being thus imposed on the adept before he begins the ritual of the <em>pūjā.</em></p>
<p>According to the Dī , the moon is the “half- <em>kalā</em> of <em>HA</em> without second” ( <em>anuttara</em> ), that is, <em>Ḥ</em> , which is in the triangle at the center of the thousand-petaled lotus placed at the base of the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> , whereas the fi re is the letter <em>S</em> in the triangle at the center of the four-petaled lotus of the <em>mūlādhāra</em> . (The mantra to be imposed is therefore <em>SAU Ḥ</em> , the <em>bījamantrra</em> of Paṛā, the supreme goddess of the Trika.) From there, a flow of nectar</p>
<p>116
issues, resulting from the fusion of the <em>amṛtakuṇḍalinī</em> of moon and the <em>agnikuṇḍalinī</em> of fi re, one flowing downward and the other upward, assuming the double (sexual) aspect of the union of <em>yoni</em> and <em>liṅga.</em></p>
<p>It is thus, O Worshipped by the Gods! that the fourfold imposition is to be performed. The sixfold <em>nyāsa</em> , O Dear One! that of Animā, etc., and that of the <em>mūladevī</em> , and so forth, //87// and also that of the purifi cation of the hands [must be performed completely] by the adept in order to completely eff ect his object.</p>

<p><em>ṣ oḍhanyāso ‘ṇimādyaś ca mūladevyādika ḥ priye</em> //87//</p>
<p><em>karaśuddhyādikaś caiva sādhakena susiddhaye</em> /</p>
<p>This object, says the Dī , is liberation, not the possession of supernatural powers, since these are already possessed by the adept who is a <em>sādhaka</em> .</p>
<p>They are to be performed each separately in the morning, at the time of the ritual worship, during the rite of <em>homa</em> //88/ and the <em>japa</em> ; or the best of adepts will do all of them during worship.</p>

<p>The commentary explains that the sixfold <em>nyāsa</em> is to be done in the morning, at the time of the worship, the <em>nyāsa</em> of the Siddhis, Animā, and so on; the imposition of the Goddess, and so on, taking place with the <em>homa</em> and the <em>karaśuddhinyāsa</em> , and so on, having to be performed when doing <em>japa</em> . Otherwise, all the impositions can be performed before beginning the <em>pūjā</em> , as prescribed here.</p>

<p>The Goddess dominates the universe; her throne is therefore made up of all the <em>tattvas</em> that constitute it, from the <em>tattva</em> of earth to that of Śiva.</p>
<p>One would be tempted to imagine this throne as rising up from the central <em>bindu</em> of the <em>śrīcakra</em> . The commentary, however, says that it is the whole <em>śrīcakra</em> that is to be imagined as the throne of the Goddess, “because it is the receptacle of the rays of light of consciousness [ <em>cinmarīci</em> ], 23 of the deities, that is, who abide in the <em>śrīcakra</em> .” Regarding the mantra and the ritual action to be performed, a stanza is quoted as stating: “One must, while meditating in one’s heart the <em>tattvas</em> from earth to Śiva, cause the throne to appear by throwing lotuses on which the phoneme <em>SAU</em> 24 has been recited.” (How and on what the lotuses are to be thrown is not said.) The “secret Yogin</p>
<p>ī s” (</p>
<p><em>guptayoginī</em>), says the D</p>
<p>ī , are not hidden</p>
<p>but are all those that are manifested ( <em>prakaṭa</em> ). The other ones form seven groups: Guptatara (very secret), Sampradaya (traditional), Kulakaula, Nigarbha, Rahasya (hidden), Atirahasya (very hidden), and Parāpararahasya. This makes eight groups in all, which are to be found, under the same or under diff erent names, in many Tantric Śaiva traditions. We shall meet these Yoginīs later, in <em>śl</em> . 113–155 of this chapter, distributed in the diff erent parts of the <em>śrīcakra</em> , from the outer square to the central triangle</p>
<p>The Dī adds that since the adept must fi rst perform an inner, purely mental worship, he must meditate on the <em>śrīcakra</em> “made of all the <em>tattvas</em> ” as being his own body and perform a worship on his head with the <em>mūlamantra</em> of the Yoginis.</p>
<p>He will then proceed by removing the internal obstacles:</p>
<p>Since they are shared out among the [centers named] <em>piṇḍa</em> , <em>rūpa</em> , <em>pada</em> , and <em>granthi</em> , the [internal] obstacles [are destroyed] by the imposition of the <em>vidyā</em>  on the secret place, 25 the heart, the face, and</p>
<p>the head, O Beautiful One! //91//</p>
<p><em>piṇḍarūpapadagranthibhedanād vighnabhedanam</em> /</p>
<p><em>guhyahṛṇmukhamūrdhasu vidyānyāsena sundari</em> //91//</p>
<p><em>Pinda</em> , <em>rūpa</em> , <em>pada</em> , and <em>granthi</em> are places or elements of the structure of the yogic body that are also bodily centers of focused awareness, normally tiered along the <em>suṣumnā</em> . As such, they represent stages of (bodily) experience in the ascending movement toward liberation. They are proper to the Kula traditions, notably the Kubjikāmata. The internal obstacles to be destroyed are</p>
<p>118
mental or sensual dispositions that tend to block the way toward liberation and, in the present case, to prevent the offi</p>
<p>ciant from reaching the state of</p>
<p>purity necessary for the inner worship he is now to perform.</p>
<p>How to destroy these obstacles ritually is now described:</p>
<p>He who knows the mantras, driving away the obstacles in the temple of the sacrifi ce, will expel the obstacles that are on the earth by a kick with the heel, those in the atmosphere by clapping the hands,</p>
<p>//92// and with the <em>astramantra</em> and the casting of a glance those that are in the sky.</p>
<p><em>yāgamandiragāṁścaiva vighnān utsārya mantravit</em> /</p>
<p><em>pārṣṇighātena bhaumāṁśca tālena ca nabhogatān</em> //92//</p>
<p><em>astramantreṇa dṛṣṭyā ca divyān vighnān apohayet</em> /</p>
<p>Tantric rites can only be performed in a place or an area that is perfectly pure, free from all impurities and (more) all evil, dangerous, or impure forces, hence this threefold rite, whose pattern is customary. The casting of a glance ( <em>ī kṣaṇa</em> or <em>nirīkṣaṇa</em> ) is used in many circumstances in the Hindu world for ritual or spiritual reasons.</p>
<p>[Thereafter] one must visualize mentally with precision the form of a great fi re [shining] in all directions, above and below. //93//</p>
<p><em>dikṣvadhordhvaṁ mahāvahniprākāraṁ paribhāvayet</em> //93//</p>
<p>The Dī , true to its metaphysical interpretation of the YH, says that this great fi re is nothing other than the Supreme Consciousness fl ashing forth everywhere. This fi re, it adds, must be impassable so that none of the obstacles resulting from dualistic thought may enter the consecrated area of the sacrifi ce or the mind of the offi</p>
<p>ciating adept who has mentally con-</p>
<p>structed this luminous image.</p>
<p>O mistress of the gods! one is to perform with the common <em>arghya</em> the worship of Mārtaṇḍa accompanied by the energy of light. He is of a red color, resplendent, //94// surrounded by the Seizers, and others, manifesting the brilliance of the universe.</p>

<p>Mārtaṇḍa is a name of the sun god, Sūrya. The worship of the sun ( <em>sūryapūjā</em> ) is the fi rst item of the daily mandatory ( <em>nitya</em> ) ritual worship ( <em>pūjā</em> ) of Śiva. The sun is generally considered golden but is also seen as red, especially in the Āgamas or Tantras. When represented in human form, he is often white with a red garment. Red is the color of the Goddess; it is also the color of passion, attachment, and <em>vimarśa</em> , self-consciousness, while <em>prakāśa</em> , light, is white, the color of Śiva. Insofar as Mārtaṇḍa manifests the universe, he is on the side of <em>vimarśa</em> and redness.</p>
<p>The Seizers (Graha), who number nine, are, as we have seen before (see chapter 2, <em>śloka</em> 58), the planets, but they are also demonic, dangerous supernatural beings who “seize” their victims. The planets, too, are seizers insofar as they “seize,” or infl uence, human beings. The “others” ( <em>ādi)</em> are the six “limbs” ( <em>aṅga</em> ) of Śiva, <em>hr̥daya</em> , <em>śiras</em> , <em>śikha</em> , and so on, 26 according to the Dī ; but <em>ādi</em> , in <em>grahādi</em> , can also be understood as “the sun being the fi rst ( <em>ādi</em> )” (of the Seizers).</p>
<p><em>Arghya—</em> there is no satisfactory translation of the term <em>—</em> is the specially prepared water off ered as oblation to a deity. 27</p>
<p>The sun worship having been performed (neither the YH nor the Dī</p>
<p>describes it), the worship of the Goddess can begin:</p>
<p>O Goddess! one must make appear in the right manner the king of <em>cakras</em> [drawing it] with orpiment, agalloche, and kunkuma mixed with lunar and igneous [substances] while reciting the <em>mūla</em> [ <em>mantra</em> ]</p>
<p>of the Yoginīs. //95–96a//</p>
<p><em>saumyāgneyayutair devi rocanāgurukuṇkumai ḥ</em> //95//</p>
<p><em>mūlam uccārayan samyag bhāvayec cakrarājakam</em> /</p>
<p>By “in the right manner,” the YH means “following carefully the instructions given by an expert.” Orpiment ( <em>rocana</em> , also called <em>gorocana</em> ) is a mineral form of arsenic, of a yellow color. Agalloche is also a yellow stuff , as is kunkuma (turmeric). The lunar ( <em>saumya</em> ) substance is camphor, which is white, like the moon; while the igneous or fi ery one is saf-fron, “for it looks like a fl ame,” says the Dī , which also explains that these items are to be mixed “with nectar,” <em>sudha</em> , a term usually synonymous with <em>amṛta</em> . It may, however, also mean powder; <em>maṇḍalas</em> to be used only once are most often drawn with powders. The Dī explains, too, that the <em>śrīcakra</em> is to be drawn on a sheet of gold “or another” ( <em>ādi</em> ) material with a needle of gold. It adds that some experts say that the diagram may be drawn “with musk, saff ron, camphor, sandal, and nectar.”</p>
<p>120
The <em>mūlamantra</em></p>
<p>to be recited is that of the manifest Yogin</p>
<p>ī s( <em>prakaṭayoginī</em> ), says the Dī ; see our commentary on <em>śl</em> . 90 above.</p>
<p>Then one must throw on it flowers held in one’s joined hands.</p>
<p>//96// Or [one may adorn it] with gems and coral while [reciting]</p>
<p>the <em>mūlavidyā</em> backward One must, in all cases, ensure that [the <em>cakra</em> ] is not empty, [ for] if it were empty, the obstacles would be innumerable. //97//</p>
<p><em>yoginīmūlamantreṇa kṣipet puṣpāñjaliṁ tata ḥ</em> //96//</p>
<p><em>maṇimuktāpravalair vā vilomaṁ mūlavidyayā</em> /</p>
<p><em>aśūnyaṁ sarvadā kuryāt śūnye vighnās tvanekaśa ḥ</em> //97//</p>
<p>The rule that the <em>cakra</em> or the chalice used for the ritual worship of a Tantric deity must never be empty of the prescribed off erings is a general rule. In the case of Bhairava, the Tantrāloka says that if the chalice were empty, the god, always furious and voracious, would immediately devour the adept. More sedately, the Dī says that if the <em>cakra</em> were empty of these off erings during the worship, the ritual would be fruitless.</p>
<p>[The <em>sādhaka</em> ] must place the <em>arghya</em> between the <em>śrīcakra</em> and himself on [a fi gure] of six angles inside a square, O Beloved of the gods!</p>
<p>//98// where, after having worshipped the six <em>āsanas</em> and having honored successively inside the triangle the four <em>pīṭhas</em> Kā, Pū, Jā, O, //99// he must sacrifi ce on the place of the <em>arghya</em> to the ten <em>kalās</em> of Fire.</p>

<p><em>arcayitvā ‘rghyapāde tu vahner daśa kalā yajet</em> /</p>
<p>The Dī describes the diagram in which a six-angled fi gure with a small triangle in its center is inscribed in a circle, which is inside a square. The chalice into which the <em>arghya</em> has been poured (the <em>arghyapātra</em> ) is to be placed on this inner small triangle. The Dī gives the names of the six <em>āsanas</em> who seem to be throne deities (or deities of the throne), sacralizing, as it were, the “throne,” the place of the <em>arghyapatra</em> . 28</p>

<p>Kā, Pū, Jā, and O are the initials of the names of the four main <em>pīthas</em> of theṣrīvidyā tradition, Kāmarūpa, Pūrṇagiri, Jālandhara, and Oḍyāna, as we have already seen in chapter 1, ( <em>ślokas</em> 41–43).</p>
<p>The <em>kalās</em> are energies associated with a deity and formed (or symbolized) by letters of the Sanskrit alphabet. Fire as a deity (Agni) has ten <em>kalās</em> associated with the last letters, from <em>YA</em> to <em>KṣA</em> . 29</p>
<p>Once the <em>arghyapātra</em> is placed, [the offi</p>
<p>ciant] must perform there a</p>
<p>sacrifi ce to the twelve <em>kalās</em> of the Sun. //100// He will [thus] worship on the chalice the <em>kalās</em> of the Sun [associated with the letters]</p>
<p><em>KA-BHA</em> , etc. Then, with clarifi ed butter and [another] substance, he will off er a sacrifi ce to the sixteen <em>kalās</em> of the Moon. //101//</p>
<p><em>arghyapātraṁ pratiṣṭhāpya tatra sūryakalā yajet</em> //100//</p>
<p><em>pātre sūryakalāś caiva kabhādi dvādaśārcayet</em> /</p>
<p><em>vighṛte tu punar dravyeṣoḍaśendukalā yajet</em> //101//</p>
<p>The <em>sādhaka</em> is to worship a (mental) image of the sun god in the center of the chalice by invoking its image in his heart while uttering its mantra and worshipping its twelve <em>kalās</em> , associating each with one of twelve letters of the Sanskrit alphabet from <em>KA</em> to <em>THA</em> and from <em>BHA</em> to <em>Ḍ A</em> , while uttering their names, this being done with an off ering of perfumed water. The sixteen <em>kalās</em> of the moon are worshipped in the same way, with the sixteen fi rst letters of the alphabet, from <em>A</em> to <em>visarga</em> , 30 and sprinkling of clarifi ed butter associated with “another substance,” which, according to the Dī , is wine ( <em>madya</em> ). 31</p>
<p>And in its center he must meditate intensely on Amṛteśīwith the Navātma[mantra]. Then, with the Navātman, O Goddess! he must</p>
<p>make a libation of the goddesses of the constituent elements [of the body] //102// and to Ānandabhairava with [a mantra] ending with <em>vauṣaṭ.</em></p>
<p><em>amṛteśīṁ ca tanmadhye bhāvayed ca navātmanā</em> /</p>
<p><em>navātmanā tato devi tarpayed dhātudevatā ḥ</em> //102//</p>
<p><em>ānandabhairavaṁ caiva vauṣaḍantena tarpayet</em> /</p>
<p>Amṛteśī, “the Mistress of the Nectar,” is a goddess who pours <em>amṛta</em> on the world, thus helping and stimulating it. The Navātmamantra is usually given as <em>HSKṣMLVRYŪ Ṃ</em> . It is an important mantra of the Trika.</p>
<p>122
It is also the mantra form of the beautiful god Navātma, the consort of the crooked goddess Kubjikā, the main deity of the Tripurā tradition of the Kula. We translate the verb <em>bhāvayet</em> as “meditate intensely,” which implies a mental concentration so intense as to create in the mind of the adept a precise image of the deity. Anandabhairava is a form of the god Bhairava. The mantra ending with <em>vauṣaṭ</em> is the Navātmamantra to which is added <em>ānandabhairavāya vauṣaṭ</em> . 32</p>
<p>The best of <em>sādhakas</em> must also prepare carefully, in the same way, the special <em>arghya</em> . //103//</p>
<p>Having worshipped the sandals of the [succession of ] masters, he must then off er this <em>arghya</em> to Bhairava. Being impelled by the latter’s order, he must off er it to the succession of masters. //104//</p>
<p><em>tathaivārghyaṁ viśeṣeṇa sādhayet sādhakottama ḥ</em> //103//</p>
<p><em>gurupādālim āpūjya bhairavāya dadet puna ḥ</em> /</p>
<p><em>tadājñāpreritaṁ tacca gurupaṅktau nivedayet</em> //104//</p>
<p>The sandals or footprints ( <em>pādukā</em> ) of the gurus are those of all the masters of the tradition of Tripurā, from Śiva to one’s own guru. These <em>pādukas</em> are metaphysically the imprint, the trace of the presence of the supreme deity in this world; to worship them is therefore to worship the deity as present in this world. The <em>gurupūjā</em> is a mandatory element of the fi rst part of the Tantric <em>pūjā.</em></p>
<p>In this tradition, the succession of the gurus is deemed to go through three stages, called flows ( <em>ogha</em> ). First, the divine ( <em>divya</em> ) flow, starting with Śiva followed by four masters, one for each of the four cosmic cycles, the <em>yugas</em> from <em>Kṛtayuga</em> to <em>Kaliyuga</em> ; then the flow of perfect or accomplished masters ( <em>siddhaugha</em> ); and fi nally, the human ones ( <em>mānavaugha</em> ), the succession of the masters of this world, going from the fi rst revelation of the doctrine to our days. The Dī tells how to worship them: the <em>arghya</em> is to be elevated three times up to his head by the offi</p>
<p>ciant, then off ered to</p>
<p>Bhairava, who, as the Master, is in a triangle in the center of the “forest of the great lotus,” which, as we have seen ( <em>śl.</em> 3–5), is on the <em>brahmarandhra</em> .</p>
<p>Having collected what remains of it, one must perform [with it] an oblation in the fi re of desire where the whole universe is burning while reciting the <em>mūlavidyā</em> and the [ formula of worship of ] the sandals of the Master. //105//</p>

<p><em>tadīyaṁ śeṣam ādāya kāmagnau viśvatastviṣi</em> /</p>
<p><em>pādukāṁ mūlavidyāṁ ca japan humaṁ samācaret</em> //105//</p>
<p>As is underlined at length by the Dī , this oblation is not so much a material as a symbolic rite. Actual pouring may take place, but the process is a mental, spiritual one. The offi</p>
<p>ciant, namely, is to imagine</p>
<p>the Master as standing on his head, and, as the Master (the godhead) orders, he is to off er mentally in the “fi re of consciousness,” that is, to the supreme godhead in her aspect of cosmic destruction, the whole creation together with his own mental constructions. It is an oblation consisting of symbolically throwing duality into the fi re of consciousness in order to burn it entirely.</p>
<p>In spite of the symbolic nature and meaning of the oblation, what remains of it after it has been off ered to the deity is supposed to be absorbed by the offi</p>
<p>ciant.</p>
<p>The YH explains further its metaphysical value:</p>
<p>One must pour in oblation, together with the internal organ or</p>
<p>intellect, the activity of the rays of light in the great light [located] in the mouth of Kuṇḍalī, where the resorption and vomiting forth of the cosmic flow take place. //106//</p>
<p><em>mahāprakāśe viśvasya saṁsāravamanodyate</em> /</p>
<p><em>marīcivṛttir juhuyān manasā kuṇḍalīmukhe</em> //106//</p>
<p>The YH pursues the metaphysical aspect of the oblation:</p>
<p>Conceiving the unity of I-ness and objectivity as being in the ladle <em>srùc</em> , which is <em>unmanī</em> , what is born there through the intensity of the rubbing is the great oblation. //107// Pouring and pouring himself the oblation, [the adept] becomes spontaneous bliss.</p>
<p><em>ahantedantayor aikyam unmanyāṁ sruci kalpitam</em> /</p>
<p><em>mathanodrekasambhūtaṁ vasturūpaṁ mahāhavi ḥ</em> //107//</p>
<p><em>hutvā hutvā svayaṁ caivaṁ sahajānandavigraha ḥ</em> /</p>
<p>The ladle <em>srùc</em> is one of the two ladles used since Vedic times for off ering the ritual oblation in the fi re, the <em>homa</em> . This ladle, in the present case, is not a material object. It is the “transmental” ( <em>unmanī</em> ), the highest</p>
<p>plane of consciousness. 33 It is on this level that the oblation takes place;</p>
<p>124
it consists of pouring (in spirit) all the aspects of the cosmic manifestation in the central, both human and divine, void of consciousness. This is why a “spontaneous” (that is, uncaused) bliss arises in the offi ciating</p>
<p>adept. The Dī says: “Having poured again and again the full oblation (both human and divine) of clarifi ed butter, which in reality is the total fusion of the objectivity and the I-ness ( <em>ahāntā</em> ) 34 born from the rubbing of the</p>
<p><em>araṇis</em> of the mantra, [one reaches] the supreme fulgurating bliss. Such is the internal oblation.”</p>
<p>According to a passage of the Dī (which also quotes stanza 72 of the Vijñānabhairava), the oblation may be made of <em>amṛta</em> and may even include an alcoholic substance <em>—</em> a possibility the Dī mentions again when, commenting the next half- <em>śloka</em> , it says that a wise man is somebody who, because he drinks alcohol, keeps his mind concentrated in a single intent. From this concentration ( <em>dhāraṇā</em> ), meditation ( <em>dhyāna</em> ) is born: “without concentration, the worship is fruitless.” Thus, having off ered to the Masters, Śiva, and so forth, alcohol transformed into nectar ( <em>amṛta</em> ) and having poured it in off ering into the fi re of the self, the spirit of the adept will become perfectly stable, and he will experience the supreme, blazing bliss. The practice is mental, spiritual, rather than actually performed with an alcoholic beverage.</p>
<p>Thus, as stated in the next half- <em>śloka</em> :</p>
<p>The wise [adept] must then perform the worship of the <em>śrīcakra</em> , the form that the expansion of his consciousness takes as it spreads out. //108//</p>
<p><em>svaprathāprasarākāraṁ śrīcakraṁ pūjayet sudhi ḥ</em> //108//</p>
<p>The <em>śrīcakra</em> can be said to be the form taken by the adept’s consciousness as it spreads out, because in the nonduality of consciousness ( <em>saṁvidadvaya</em>) of Kashmir Shaivism, there is no diff erence between</p>
<p>human consciousness and the deity’s absolute consciousness. To quote the Dī : “What shines (i.e., appears) as the <em>śrīcakra</em> is nothing else than the cosmic expansion of the godhead who is his (the adept’s) consciousness, an expansion formed by the fourfold <em>antahkarana</em> , the inevolute ( <em>avyakta</em> ), the <em>mahant</em> , and the <em>ahaṁkāra</em> , along with the subtle elements ( <em>tanmātra</em> ), the ten senses ( <em>indriya</em> ), their ten activities, their objects, the <em>puryaṣṭaka</em> , and the expansion [which goes down] to the gross elements ( <em>dhātu</em> ) and</p>
<p>[ forms] the sixteen ‘evolutes’ ( <em>vikāra</em> ).” 35</p>
<p>Now comes the description of the <em>śrīcakra pūjā</em> proper, <em>ślokas</em> 109–168.</p>

<li>The śrīcakra pu*¯ *jā *</li>
</ul>
<p>This <em>pūjā</em> consists of the worship of Tripurasundarī and her retinue of ancillary deities: of the several deities abiding in the <em>śrīcakra</em> , from those in the outer square section to the Goddess in the central triangle. The worship is followed by the <em>japa</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> and a fi nal off ering in the fi re, a <em>homa</em> .</p>
<p>A sacrifi ce 36 to Gaṇeśa and to Dūtarī, to the Master of the Field, and to Dūtī is to be performed, O Goddess! as also, on the external door, to the goddesses headed by Svastikā. //109//</p>
<p><em>gaṇeśaṁ dūtarīṁ caiva kṣetreśaṁ dūtikāṁ tathā</em> /</p>
<p><em>bāhyadvāre yajed devi devīśca svastikādikā ḥ</em> //109//</p>
<p>The Dī explains that the ritual worship of the fi rst group of deities is to be performed “on the frame of the door” of the outer square section of the <em>śrīcakra</em> . The Master of the Field, Kṣetreśa or Ksetrapāla, is the god Baṭuka, an aspect of Bhairava; Dutī is his consort. The goddesses headed by Svastikā, worshipped on the external part of the door, number fi ve; they are “singing goddesses” ( <em>gāyikā</em> ), deemed to delight Tripurasundarī with their songs.</p>
<p>Then the line of masters, which abides, threefold, in the inner triangle is also [to be worshipped].</p>
<p><em>tataś cāntastrikoṇe ‘pi gurupaṅktiṁ tridhā sthitam</em> /</p>
<p>The succession of the masters of the Tripurā tradition is said to be threefold because, as we have seen ( <em>śl</em> . 104), starting from Śiva, it is divided into three groups: divine, perfect, and human gurus. This succession is secret, says the Dī. It is not to be found in books but learned by word of mouth.</p>
<p>and in this [ <em>baindavacakra</em> ] he will worship, after having invoked her, the great Goddess //110// who holds herself in the forest of the great lotus, resting against my side, her body [fi lled with] the joy of the</p>
<p>“cause”: You, Goddess, who gives the fruits that the will desires! //111//</p>
<p>[This] worship is to be performed with off erings of food, etc., of which you are yourself formed.</p>
<p><em>tadantaś ca mahādevīṁ tām āvāhya yajet puna ḥ</em> //110//</p>
<p><em>mahāpadmavanāntasthāṁ kāraṇāndavigrahām</em> /</p>
<p>126
<em>madaṅkopāśrayāṁ devīm icchākāmaphalapradām</em> //111//</p>
<p><em>bhavatīṁ tavanmayair eva naivedyādibhir arcayet</em> /</p>
<p>The “Forest of the Great Lotus,” as we have seen ( <em>śl</em> . 5), is the <em>akula</em> lotus of one thousand petals on the summit of the <em>suṣumnā</em> . It is therefore on a spot of his own yogic body that the adept is to mentally perform this worship. The ritual process of the <em>pūjā</em> appears here <em>—</em> as it will do again later <em>—</em> as a total process, both bodily and mental. The Goddess is seen in this lotus leaning against Bhairava, on whose left thigh she is sitting.</p>
<p>As for the “cause” ( <em>kāraṇa</em> ) 37 that fi lls her with joy, it is an alcoholic beverage, as is appropriate in a Tantric ritual. This, says the Dī , when drunk by the Goddess, becomes nectar and fi lls her body with joy, her body being henceforth pure, supreme, luminous bliss.</p>
<p>The off erings of “food, etc.,” are the usual ritual off erings of perfume, food, lights, incense, and flowers, each corresponding to one of the fi ve constitutive gross elements of the cosmos and of the body: earth, water, fi re, air, and space, elements of which the Goddess is also constituted insofar as she is identical with the cosmos.</p>
<p>The Dī expatiates at length on the metaphysical symbolic interpretation of these off erings; as interesting as they are, these developments are too long and complex to be reported here.</p>
<p>Then, on the triangle, [one must worship] the refl ected forms of her fl ashing forth, //112// the Nityās made of all the <em>tithis</em> , their aspects being those suitable for optional rites.</p>
<p><em>trikoṇe tatsphurattāyā ḥ pratibimbākṛtīḥ puṇa ḥ</em> //112//</p>
<p><em>tattattithimayīr nityā ḥ kāmyakarmānurūpiṇī ḥ</em> /</p>
<p>This worship is to be performed on the three lines of the central triangle. The Nityās (the Eternal Ones) are ancillary deities numbering sixteen, identifi ed with the phonemes of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , which surround the Goddess. They are also identifi ed with the <em>tithis</em> , the lunar days,</p>
<p>which are divine entities and also number sixteen. 38 The *śrīcakrapūjā *</p>
<p>being performed to attain a desired ( <em>kāmya</em> ) goal, all the rites it includes are so-called optional or desiderative ( <em>kāmya</em> ) rites; the mentally visualized forms of all the deities must therefore be adapted to that type of worship. 39</p>

<p>There, in the Trailokyamohana[cakra], are the manifested Yoginīs.</p>
<p>//113// Because they are gross forms of the <em>mātṛkā</em> , these Yoginīs pervade the skin, etc. They are known as manifest for they are [located in a <em>cakra</em> ] whose nature is to support the gross world. //114//</p>

<p>The skin is one of the seven constituent elements of the organic body which are therefore gross ( <em>sthūla</em> ), a character shared by the so-called manifest Yoginīs, who, appropriately, abide (and are worshipped) in the outer square part of the <em>śrīcakra</em> (also named <em>bhūgṛha</em> , “underground room”), a part that can be said to support the world, since it is the section of the diagram that is metaphysically on the level of the manifested universe. It is also the plane of <em>vaikharī</em> , the lowest, gross level of the Word ( <em>vāc</em> ).</p>
<p>[There, too,] abide the eight <em>siddhis</em> Aṇimā and the others, O great Goddess! They are deep red in color; their hands make the gesture of propitiation and protection. //115// They hold the great fabulous gem and thus give the fruit one desires.</p>

<p>like Brahmā, Maheśvarīcarrying Śiva’s (Maheṣvara’s) attributes, Vaiṣṇavī</p>
<p>those of Viṣṇu, and so on.</p>
<p>Having thus visualized [these goddesses], one must worship them, then [worship] Tripurā, mistress of the <em>cakra</em> .</p>
<p>Because she purifi es the organs of action, she is called She Who Accomplishes the Purifi cation of the Hands; //125// and there is found the <em>siddhi</em> Aṇimā arising from the purifi cation of the hands.</p>
<p>*evaṁ dhyatvā yajed etāś cakteśīṁ tripurāṁ tata ḥ * /</p>

<p>*kāryaśuddhibhavā siddhir aṇimā cātra saṁsthitā * /</p>
<p>The purifi cation of the hands ( <em>karaśuddhi</em> ) is a mandatory preliminary ritual, since in order to perform ritual acts of worship of a deity, the hands of the offi</p>
<p>ciant must be perfectly pure. This rite normally</p>
<p>consists of imposing on the hands the <em>astra</em> (weapon) mantra. Here it is the Goddess who is symbolically deemed not only to purify but also to cause the <em>siddhi</em> goddess Aṇimā to exist. But why Aṇimā? Because, says the Dī , the <em>siddhi aṇimā</em> (and thus the goddess Aṇimā) reduces the self, the living being (of the offi</p>
<p>ciating adept), to its fi nest, most</p>
<p>subtle state.</p>
<p>The worship in the second <em>cakra</em> , the sixteen-petaled lotus, is then described:</p>
<p>In the group of sixteen vibrations, the <em>kalās</em> whose nature is wonder //126// are what animate the sixteen vital breaths, <em>prāṇa</em> , etc.</p>
<p>They are seeds because their nature is that of vowels; they have the form of seeds because they incite. //127// Because they are internal, the Yoginīs who abide [there] are hidden. They are Kāmākarṣaṇā, etc. Since they dominate in emanation, O Dear One! //128// they are to be worshipped [going from right] to left in the <em>cakra</em> called Sarvāśāpūraṇa.</p>
<p>*ṣ oḍaśaspandasaṁdohe camatkṛtimayīḥ kalā ḥ * //126//</p>

<p><em>sarvāśapūraṇākhye tu cakre vāmena pūjayet</em> /</p>
<p>130
These stanzas must be explained. The Yogin</p>
<p>ī s that abide in the</p>
<p>sixteen-petaled lotus of the <em>śrīcakra</em> are identifi ed with an aspect of the cosmic vibration that animates the universe, the <em>spanda</em> . This <em>spanda</em> is said, in the present case, to be sixteen-fold, being identifi ed with the sixteen “vowels” of the Sanskrit alphabet, which, inṣaiva cosmogonies, are the sixteen <em>kalās</em> , limiting energies, of Bhairava when he manifests the cosmos. Their nature is described as “wonder” ( <em>camatkāra</em> ), by which is meant that they are pervaded with consciousness ( <em>cit</em> ), that is, subtle. They are also identifi ed with the vital breaths, <em>prāṇa, apāna</em> , <em>udāna</em> , and so on, which, in fact, are usually considered to number only ten, not sixteen: “the names of the six others can be found in other <em>āgamas</em> ,” says the Dī , without quoting any reference. These <em>kalās</em> , being active, are “seeds” ( <em>bīja</em> ),</p>
<p>which is the case of the “vowels.” 41</p>
<p>The Yoginīs abiding in this inner portion of the <em>śrīcakra</em> are called Guptayoginīs (see above, *śl. * 90). This, says the Dī , is because they are evolutes that are pervaded with consciousness. They are to be worshipped in the reverse order, starting from the right, not simply because they are Tantric deities but, says the Dī , because they are associated with the emanation that is done by “vomiting” ( <em>vāmena</em> ,) the universe.</p>
<p>They hold the noose and the goad; they are red and clothed in red.</p>
<p>//129// The <em>siddhi</em> of he who enjoys [them] is lightness, made of the purifi cation of the breaths. Tripureśī, mistress of the [ <em>śrī</em> ] <em>cakra</em> , must be worshipped with all the ritual services. //130//</p>

<p>*prāṇaśuddhimayīsiddhir laghimā bhoktur ātmana ḥ * /</p>
<p>*tripureśīca cakreśīpūjyā sarvopacārai ḥ * //130//</p>
<p>Since the aspect of pure, nondiscursive consciousness pervades this <em>cakra</em> , <em>laghimā</em> , the supernatural power of lightness (the <em>prāṇas</em> being also purifi ed), it is, quite naturally, the power deemed to be given by these secret Yoginīs to the adept who worships them.</p>
<p>This part of the worship ends with a renewed ritual worship of the main Goddess to which all the prescribed ritual services ( <em>upacāra</em> ) are to be off ered. The lists of <em>upacāras</em> vary, going from fi ve to thirty-six; they are off erings of lights, incense, food, flowers, clothes, jewels, and so forth, all that can be off ered to a distinguished guest. In a Tantric context, the variety of the <em>upacāras</em> , pure or impure, is very great.</p>

<p>Now comes the worship in the third <em>cakra</em> , the eight-petaled lotus: Linked to the enjoying</p>
<p><em>puryaṣṭaka</em></p>
<p>absorbed in the experience</p>
<p>of the body, subtle, associated with the eightfold <em>vāgbhava</em> , having for essence the classes of phonemes, //131// all these Yoginīs, Anaṅgakusumā, etc., are very hidden [and are to be worshipped]</p>
<p>in the [ <em>cakra</em> ] Sarvasaṁkṣobhana. They are adorned with red cuirasses, //132// beautiful, their braids of hair hanging down, carrying bow and arrows.</p>

<p>*veṇī kṛtalasatkeśās cāpabāṇadharā ḥ śubhā ḥ * /</p>
<p>The <em>puryaṣṭaka</em> , “the eight in the body,” is the subtle transmigrating body, a nonmaterial, all-pervading soul, which, while the person lives, is absorbed in the experience (the enjoyment, <em>bhoga</em> ) of the body it animates.</p>
<p>The “eightfold <em>vāgbhava</em> ” is the phoneme <em>AI</em> repeated eight times with the eight Yoginīs whose essence ( <em>svarūpa</em> ) is constituted by the classes ( <em>varga</em> ) of consonants of the Sanskrit alphabet. The very hidden ( <em>guptatara</em> ) Yoginīs are one of the several categories of Yoginīs of the Śrīvidyā tradition.</p>
<p>Parameśvarī, mistress of this <em>cakra</em> , is purifi cation of the intellect.</p>
<p>The quality she possesses is beauty. //133// She rests on the planes of <em>piṇḍa</em> , etc., of the Lord, the subject who enjoys all that can be enjoyed, which is to say, the intellect and the variety of all [that the intellect perceives]. //134// Her nature is the supernatural power of growing at will. She must be worshipped with all the ritual off erings and services.</p>

<p>*mahimāsiddhirūpā ca pūjyā sarvopacarākai ḥ * /</p>
<p>To say that Parameśvarī is purifi cation of the intellect means that the intellect is purifi ed when it reaches her level. The intellect ( <em>buddhi</em> ) is the</p>
<p>132
plane of consciousness that grasps the objects of the senses whose savor is enjoyed by the supreme subject, Śiva, who, as the Dī says, is therefore called the “knower of the fi eld” ( <em>kṣetrajña</em> ) of perception.</p>
<p>The expression “planes of <em>piṇḍa</em> , etc.,” refers to the conception of the subtle body as including four ascending planes called <em>piṇḍa</em> , <em>pada</em> , <em>rūpa</em> , and <em>rūpātīta</em> , planes also conceived of as tiered along the <em>suṣumnā</em> ; the highest of these, <em>rūpātīta</em> , is on the consciousness level of <em>turīya</em> , where</p>
<p>one attains liberation. 42</p>
<p>To say that the nature ( <em>rūpa</em> ) of Parameśvarī is the supernatural power of growing at will is to say that she bestows that <em>siddhi</em> .</p>
<p>[This worship is to be performed] by a penetration, going up to the extreme point of the <em>visarga</em> , of consciousness, which fl ashes forth while piercing the twelve knots after experiencing energy.</p>
<p>//135b–136a//</p>
<p>*dvādaśagranthibhedena samulasitasaṁvida ḥ * //135//</p>
<p><em>visargāntadaśāveśācchāktānubhavapūrvakam</em> /</p>
<p>The Dī explains this obscure stanza as follows. Consciousness here is, in fact, the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> , which ascends following the path of the <em>suṣumnā</em> along which are tiered twelve subtle centres ( <em>granthi</em> ) <em>—</em> the usual six <em>cakras</em> and six “knots” placed between them <em>—</em> and goes up to a center called <em>ṣ oḍaśānta</em> (“end of sixteen”), probably to be imagined as sixteen fi ngers-breadths above the head. This ascending energy within the body of the adept, being Consciousness, is luminous; it fl ashes forth. The same movement was described previously in chapter 2, <em>śl</em> . 71 of the YH: “Shining like ten million fl ashes of lightning, . . . she attaches herself to the maṇḍala of the moon of the inner sky”. This was said above about the inner ascent of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> ; the same experience is taking place here. Here the maṇḍala of the moon is not mentioned, but with sixteen being a lunar number, 43 the <em>ṣ oḍaśānta</em> is also a “lunar” center. This ascent is described as “going up to the *visarga, * ” because the <em>visarga</em> is the sixteenth “vowel” of the Sanskrit alphabet; saying <em>visarga</em> is therefore equal to saying “sixteen.”</p>
<p>While performing this worship, the adept is to cause his <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> to go up to this center. This is one of the cases in which a yogic process is to take place during a ritual action. As we know, in Tantra, yoga and rites cannot be entirely separated; they are two aspects of the total, both bodily and mental, active experience of ritual.</p>

<p>*Encounter in the Worship *</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>[The worship is to be done] with [what is born] from the expansion of the energy of awakening, the predominance of the energy of will,</p>
<p>//136// and with the four phonemes formed by her unifying interaction with <em>akula</em> , [then] with the phonemes the main of which is <em>SA</em> , vapor of the knowable, and with those that are produced by the mixed energy of will, //137// accompanied by the two phonemes</p>
<p>corresponding to the absorption in the energy of <em>kula</em> . [Thus,] by the expansion of the essence of the energy, O Maheśvarī, //138// [is to be performed] in the Sarvasaubhāgyadāyaka <em>cakra</em> [the worship of the Yoginīs] received through traditional transmission.</p>

<p><em>saṁpradāyakramātās cakre saubhāgyadāyake</em> /</p>
<p>The worship, progressing toward the center, is to be done now in the next three <em>cakras</em> : the fi rst of fourteen angles and the two others of ten angles. The practice is based on the so-called <em>bhūtalipi</em> , the “writing <em>—</em></p>
<p><em>lipi—</em> of the elements,” 44 of forty-two letters. We saw previously the place of yoga in ritual; we see now the role of the letters. The Sanskrit alphabet (as we have said before) is divine, appearing fi rst, and being eternally present, in the supreme godhead and thus the source and origin of the whole cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>The above stanzas fi rst enumerate the letters of the <em>bhūtalipi</em> . These are to be visualized by the adept as present in the so-called <em>akula</em> white, thousand-petaled lotus turned downward placed on the <em>brahmarandhra-cakra</em> , on the top of the head. There is the fi rst letter of the alphabet, <em>A</em> , which is the supreme Śiva. It is in “unifying interaction” ( <em>saṁghaṭṭa</em> ) with the energies of will ( <em>icchā</em> , hence <em>I</em> ) and of awakening ( <em>unmeśa</em> , hence <em>U</em> ); we have thus <em>A +I = E</em> , <em>A + U = O. Akula/A</em> now interacts with <em>E</em> and <em>O</em> , which gives <em>AI</em> and <em>AU</em> . The process goes on in the same way in order to produce all forty-two letters of the *bhūtalipi. * The “phonemes of which the main is <em>SA</em> ” are the sibilants <em>ŚAṣA SA</em> and the aspirate <em>Ḥ A</em> , usually called vapor ( <em>ūṣman</em> ), and so forth. We cannot decrypt here the whole procedure to produce all the letters.</p>
<p>134
The last stanza underlines the fact that the expansion of the energy of will ( <em>icchāśakti</em> ) realized in the ascent of the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> is the eff ective element of this worship of the Yoginīs present in this <em>cakra</em> . These are said to be “received through traditional transmission,” not because they are more received than the other ones by the tradition transmitted by the gurus but because they are called Sampradāyayoginīs, “traditional Yoginīs.” 45</p>
<p>These Yoginīs are now described:</p>
<p>O goddess! the [Yoginīs] having at their head Sarvasaṁkṣobhiṇī , mag-nifi cent, looking like Aṇimā, [are those to be worshipped] in the <em>cakra</em> whose name agrees with what it is, by uniting oneself to the force of the beauty that spreads without interruption. //140// The <em>siddhi</em>īśitva, also, purifi er of the body, the senses, etc., in the triple city already described, to be realized, [along with] Tripuravāsinī, by destroying the original impurity of the conjunction [with duality]. //141// All these</p>
<p>[deities], O Goddess, must be worshipped with all the off erings.</p>

<p>*etā ḥ saṁpūjayed devi sarvā ḥ sarvopacārakai ḥ * /</p>
<p>The name of the <em>cakra</em> is Sarvasaubhāgyadāyaka, “the giver of all felicities,” which agrees with its nature, since it is deemed to bestow on the adept all forms of felicity. The Yoginīs, Sarvasaṁkṣobhinī, and so on, look like Aṇimā, and so on, since, like these, they are clothed in red and bear the same ornaments. The “force of the beauty that spreads without interruption” with which the worshipper is to unite is the power born from the uninterrupted intense meditation on the nonduality from Śiva ( <em>śivādvaitabhāvanā</em> ): 46 this mental state is apparently to be maintained by</p>
<p>the adept during the worship of the Yoginīs of this <em>cakra</em> .</p>
<p>The Siddhiīśitvā, also worshipped there, gives the adept the state of Śiva, which implies, says the Dī , the purifi cation of the body and of the senses of the adept and also of the objects. This threefold purifi cation gives to the adept the state ofīśvara. To say that it takes place “in the triple city” ( <em>pūratraye</em> ) means that “the knower, knowledge, and the known,”</p>

<p>the perceiving person and what he perceives <em>—</em> man and the world he perceives—are “purifi ed,” (mentally) deifi ed, understood <em>sub specie aeternitatis</em> .</p>
<p>Worship in the fi fth (ten-angled) <em>cakra</em> , Sarvārthasādhaka, is as follows:</p>
<p>[The energy of the Goddess in the fi fth <em>cakra</em> ] takes on the nature of the eternal <em>nādas</em> abiding in the nine apertures, //142// along with a general and common aspect while being made of distinct</p>
<p>sounds. [She is manifested] by ten phonemes, shadows of the movable and immovable objects of knowledge. //143// They are the</p>
<p>Kulakaulikāyoginīs who bestow all the powers or perfections.</p>

<p>*kulakaulikayoginya ḥ sarvasiddhipradāyikā ḥ * /</p>
<p>Here, too, the Yoginīs to be worshipped are identifi ed with phonetic aspects of the divine energy experienced by the offi</p>
<p>ciant as present in his</p>
<p>body, a spirit-mind-body experience.</p>
<p><em>Nāda</em> is a subtle form of sound, a stage in the process of dissolution of uttered sound or phonemes into the silence of the Absolute. It is not audibly perceptible; it is “unstruck,” <em>anāhata</em> , sound, being a form of <em>śabdabrahman</em> , the cause of the apparition and of the effi</p>
<p>cacy of the phonemes. In spite of this</p>
<p>unique and absolute nature, <em>nāda</em> is sometimes considered divisible, divided in eight, nine, or ten <em>nādas</em> , often associated with diff erent parts of the yogic body; such is the case here. The nine apertures ( <em>randhra</em> ) are nodal points, <em>cakras</em> , of the yogic body. The Dī describes them as parts of the inner space ( <em>gaganabhāga</em> ) of the <em>suṣumnā</em> and enumerates them: “ <em>mūlādhāra</em> , <em>svādhisthāna</em> , <em>maṇipūra</em> , <em>anāhata</em> , then above these <em>vajrapadma</em> , <em>kaṇṭha</em> , <em>laṁbikā</em> , <em>viṣuddha</em> , and *ājñā, * ” of which only the fi rst four and the last three are the usual <em>cakras</em> of this system.</p>
<p>As the Dī also explains, the Goddess, in addition to these “distinct sounds,” is present in the body in a general way as an indistinct sound ( <em>nirviśeṣadhvani</em> ).</p>
<p>The ten phonemes that manifest her are the cerebrals and the dentals. They are “shadows” of the various objects of knowledge in that they are deemed to manifest these objects. The long commentary of the Dī on this stanza is rich and interesting but too abstruse to be given here.</p>
<p>White, clothed in white, wearing white ornaments, //144//</p>
<p>the [Kulakaulayogin</p>
<p>ī s] Sarvasiddhipradā, etc., are in the</p>
<p>136
Sarvārthasādhaka <em>cakra</em> , whose name agrees with what it is because of the expansion of the proper nature of the mantras that takes place [there]. //145//</p>

<p><em>mantrāṇāṁ svaprathārūpayogād anvarthasaṁjñake</em> /</p>
<p><em>sarvasiddhipradādyās tu cakre sarvārthasādhake</em> //145//</p>
<p>The “expansion of the mantras,” according to the Dī , means that they help the offi</p>
<p>ciant to realize that the true nature of his self is the same as that of the “absolute I” of Śiva ( <em>śivāhambhāvabhāvanā</em> ). Because such a mystical realization takes place in this <em>cakra</em> , it is called Sarvārthasādhaka, “fulfi ller of all wishes,” the highest of which is, of course, the wish for union with Śiva, which is precisely being fulfi lled in this <em>cakra</em> (says the Dī ).</p>
<p>The Mistress of the <em>cakra</em> is Tripurāśrī, O Great Sovereign! [named thus] because she is the cause of the prosperity of the three worlds.</p>
<p>In addition, born from the purifi cation of the mantras, //146// it is said [that she gives] the power of subjugation. All these [deities]</p>
<p>must be worshipped.</p>

<p><em>vaśitvasiddhir ākhyātā etā ḥ sarvā ḥ samarcayet</em> /</p>
<p>Tripurāśrīmeans “prosperity of the three cities,” that is, of the three worlds <em>—</em> of the universe, in other words. The purifi cation of the mantras, it is explained, results from the prolongation of their utterance ( <em>uccāra</em> ) <em>—</em></p>
<p>in the case of *O Ṃ * , *HRĪṂ , * etc. <em>—</em> from the fi nal *Ṃ * to the transmental ( <em>unmanā</em> ) plane, where the utterance disappears in the utter silence of the Absolute. If the adept is able to ascend to such a supreme level, he acquires the supernatural power to subjugate all beings ( <em>ī śitva</em> ).</p>
<p>Worship in the sixth (ten-angled) <em>cakra</em> , Sarvarakṣākara, is as follows: O Goddess! the phonemes <em>KA</em> , etc., as they expand, are manifested by the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> facing upward and [then] downward //147// when she externalizes herself by the will of Kula. They are manifested by the supreme interior Yogin</p>
<p>ī s, Sarvajñā, etc., located in the</p>
<p>Sarvarakṣākara <em>cakra</em> , which, being totally absorbed in its own inner</p>

<p>nature, brings about total absorption. These [Yoginīs] carry a book and a rosary. //148–149//</p>

<p>The divine energy, <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> , facing fi rst upward, reaches the supreme; then, facing downward, coiling back in the <em>mūlādhāra</em> , she manifests the universe through the phonemes <em>KA</em> , and so on, the consonants. This she does by the will of Kula, the deity, as identical with the cosmos (or, as the Dī says, holding in herself the thirty-six <em>tattvas</em> , together with the pho-</p>
<p>nemes). 47 These are manifested by the ten Nigarbha (“interior”) Yoginīs whose names begin always with Sarva, abiding as they do in the <em>cakra</em> Sarvarakṣākara (“causing total protection”).</p>
<p>In this <em>cakra</em> , the offi</p>
<p>ciant, is supposed to be absorbed in his own nature</p>
<p>or essence ( <em>svarūpāveśa</em> ), thinking, “I am the supreme Śiva.” “Through this absorption,” says the Dī , “the deity shines without duality in the sixth <em>cakra</em> , which produces in the worshipper a total absorption in Śiva,” while the <em>cakra</em> protects him from everything that could hinder his spiritual search.</p>
<p>Nourishing the [three] cities of the knowing subject, the knowable, and knowledge, the mistress of this <em>cakra</em> , magical enchantress of this world, is called Tripurāmālinī. //150//</p>
<p><em>mātṛmānaprameyāṇāṁ purāṇāṁ paripoṣinī</em> /</p>
<p><em>tripurāmālinīkhyātā cakreśīsarvamohinī</em> //150//</p>
<p>We have already seen the triad of knowing subject, knowledge, and known ( <em>mātṛmānaprameya</em> or <em>mātṛ</em> , <em>māna</em> , <em>meya</em> ) used to designate the totality of the world, which the Goddess both nourishes by her <em>śakti</em> and deludes by her <em>māyā</em> .</p>
<p>The supernatural power that is purifi cation of the energy of the *vidyā * is called <em>prākāmya</em> . All these goddesses must be worshipped with all the ritual services. //151//</p>
<p>138
<em>vidyāśaktiviśuddhiṁ ca siddhiṁ prākāmyasaṁjñitām</em> /</p>
<p><em>etā ḥ sarvopacāreṇa pūjayed devatā ḥ kramāt</em> //151//</p>
<p>The energy of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , says the Dī , is “expressed,” that is, manifested, by her phonemes. It is in reality the power of the all-powerful Supreme Consciousness. The <em>siddhi</em> given here is therefore quite naturally <em>prākāmya</em> , irresistibility. The adept who acquires it can transform himself or act freely everywhere, like Śiva.</p>
<p>Now comes the worship in the seventh, eight-triangled</p>
<p><em>cakra</em> ,</p>
<p>Sarvarogahara, destroyer of all illnesses, with all the mental constructions that go with it:</p>
<p>As the knots open because of the unifying interaction of the vital breaths when becoming immobile, [the energy] extending from</p>
<p>the root- <em>granthi</em> to the heart, where consciousness is, as the void subtle transmigrating body, [one must worship] the goddesses, the secret Yoginīs, Vaśinī, etc., abiding, O Beloved of the heroes, in the Sarvarogahara <em>cakra</em> , in the blazing fi re of destruction of the <em>saṁsāra</em> , by following the groups of consonants touched by the <em>kalās</em> of the vowels, which are seeds. //152–154a//</p>

<p><em>rahasyayoginīr devīḥ saṁsāradalanojjvale</em> //153//</p>
<p><em>sarvarogahare cakre saṁsthitā vīravandite</em> /</p>
<p>The worship in this case consists, for the offi</p>
<p>ciating adept, of mak-</p>
<p>ing his <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> go up from the “root- <em>granthi</em> ,” the <em>mūlādhāra</em> , that is, to the heart <em>cakra</em> , the <em>cakras</em> (or <em>granthis</em> ) between these two points being “opened,” awakened, by the conjunction (</p>
<p><em>saṁghaṭta</em> ) <em>—</em> which</p>
<p>consists, in fact, of their immobilization <em>—</em> of the <em>prāṇa</em> and <em>apāna</em> vital breaths. These two breaths stop in the central void of the heart, which is where the subtle transmigrating body (the <em>puryaṣṭaka</em> ) is generally supposed to stay. Therefore, there arises in the adept a subtle, “void”</p>
<p>state of mind.</p>
<p>The Dī expresses this as follows: “meditating on [the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> ] as a snake whose brightness is made to palpitate by the syllable *HU Ṃ * , one</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*Encounter in the Worship *</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>makes it go upward together with the ascent of the breath and the thought.</p>
<p>Thus, the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> rises up from the <em>mūlādhāra</em> . As an expert master says: ‘then one must meditate in the lotus of the heart the blazing power of consciousness,’ the adept’s consciousness, blazing in his heart, being the self which is consciousness itself ( <em>cidātman</em> ).”</p>
<p>This mental process also has a phonetic aspect, the Yoginīs to be worshipped there being associated with the sixteen “vowels,” from <em>A</em> to <em>visarga</em> (also called here <em>kalās</em> ) associated with the groups ( <em>varga</em> ) of consonants, <em>KA</em> , <em>CA</em> , and so on, these syllables being what brings about the presence of the secret <em>—</em> Gupta <em>—</em> Yoginīs who are to be worshipped. Their subtlety, says the Dī , explains why they are in the Sarvarogahara <em>cakra</em> where the fi re of cosmic destruction is deemed to be present, its fi re being able to destroy the “illness” ( <em>roga</em> ) of the <em>saṁsāra</em> , “impermanent, stained, and impure.”</p>
<p>The Yoginīs endowed with supernatural powers, Vaśinī, and so forth, are red in color, [their hands] forming the gesture of protection and of reassurance and holding the book and the rosary.</p>
<p>//154b–155a//</p>
<p>The <em>siddhis</em></p>
<p>of enjoyment and the</p>
<p><em>siddhi</em></p>
<p>of pure knowledge,</p>
<p>O Maheśvarī, //155// [and] Tripurasiddhi, mistress [of this <em>cakra</em> , all these deities] are to be worshipped by the off ering of drops [of <em>arghya</em> ].</p>

<p>*ī śvarīṁ tripurāsiddhim pūjayed bindutarpaṇai ḥ * /</p>
<p>Pure knowledge ( <em>śuddhavidyā</em> ), says the Dī , is the consciousness of the nonduality of the subject and the object: all is pure, unique, divine Consciousness. The realization of the nonduality of consciousness ( <em>saṁvidadvaita</em> ), of the nonduality with Śiva, is the highest, liberating knowledge. “Thus, the supernatural power of enjoyment [ <em>bhukti</em> ] is the great power to enjoy the whole diversity of the world gained by the adept when worshipping in this seventh <em>cakra</em> .” This he does, adds the Dī , “by off ering drops of <em>arghya</em> , together with unhusked grains of barley corn ( <em>akṣata</em> ) and flowers, with the *mudrā * of union of Śiva and Śakti made by joining the thumb and the little fi nger.”</p>
<p>140
The <em>pūjā</em> in the eighth (three-angled), Sarvasiddhimāyā, <em>cakra</em> is now described:</p>
<p>O Goddess! [the Yoginī] whose nature is that of the three energies, auspicious, splendid, and powerful flow of consciousness,</p>
<p>//156// forms of the fi re of cosmic destruction, supremely secret, are the cause of the supernatural power whose nature is fullness and nonfullness, O Sureśvarī! In the <em>cakra</em> called Sarvasiddhimaya, adorned by the divine weapons, are the four deities of the <em>pīṭhas</em> with Kāmeśvarīat their head. //158//</p>
<p>*śaktitrayātmikā devi ciddhāmaprasarā ḥ śivā ḥ * //156//</p>

<p><em>sarvasiddhimayākhye tu cakre tvāyudhabhūṣite</em> /</p>
<p>*sthitā ḥ kāmeśvarīpūrvāś catasra ḥ pīṭhadevatā ḥ * //158//</p>
<p>The deities in this <em>cakra</em> are, by their nature, nearer to the Goddess than the Yoginīs we saw previously. They are more important ones.</p>
<p>The three energies are the three basic energies of Śiva: will, knowledge, and action ( <em>icchā</em> , <em>jnāna</em> , <em>kriyā</em> ). Consciousness, says the Dī , is the Supreme Consciousness named Ambikā, the Mother; her splendor ( <em>dhāman</em> ) is made of light rays ( <em>kiraṇa</em> ) whose expansion ( <em>prasara</em> ) is the cosmic vibration ( <em>spanda</em> ) produced by the three regents of the cosmos identifi ed here with the three energy goddesses Vāmā, Jyeṣṭhā, and Raudrī. The four regents of the ages of the world (the <em>yuganāthas</em> ) are also there.</p>
<p>All these entities form the fi rst circle of deities surrounding the Goddess. They are said to be forms of the fi re of destruction ( <em>saṁvartāgni</em> ), for when one approaches the Goddess, the world tends to disappear. The power they bestow is fullness, because it is the complete absorption ( <em>samāveśa</em> ) in the supreme Śiva. It is also nonfullness, because it includes the totality of the cosmic manifestation. The Siddhi present here, having these two aspects, gives liberation in life ( <em>jīvanmukti</em> ).</p>
<p>The <em>pīṭhas</em> are the four sacred seats of the Goddess, the ritual and spiritual (more or less mythical) centers of this tradition. They are Kāmarūpa, Pūrṇagiri, Jālandhara, and Oḍḍīyāna, as we have already seen. 48 Kāmeśvarī</p>
<p>is the fi rst of a group of four goddesses; the three others are Vajreśvarī,</p>

<p>Bhagamālinī, and Tripurasundarī. Only the fi rst three are in this <em>cakra</em> , Tripurasundarī residing in the next, central, <em>cakra</em> .</p>
<p>As for the weapon deities, shining with an intense red brilliance, each carrying its weapon on its head, their hands making the gesture of reassurance and protection, they are to be worshipped.</p>
<p>They give the fruit desired by those who visualize them in meditation. //159// They are yours and mine and bestow power on men</p>

<p>*tvadīyāśca madīyāś ca puṁstrīvaśyavidhāyina ḥ * /</p>
<p>All Tantric deities are represented as holding in their hands objects called weapons ( <em>āyudha</em> ), which are sometimes arms (bow and arrows, for instance), sometimes tools (such as a goad) or various symbolic objects.</p>
<p>Although objects, <em>āyudhas</em> , being elements of a divine fi gure, are considered deities, <em>devatās</em> , and may in such cases be represented (or, as is the case here, be visualized by <em>dhyāna</em> ) as human fi gures bearing their “weapons” on their heads. They are then to be worshipped as deities, bestowing boons on their worshipper. They can also be associated with phonemes or mantras.</p>
<p>O Sureśvarī! these arrows of yours are associated with the second vowel, their nature being that of [the constituent elements of the body,] skin, blood, fl esh, fat, and with what follows bone and marrow. //160b–161a//</p>
<p><em>tvagaṣṛṇmāṁsamedo ‘sthimajjārṇāntā ḥ sureśvari</em> //160//</p>
<p>*dvitīyasvarasaṁyuktā ete bāṇās tvādīyakā ḥ * /</p>
<p>We are to understand here that the arrows are associated with the mantras of the <em>dhātus</em> , the constituent elements of the body, which are formed by the second vowel, <em>Ā</em> , of the Sanskrit alphabet and by one of fi ve consonants and ending with *Ṃ * . These consonants are the four semivowels, <em>YA</em> for the skin, <em>RA</em> for the blood, <em>LA</em> for the fl esh, <em>VA</em> for fat, and “what follows bone and marrow,” which is <em>SA</em> , for semen, which is designated in this way because, in the lists of the <em>dhātus</em> , <em>semen</em> ( <em>śukra</em> ) usually follows bone and marrow. The mantras of the fi ve arrows to be used in the</p>
<p>142
worship to invoke them are (as given in the Dī ): *YĀ Ṃ * , *RĀ Ṃ * , *LĀ Ṃ * , *VĀ Ṃ * , and *SĀ Ṃ * .</p>
<p>[The Mistress of this <em>cakra</em> is] Tripurāmbikā, who generates the three cities Vāmā, etc., //161// These [deities], O Lovely-faced Woman, are to be worshipped with all the ritual off erings and services. [They bestow] the supernatural power of unlimited will because their</p>
<p>nature is that of supreme freedom. //162//</p>

<p><em>parasvātantryarūpatvād icchāsiddhir maheśvari</em> /</p>
<p><em>etā ḥ sarvopacāreṇa pūjayet tu varānane</em> //162//</p>
<p>Vāmā is one of the three main goddesses surrounding</p>
<p>Tripurasundarī: Vāmā, Jyeṣṭhā, and Raudrī. They are called “cities” probably because they are near Tripurasundarī, the “Beautiful [Mistress] of the Three Cities.” The Dī , however, says that it is because they are presided over by Kāmeṣvarī, whose nature is that of the three basic energies, <em>icchā</em> , <em>jñāna</em> , and <em>kriyā</em> .</p>
<p>Then comes the worship in the ninth, central, <em>cakra</em> :</p>
<p>In the supreme Sarvānandamaya <em>cakra</em> , O Goddess, whose nature is that of the supreme <em>brahman</em> , one must worship with all freedom of practice Mahātripurasundarī, [supreme] consciousness, who is both egoity and objectivity. She is the great Kāmakalā. She gives the supernatural power of [attaining], the <em>vidyā</em> , the <em>pīṭhas</em> , and so forth.</p>
<p>//163–164//. [This] goddess, the great <em>mudrā</em> , must be worshipped.</p>
<p><em>sarvānandamaye devi parabrahmātmake pare</em> /</p>
<p><em>cakre saṁvittirūpā ca mahātripurasundarī</em> //163//</p>
<p>*svairācāreṇa saṁpūjyā tvahantedantayo ḥ samā * /</p>
<p>*mahākāmakalārūpā pīṭḥ avidyādysiddhidā * //164//</p>
<p><em>mahāmudrāmayīdevīpūjyā</em></p>
<p>That the supreme Goddess should be <em>parabrahman</em> and consciousness goes without saying. The Dī adds, however, that she is, for the worshipper, the goddess of his own consciousness ( <em>svasaṁviddevatā</em> ), underlining thus the <em>saṁvidadvaita</em> (the “nonduality of consciousness”) conception of the Trika: that there is only one conscious principle, Śiva, of which the</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*Encounter in the Worship *</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>individual consciousnesses of human beings are merely aspects. It is in this respect that she is equally *ahantā * and <em>idanta</em> , both the absolute pure I and the multiplicity of the objective world.</p>
<p>Tripurasundarī is also “the great Kāmakalā.” This refers to the <em>kāmakalā</em></p>
<p>diagram, symbolizing the union of Śiva and Śakti, which we have already seen in chapter 2, <em>śl</em> . 21.</p>
<p>She is to be worshipped with all freedom of practice ( <em>svairācāreṇa</em> ), that is, says the Dī , “with elements pleasing to the senses and whose nature is what the worshipper desires,” a practice, it adds, characterized by an intense one-pointed mental concentration on the blazing pulsation ( <em>pari-sphurat paramānusaṁdhāna</em> ) of the supreme. Tantric worship, as we have already seen, implies the total mental and bodily, intensely lived participation of the offi</p>
<p>ciant in the ritual action. The Dī quotes here stanza 74 of</p>
<p>the <em>Vijñānabhairava</em> : “Wherever the mind of the individual fi nds satisfaction, on this supreme point the mind is to be fi rmly concentrated, for the supreme bliss shines intensely there.”</p>
<p>The <em>siddhi</em> gained here is <em>prāpti</em> , the power to attain everything. Here it is the power to realize the nature of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , to reach (symbolically) the four <em>pīṭhas</em> of the Śrividyā tradition, and to unite with the four deities, Kāmeśvarī, and so on, all of which gives the adept the power to rest in the supreme, on the plane “beyond the fourth” ( <em>turyātīta</em> ) 49 <em>—</em> and therefore to be omnipotent, like Śiva.</p>
<p>The great <em>mudrā</em> is the <em>yonimudrā</em> , which is in this <em>cakra</em> because it is a triangle, the triangle being the usual symbolic representation of the feminine sexual organ, the <em>yoni</em> . We have seen the <em>yonimudrā</em> in chapter 1, <em>śl</em> . 70b–71a.</p>
<p>Made up of fi fteen [syllables] and as many <em>tithis</em> , eternal, she is the ninth supreme Bhairavī//165// [to be worshipped in] each <em>cakra</em> , together with the <em>mudrās</em> described in the [fi rst chapter] “Encounter in the <em>cakra</em> .”</p>

<p>*praticakraṁ samudrās tu cakrasaṁketakoditā ḥ * /</p>
<p>The Goddess is said to be made up of fi fteen syllables, because the <em>srīvidyā</em> of fi fteen syllables is herself in her mantric aspect. She is also made up of the <em>tithis</em> , the fi fteen lunar days, because they form together the whole moon, another totality. In fact, the number of the totality (and of the moon) is not fi fteen but sixteen. The Dī explains, therefore, that</p>
<p>144
if one adds to the fi fteen <em>tithis</em> or syllables of the *śrīvidyā * the <em>ṣ rīvidya</em> as a whole, taken as a unit, one has 15 + 1 = 16. The *mūlavidyā * worshipped in this central triangle is thus seen as made up of her separate syllables plus their ensemble, thus being sixteenfold.</p>
<p>The Goddess is to be worshipped also in the whole <em>śrīcakra</em> , since she pervades it entirely.</p>
<p>The worship in the nine <em>cakras</em> of the <em>śrīcakra</em> ends with another ritual worship:</p>
<p>The sage must perform a sacrifi ce to Nityaklinnā, etc., using</p>
<p>optional rites, //166// either in the triangle or in the intermediate space of the square.</p>
<p>*nityaklinnādikāś caiva kāmyakarmānusārata ḥ * //166//</p>
<p>*caturasrāntarāle vā trikoṇe vā yajet sudhīḥ * /</p>
<p>Nityaklinnā is placed on the left side of the central triangle between two other goddesses, Kāmeśvarīand Bhagamālinī. The other goddesses of the inner retinue of Tripurasundarī(meant by “etc.”) are thirteen Nityās. 50 They are to be worshipped either in the central triangle or on the sixteen-petaled lotus, meant here by “the intermediate space of the square.”</p>
<p>The use of so-called optional rites ( <em>kāmyakarmaṇi</em> ), that is, rites undertaken to attain a desired object, is normal in the present Tantric context, since the worship of all these deities gives <em>siddhis</em> , which are desired ( <em>kāmya</em> ) by the adept. The Dī describes these rites as consisting of “flowers, visualizing meditation [ <em>dhyāna</em> ], syllables, etc., adapted to such optional rites as subjugation, etc.” The next stanza is more explicit:</p>
<p>Having honored the deities with alcohol, pieces of cooked meat, perfumes, and incense, //167// the worship of the <em>cakra</em> is thus accomplished. [The offi</p>
<p>ciating adept] must [then] off er the lamp of</p>
<p><em>kula</em> , blazing with its own splendor, shining forth internally and externally, O Dear One! //168//</p>

<p><em>antarbahirbhāsamānaṁ svaprakāśojjvalaṁ priye</em> //168//</p>
<p>The term we give here in English as “alcohol” is <em>hetu</em> , which means</p>
<p>“cause.” It is one of the several terms used to mean an alcoholic beverage without mentioning it explicitly.</p>

<p>The off ering of lights to the deity is the waving of lights in front of the image, which is a part of all <em>pūjās</em> (called <em>arati</em> , it is nowadays often its main, if not its sole, part).</p>
<p>This action is here metaphysically interpreted,</p>
<p><em>kula</em></p>
<p>being, as we</p>
<p>have seen, one of the terms used to mean the body, whether cosmic or human. <em>Kula</em> , says the Dī , is “the body made of the thirty-six <em>tattvas</em> ”, in other words, the whole world, which is thus symbolically off ered to the Goddess. But the Dī also interprets this as follows: this lamp “is the dynamism of consciousness shining in the lotus of the heart and which, through the senses, shines in the same way in all objects.” “This lamp it adds, “shines by its own light, which is the direct intuitive perception of the supreme reality,” the act of off ering being, for the adept, “the inner quiescent tranquillity [ <em>viśrānti</em> ] in consciousness that he experiences when turning inward.”</p>
<p>Now comes the last rite of this <em>pūjā</em> , the <em>japa</em> .</p>
<ul>
<li>Japa *</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>japa</em> is the mandatory penultimate act of all <em>pūjās</em> (normally, but not here, followed by an off ering in the sacrifi cial fi re, a <em>homa</em> ).</p>
<p>It consists of reciting a more or less large number of times the root mantra, the <em>mūlamantra</em> , of the deity being worshipped. This is, however, not the case here, for this <em>japa</em> is, in fact, a long and complex meditative and yogic practice in which the enunciation( <em>uccāra</em> ) of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , associated with the ascent of the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> , is accompanied by mental visualizations of elements of the <em>śrīvidyā</em></p>
<p>imagined (and, to a certain extent, experienced) as taking place in the yogic body of the adept together with the ascent of <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> .</p>
<p>We have described its general pattern above in the introduction.</p>
<p>Here we will follow, with the help of the Dī , the details of the process as described (or alluded to) in stanzas 169b–189a. (See table 3.1.)</p>
<p>Then, having done the <em>añjali</em> with flowers, he must practice <em>japa</em> with a composed and steady mind. //169a//</p>

<p>*śabalākārake devi tṛtīye dvādaśīkalā * //173//</p>
<p>This fi rst part of the <em>japa</em> is to proceed as follows: The adept is to imagine that along his <em>suṣumnā</em> are tiered the nine constituent <em>cakras</em> of the <em>śrīcakra</em> (from its square outside part to the central triangle), each associated with one of the nine <em>cakras</em> of his yogic imaginal body, from the <em>mūlādhāra</em> to the <em>dvādaśānta</em> . Going upward along this axis, the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> is conceived of as being threefold. Its lower part, from <em>mūlādhāra</em></p>
<p>to the heart</p>
<p><em>cakra</em> ( <em>hr̥daya</em> or <em>anāhata</em> ), is the so-called <em>agnikuṇḍalinī</em> ; it is fi ery and associated with emanation, <em>sṛṣṭi</em> . Then, from heart to <em>bhrūmadhya</em> (the <em>cakra</em> between the eyebrows, also called <em>bindu</em> or <em>ājñā</em> ), extends the <em>sūryakuṇḍalinī</em> , which is solar and associated with conservation, <em>sthiti</em> . Third, from <em>bhrūmadhya</em> to <em>dvādaśānta</em> , rises the <em>somakuṇḍalinī</em> , which is lunar and linked to resorption, <em>saṁhāra</em> .</p>
<p>This conception of the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> as in three sections that have respectively the nature of fi re, sun, and moon is found in several Tantric Śaiva texts. Its point seems to be to give a cosmic dimension to the ascent of the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> .</p>
<p>148
Now the adept is to imagine that in the <em>mūlādhāra</em> lies the fi rst part, or <em>kūṭa</em> , of the <em>ṣ rīvidyā</em> , *HA SA KA LA HRĪṂ * . Then, in the heart <em>cakra</em> , is the second <em>kūṭa</em> , *HA SA KA HA LA HRĪṂ * ; and in the <em>bhrūmadhyā</em> is the third <em>kūṭā</em> , *SA KA LA HRĪṂ * . The enunciation of these three *HRĪṂ * , like that of all <em>bījas</em> ending with *Ṃ * ( <em>bindu</em> ), is deemed (as said in *śl. * 170) to be prolonged by a subtle phonic vibration, the <em>nāda</em> , which goes through eight ever subtler phonic stages, the so-called <em>kalāṣ</em> , named <em>ardhacandra</em> , <em>rodhinī</em> , <em>nāda</em> , <em>nādānta</em> , <em>śakti</em> , <em>vyāpinī</em> , <em>samanā</em> , and <em>umanā</em> , with the last,</p>
<p>“transmental,” <em>kalā</em> , which fi nally dissolves in the silence of the Absolute.</p>
<p>This being so, the <em>japa</em> consists, for the offi</p>
<p>ciant, of the mental enun-</p>
<p>ciation ( <em>uccāra</em> ) of the three <em>kūṭas</em> of the <em>śrividyā</em> , enunciating fi rst their letters, from <em>SA</em> or <em>HA</em> to the <em>bindu</em> , *Ṃ * , then prolonging the <em>uccāra</em> of *Ṃ * by the eight <em>kalās</em> , from <em>ardhacandra</em> to <em>samanā</em> , this subtle vibration ascending for the fi rst <em>kūṭa</em> from <em>mūlādhāra</em> to the heart, for the second <em>kūṭ</em> a from the heart to the *bhrūmadhya, * and for the third <em>kūṭa</em> from <em>bhrūmadhya</em> to the <em>dvādaśānta</em> , where it reaches its ultimate form, <em>unmanā</em> , the “transmental.” This it does, however, together with the <em>unmanās</em> of the two fi rst *HRĪṂ * , with which it intermingles (this is why it is called “modifi ed” in <em>ṣ l</em> . 173b). There the phonic vibration unites with and disappears in the Absolute. The <em>kalās</em> are said by the YH to number twelve, because one is to add to the eight subtle ones, <em>ardhacandra</em> to <em>unmanā</em> , the four elements that constitute *HRĪṂ * : <em>H Rī</em> + <em>bindu</em> .</p>
<p>This <em>japa</em> is thus not a recitation but a purely mental mantric utterance ( <em>mantroccāra</em> ), conceived by the adept as carrying upward the three parts of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , through the <em>cakras</em> of his yogic body united with the constitutive parts of the <em>śrīcakra</em> , with the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> and with his mind, to the highest level of sound vibration, where it merges in Mahātripurasundarī, supreme Consciousness. It is a complex, both visual and phonic-mental, process. It is a mental process, we note, that also has a cosmic dimension, since, as it unfolds from distinct syllables to <em>unmanā</em> , it includes, with the three</p>
<p><em>kūṭas</em></p>
<p>, the whole cosmic process, from emanation to</p>
<p>resorption, a process parallel to, isomorphic with, the phonic one, which goes from distinct sound to the silence of the Absolute and, implicitly, from ordinary waking awareness ( <em>jāgrat</em> ) to the supreme nondualistic <em>turyātīta</em> state of mind. This <em>japa</em> , therefore, if eff ectively carried out, requires an extremely intense and diffi</p>
<p>cult mental/spiritual exercise in</p>
<p>creative imagination.</p>
<p>This, however, is only the fi rst part of the <em>japa</em> ; three other <em>japas</em> are now prescribed.</p>

<p>One must perform the <em>japa</em> mentally while meditating on the sixfold emptiness, O Goddess, the fi ve conditions of the mind, and the seven equalizations. //174//</p>
<p>*śūnyaṣaṭkaṁ tathā devi hyavasthāpañcakaṁ puna ḥ * /</p>
<p><em>viṣuvaṁ saptarūpaṁ ca bhāvayan manasā japet</em> //174//</p>
<p>These entities <em>—</em> the six emptinesses ( <em>śūṇya</em> ), the fi ve states or conditions ( <em>avasthā</em> ) of the mind, and the seven <em>viṣuvat</em> (a term we translate as</p>
<p>“equalization”), says the Dī , are to be meditatively realized ( <em>bhāvayet</em> ) in the constitutive elements of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> of which this is therefore a <em>japa—</em></p>
<p>of a particular sort.</p>
<p>Dividing into groups of three [the <em>kalās</em> of the <em>uccāra</em> ] from <em>agni</em> to the <em>dvādaśānta</em> , O Fair-Faced Woman! one will give birth to the threefold emptiness, each [of the emptinesses] being in the interval between each [of the groups of three], O Dear One! //175// In the supreme abode, beyond the threefold emptiness, one is to meditate on the great emptiness.</p>
<p><em>agnyādidvādaśānteṣu trīṁstrīṇtyaktvā varānane</em> /</p>
<p><em>śūnyatrayaṁ vijānīyād ekaikāntara ḥ priye</em> //175//</p>
<p><em>śūnyatrayāt pare sthāne mahāśūnyaṁ vibhāvayet</em> /</p>
<p>Although called “threefold” ( <em>śūṇyatrayam</em> ), there are six emptinesses.</p>
<p>They are linked to the ascending enunciation ( <em>uccāra</em> ) of <em>HRĪṂ —</em> its letters, then its <em>kalās—</em> the <em>śūṇyas</em> being imagined as nodal points placed on the level of a <em>kalā</em> between two others, beginning with the <em>R</em> of *HRĪṂ *</p>
<p>(called <em>agni</em> , since <em>RA</em> is the <em>bīja</em> of fi re) and ending on the level of <em>unmanā</em> , which is in the <em>dvādaśānta</em> , as shown in table 3.1 above.</p>
<p>The offi</p>
<p>ciating adept is apparently to meditate intensely on these imaginary points. The Dī explains that he is to see in his mind the <em>śūṇyas</em> looking like “the multicolored circles adorning the feathers of a peacock,” for which it quotes sūtra 32 of the <em>Vijñānabhairava</em> : “If one meditates on the fi ve voids [using as support] the multicolored circles adorning the feathers of a peacock, one penetrates in the heart, supreme void.”</p>
<p>The Dī also quotes part of stanza 41 of the same text: “he will be absorbed in the marvelous ether of consciousness.”</p>
<p>The fi rst line of <em>śl</em> . 175 implies that there is a still higher, “emptier” level of emptiness, above the sixth one.</p>
<p>150
The YH then explains the meditation on the fi ve conditions of the mind, the <em>avasthas</em> : waking ( <em>jāgrat</em> ), dream ( <em>svapna</em> ), deep sleep ( <em>suṣupti</em> ), the “fourth” ( <em>turya</em> ) state, and the one “above the fourth” ( <em>turyātīta</em> ): The meditative realization of the waking senses, then, [must be done] through the state of waking, //176// in the fi re, O Goddess, a state of great wakefulness, together with the two [categories of ]</p>
<p>faculties.</p>
<p><em>prabodhakaraṇasyā ‘thā jāgaratvena bhāvanam</em> //176//</p>
<p>*vahnau devi mahājāgradavasthā tvindriyadvayai ḥ * /</p>
<p>The two categories of faculties are the fi ve organs or faculties of apperception ( <em>jñānendriya</em> or <em>buddhīndriya</em> ), sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, and the fi ve senses of action ( <em>karmendriya</em> ) corresponding to the functions of speaking, holding, walking, excreting, and copulating. These two categories correspond to two groups of <em>tattvas</em> in the classifi cation of the Sāṁkhya, categories that are active in the waking state. A meditative realization, an inner experience of the plane of consciousness corresponding to these sense experiences or activities is probably what the adept is supposed to have in this part of the <em>japa</em> .</p>
<p>The meditative realization of the great wakefulness is to take place “in the fi re” ( <em>vahnau</em> ), which is to say, the Dī explains, “in the letter <em>RA</em> present on the tip of the third <em>bīja</em> ,” 51 that is, in the  <em>R</em> of the *HRĪṂ * of the third <em>kūṭa</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā—</em> something we may fi nd diffi</p>
<p>cult to visualize but which is</p>
<p>important, since there is no <em>japa</em> without (at least a part of) a mantra.</p>
<p>Since there are fi ve ascending conditions of the mind, the meditative process of the <em>japa</em> goes on as follows:</p>
<p>[Linked] to the internal organs is the dream state revealed by *māyā *</p>
<p>//177// in the region of the throat.</p>
<p>*āntarai ḥ karaṇair eva svapno māyāvabodhana ḥ * //177//</p>
<p><em>galadeśe</em></p>
<p>The state of dream ( <em>svapna</em> ) is defi ned by the Dī as the condition of the knowing subject ( <em>pramātṛ</em> ) 52 when his mental activity is separated from</p>
<p>the senses of action and linked to the internal organs. The internal organ, the <em>anta ḥ karaṇa</em> , is made up of the three <em>tattvas</em> between the senses of apperception and <em>prakṛti</em> , namely the mind ( <em>manas</em> ), the principle of the</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*Encounter in the Worship *</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>ego ( <em>ahaṁkāra</em> ), and the intellect ( <em>buddhi</em> ). These are “revealed by <em>māyā</em> in the region of the heart,” which is, says the Dī , by the letter  *Ī * 53 of *HRĪṂ * to be felt and meditated as present in the region of the heart, which is the</p>
<p>“region of dream” ( <em>svapnasya sthānam</em> ).</p>
<p><em>Suṣupti</em> is the perception of what was previously dissolved with the dissolution of the domain of the movements of the internal organ.</p>
<p>//178// [The meditation bears here] on the preceding phonemes taken in the reverse order. It takes place on the <em>bindu</em> , between the eyebrows.</p>
<p><em>suṣuptis tu līnapūrvasya vedanam</em> /</p>
<p><em>anta ḥ karaṇavṛttīnāṁ layato viṣayasya tu</em> //178//</p>
<p>*pūrvārṇānāṁ vilomena bhrūmadhye bindusaṁsthitā * /</p>
<p><em>Suṣupti</em> is the state of deep sleep, where no dream appears. All mental activities stop there, because the movements of the internal organ, the <em>anta ḥ karaṇa</em> , of which one was conscious in the previous, dream state, have now disappeared. In this state, one is intensely conscious ( <em>parāmṛśyate</em> ) only of one’s self ( <em>svātma</em> ) and of happiness ( <em>sukha</em> ), says the Dī.</p>
<p>As for the <em>japa</em> to be done here, it would consist of meditating on the syllables of the central <em>kūṭa</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , the <em>śaktibīja</em> , taking them in reverse order, <em>LA KA SA</em> , these phonemes being meditated, visualized as being “on the <em>bindu</em> placed on the <em>hṛllekhā</em> (on the *Ṃ * of the *HRĪṂ * , that is) which is in the <em>bhrūmadhyacakra</em> ” <em>—</em> the *HRĪṂ * would thus be imagined as placed there, between the eyebrows. This part of the <em>japa</em> , like the others, is a yogic practice based on the structure of the mental image of the yogic body.</p>
<p>[The meditation] of <em>turya</em> is the grouping together there of the half-circle, etc. //179// Being the cause of the manifestation of consciousness, [this state] is knowledge of the nature of the *nāda. *</p>
<p>*turyarūpaṁ tasya cātra vṛttārdhades saṁgraha ḥ * //179//</p>
<p><em>caitanyavyaktihetos tu nādarūpasya vedanam</em> /</p>
<p><em>Turya</em> , the fourth condition of the mind, is above the three normal states of consciousness, being considered their cause. It is not merely peaceful but dynamic. In its <em>bhāvanā</em> , says the Dī , there appears an intense awareness ( <em>parāmarśa</em> ) of the phonic vibration, the <em>nāda</em> , of the *śrīvidyā * on the three levels of the <em>uccāra</em> following <em>bindu</em> : <em>ardhacandra</em> (the “half-circle”), <em>rodhinī</em> , and <em>nādānta</em> , these three <em>kalās</em> being considered as together “on</p>
<p>152
the apex of the third *bīja. * ” What the adept is to realize there, we are told, is the inciting ( <em>kalana</em> ) nature, the dynamism, of the <em>nāda</em> , which causes the</p>
<p>apparition of a pure consciousness of the self. 54</p>
<p><em>Turyātīta</em> , O Dear one, is a state of happiness. It is on the level of <em>nādānta</em> and what follows it. //181// In that very place, the awakened must, during the time of <em>japa</em> , remember the fi ve conditions of the mind.</p>
<p><em>turyātītaṁ sukhasthānaṁ nādāntādisthitaṁ priye</em> //180//</p>
<p>*atraiva japakāle tu pañcāvasthā ḥ smared budha ḥ * /</p>
<p>The Dī defi nes the essence of the condition of <em>turyātīta</em> as supreme bliss transcending word and thought ( <em>manovāgatītaparamānanda</em> ), which is, however, to be experienced on the level of <em>nādānta</em> , <em>śakti</em> , <em>vyapinī</em> , <em>samanā</em> , and <em>unmanā</em> , which are the “region of happiness” ( <em>sukhasthānam</em> ). This</p>
<p>“remembrance” 55 is to take place “in that very place,” which (according to</p>
<p>the Dī ) is to be understood “in the <em>śaktibīja</em> ,” the third <em>kūṭa</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> .</p>
<p>“He must remember” ( <em>smaret</em> ) is taken as the equivalent of <em>bhavayet</em> : he must meditate intensely. 56</p>
<p>Another series of <em>japa</em> follows now, that of the seven <em>viṣuvas</em> . There is no satisfactory translation of the term <em>viṣuva</em> because of our uncertainty about what the term designates. In astronomy, it is the equinox. More generally, it means a central or middle point, a point of equality or equalization, equilibrium. Here it evokes a point of equilibrium or equalization between the <em>prāṇa</em> , or <em>nāda</em> , of the mantra and some other element brought into play by the <em>japa</em> . With each of these <em>japas</em> , the adept would experience in mind and body a particular union with the phonic vibration, the <em>nāda</em> , of the <em>śrīvidyā</em></p>
<p>and would thus progress toward union with the supreme.</p>
<p>The <em>viṣuva</em> named <em>prāṇa</em> is the union of breath, the self, and the mind. //181//</p>
<p><em>yogaḥ prāṇātmamanasāṁ viṣuvaṁ prāṇasaṁjñakam</em> //181//</p>
<p>This description of the <em>prāṇaviṣuva</em> is clear enough, but neither the YH</p>
<p>nor the Dī explains how this union is realized or the role the *vidyā * may play in this practice.</p>

<p>the phonemes of the mantra, O Maheśvarī, //182// [then] perceiving that what has the nature of <em>nāda</em> 57 [rises] from the <em>anāhata</em> to the ultimate [ <em>cakra</em> , this is the <em>mantra</em> ] *viṣuva. *</p>

<p><em>anāhatādyādhārāntaṁ nādātmavicintanam</em> /</p>
<p><em>viṣuvam</em></p>
<p>“What assumes the form of the self” is the divine Consciousness. This Consciousness, assuming the form of the consciousness of the adept, is to be imagined as dissolved in the phonic vibration, the <em>nāda</em> , which rises from the <em>mūlādhāra</em> up to the <em>brahmarandhra</em> , a movement during which it is associated with the three parts of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> , fi rst taken separately, then taken together, and, in this case, considered as rising from the <em>anāhata</em> , the <em>cakra</em> of the heart, to the highest <em>cakra</em> . This is done, says the Dī , “enunciating up to the heart the <em>nāda</em> present on the apex of the <em>vāgbhava</em> (the third <em>kūṭa</em> ) which is in the <em>mūlādhāra</em> , and dissolving there. The spiritual experience the adept has by one-pointed attention ( <em>anusaṁdhāna</em> ) is that the real nature of his self is divine; such is the <em>mantraviṣuva</em> .”</p>
<p>What is called <em>nā ḍīviṣuva</em> is produced by the phoneme when the twelve <em>granthis</em> are pierced inside the <em>nā ḍī</em> in conjunction with the <em>nāda</em> , O Dear One! //183b–184a//</p>
<p><em>nādasaṁsparśān nā ḍīviṣuvam ucyate</em> //183//</p>
<p><em>dvādaśagranthibhedena varṇād nāḍyantare priye</em> /</p>
<p>The phoneme ( <em>varṇa</em> ), says the Dī , is the <em>kāmakalā akṣara—</em> the letter <em>Ī —</em> present on the apex of the three <em>kūṭas</em> , the letter *Ī * , that is, of the three *HRĪṂ * of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> . This phoneme is to pierce the twelve <em>granthis</em> , the</p>
<p>“knots,” namely the six <em>cakras</em> , from <em>mūlādhāra</em> to <em>brahmarandhra</em> and six intermediary knots, tiered along the <em>suṣumnā nā ḍī</em> . This ascending movement is associated with the equally ascending subtle phonic vibration, the <em>nāda</em> , of the three *HRĪṂ * , as we have seen in the fi rst *japa. * ; It is, in fact, practically the same mental yogic practice, with the same spiritual eff ect.</p>
<p>Conjunction with the <em>nāda</em> , the <em>praśānta</em> [ <em>viṣuva</em> ] falls within the range of the appeased senses. //184// One is to meditate the fi re,</p>
<p>154
<em>māyā</em> and <em>kalā</em> , <em>cetanā</em> , <em>ardhacandra</em> , <em>rodhin</em>ī, <em>nāda</em> and <em>nādānta</em> dissolved in <em>śakti</em> . //185//</p>
<p><em>nādayoga ḥ praśāntaṁ tu praśāntendriyagocaram</em> //184//</p>
<p><em>vahniṁ māyāṁ kalāṁ caiva cetanāṁ ardhacandrakam</em> /</p>
<p><em>rodhinīnādanādāntān śaktau līnāṇvibhāvayet</em> //185//</p>
<p>“The fi re is the letter <em>RA</em> , *māyā * is *Ī * , and <em>kalā</em> is the half- <em>kalā</em> following <em>SA</em> placed in the middle of this letter [ *Ī * ] which has the shape of a line. 58  *Cetanā * is the <em>bindu</em> which is the inner impulsion of consciousness [ <em>caitanya</em> ]. As for <em>ardhacandra</em> , <em>rodhinī</em> , etc., they are to be meditated on, being dissolved in <em>śakti</em> , as previously described,” 59 says the Dī. This is, it adds, because the energy here is the energy of the offi</p>
<p>ciant who thus feels appeased as he evokes mentally</p>
<p>this ascent of the phonic <em>kalās</em> of *HRĪṂ * along the way of the *kuṇḍalinī. *</p>
<p>The <em>viṣuva</em> named <em>śakti</em> is above her. [It consists of ] applying one’s thought to the <em>nāda</em> . Still above this is the <em>kālaviṣuva</em> , which extends up to <em>unmanā</em> , O Maheśvarī! //186// The perception of the <em>nāda</em></p>
<p>[lasts] <em>muni</em> , <em>candra</em> , eight and ten <em>tuṭis</em> .</p>
<p><em>viṣuvaṁ śaktisaṁjñaṁ tu tadūrdhvaṁ nādacintanam</em> /</p>
<p><em>tadūrdhvaṁ kālaviṣuvam unmanāntaṁ maheśvari</em> //186//</p>
<p>*municandrāṣṭadaśabhis tuṭibhir nādavedanam *</p>
<p>The <em>śaktiviṣuva</em> is “above <em>śakti</em> ” because it is to be meditated as extending up to the *samanā kalā. * The <em>kālaviṣuva</em> , the <em>viṣuva</em> of time, is still above it, since the adept is to consider its meditation as reaching the supreme level of <em>unmanā</em> , which transcends time.</p>
<p>The Dī explains that <em>muni</em> means seven, and <em>candra</em> means one. If one adds eight and ten, the length of the <em>uccāra</em> of the <em>vidyā</em> from the <em>HA</em> of *HRĪṂ * to <em>unmanā</em> would be ten thousand eight hundred seventeen <em>tuṭis</em> , a <em>tuṭi</em> being an extremely small division of time; it is described in a text quoted by the Dī as a hundredth part of the twinkling of the eye.</p>
<p>The equalization which is the cause of the manifestation of consciousness is called <em>tattva</em> [ <em>viṣuva</em> ]. //187//</p>
<p><em>caitanyavyaktihetuśca viṣuvaṁ tattvasaṁjñakam</em> //187//</p>
<p>This <em>viṣuva</em></p>
<p>is described in the D</p>

<p><em>nāda</em> during the length of time described above as counted in <em>tuṭis</em> , this being experienced on the level of <em>unmanā</em> —an experience of a purely transcendent state of consciousness, the summit of which is reached in the last, supreme <em>viṣuva</em> :</p>
<p>The supreme stage, O Great Goddess, is the beauty of uncreated bliss.</p>
<p><em>paraṁ sthānaṁ mahādevi nisargānandasundaram</em> /</p>
<p>This ultimate stage, says the Dī , transcends the sound and movement that existed in the fi ve vacuities and in the six preceding <em>viṣuvas</em> . Its beauty is “the beauty of the place of rest [ <em>viśrānti</em> ] of the universe,” which is the Absolute. It both includes and transcends all forms of bliss. It is the supreme level of the deity that is the cause and origin of all that exists and holds it in herself: it is the supreme Goddess as mistress and place of rest ( <em>viśrānti</em> ) of the world, for, as we may say, all is in God.</p>
<p>The YH concludes the passage on the <em>japas</em> as follows: Who applies thus his mind during the times [prescribed for] <em>japa</em> , O Pārvati! //188// will rapidly obtain all the supernatural powers thanks to your favor.</p>
<p>This being done, he must off er the <em>japa</em> to the Goddess in her left hand. //189//</p>
<p><em>evaṁ cintayamānasya japakāleṣu pārvati</em> //188//</p>
<p>*siddhaya ḥ sakalās tūrṇaṁ siddhyanti tvatprasādata ḥ * /</p>
<p><em>evaṁ kṛtvā japaṁ devyā vāmahaste nivedayet</em> //189//</p>
<p>The symbolical off ering of the <em>japa</em> ( <em>japanivedana</em> ) into the hand of the deity being worshipped is one of the usual actions of the <em>pūjā</em> . It is a mark of respect and devotion. The Dī , however, true to its nondualist philosophical doctrine, interprets it symbolically.</p>
<p>In this perspective, the <em>japa</em> that has just been performed is lived by the offi</p>
<p>ciating adept as bringing about a fusion with the *śrīvidyā * associated with the <em>kuṇḍalinī</em> , a power both human and cosmic-divine, and thus as having a transcendental-cosmic dimension. It is a lived experience of the resorption of the cosmos into the deity. Given in the left hand of the Goddess, the <em>japa</em> is considered as being off ered to the dissolving aspect of the deity. The Goddess holds it and reabsorbs it in herself and, with it, the <em>sādhaka</em> , who is thus symbolically liberated.</p>
<p>156
The last rites of the *pūjā * are now to be performed; fi rst, the ritual libation, <em>tarpaṇa</em> :</p>
<p>With the joined thumb and ring fi nger, he must satiate the deities of the <em>cakra</em> .</p>
<p>*anāmāṅguṣṭhayogena tarpayec cakradevatā ḥ * /</p>
<p>The joined thumb and ring fi nger symbolize the union of Śiva (thumb) and Śakti (ring fi nger). The off ering is to be done to all the deities of the <em>cakra</em> . How it is done, and with what consecrated water, is not said. The Dī</p>
<p>gives a metaphysical interpretation of this rite</p>
<p>The oblation to the Goddess follows:</p>
<p>He will off er to the Goddess wine, meat, and fi sh. //190//</p>
<p><em>madyaṁ māṁsaṁ tathā matsyaṁ devyai tu vinivedayet</em> //190//</p>
<p>Those are usual Tantric off erings. No sexual practice is prescribed here, as is, however, sometimes the case in the tradition of Tripurā. 60</p>
<p>He will worship her in the company of heroes devoted to the practices of Kula.</p>
<p><em>kaulācārasamāyuktair vīrais tu saha pūjayet</em> /</p>
<p>There is no indication that this <em>pūjā</em> is a collective worship. It is called *cakrapūjā * because it is done with the <em>śrīcakra</em> , not because worshippers are placed in circles. We may therefore believe that this prescription aims merely at excluding the presence of noninitiates: the Dī says it excludes those who are not perfected ( <em>siddha</em> ).</p>
<p>The <em>cakrapūjā</em> of the Yoginīs is to be performed in a special manner under the constellations of <em>puṣya</em> , when the sun is dominant, O Parameśvarī! //191// on the birthday of the <em>guru</em> , on that of one’s own constellation, and also on the eighth and fourteenth lunar days.</p>
<p>//192//</p>

<p>“In a special manner” ( <em>viṣeśena</em> ) is to be understood (says the Dī ) as using the sort of “occasional [ <em>naimittika</em> ] rites that would satisfy the group of sixty-four, or other categories of, Yoginīs.” This precision is not useless, since the part of the *pūjā * performed in the nine <em>cakras</em> of the <em>śrīcakra</em> was to be done using “optional” ( <em>kāmya</em> ) rites; see *śl. * 166. 61</p>
<p><em>Puṣya</em> is the sixth or seventh lunar day. The day when the sun is dominant would now be Sunday (sun-day).</p>
<p>Since sixty-four crores of very powerful Yoginīs are assembled in this <em>cakra</em> , O Beloved of the Heroes! //193// [their worship] is to be performed eight times eight times, without cheating on the</p>
<p>expenses.</p>
<p><em>catu ḥṣaṣṭir yata ḥ koṭyo yoginīnāṁ mahaujasām</em> /</p>
<p><em>cakram etat samāśritya saṁsthitā vīravandite</em> //193//</p>
<p><em>aṣṭāṣṭakaṁ tu kartavyaṁ vittiśāṭhyavivarjitam</em> /</p>
<p>A usual number of Yoginīs is sixty-four. From each of these sixty-four, a crore (ten million) emanate. Surely, they are merely to be mentally evoked, even if imagined as crowding the <em>śrīcakra</em> . No indication is given about when and how these sixty-four <em>pūjās</em> are to be performed.</p>
<p>The rule to act without cheating, without limiting the expenses, is a generally valid principle, already alluded to in the fourth stanza of the fi rst chapter of the YH. Hindu ritual works on a <em>do ut des</em> principle: one cannot expect the deity’s favor or generosity if one does not worship with generosity.</p>
<p>[But] you alone it is, Enchantress of the Worlds, who are playing under the guise of these [deities]!</p>
<p><em>tvam eva tāsāṁ rūpeṇa krīḍase viśvamohinī</em> //194//</p>
<p>As a consequence of this, says the Dī , when one worships all these deities who are but fragments of the Goddess, it is in reality the supreme Goddess who is worshipped.</p>
<p>Who, not knowing the doctrine and practices of Kula or paying</p>
<p>respect to the sandals of the guru, penetrates in this doctrine, you will assuredly punish him. //195//</p>
<p><em>ajṇātvā tu kulācāram ayaṣṭvā gurupādukām</em> /</p>
<p><em>yo ‘smin śāstre parvarteta taṁ tvaṁ pīḍayasi dhruvam</em> //195//</p>
<p>158
The YH repeats the rule already given in the fi rst chapter that only adepts initiated by a guru of the sect and following its rules of behavior are permitted to study and try to follow its doctrine and practices. The eff orts of the uninitiated are necessarily fruitless.</p>
<p>O Woman of beautiful hips! [the adept] who has thus learned,</p>
<p>who follows ceaselessly the rules and behavior of the Kula, having off ered us wine and meat changed into something else, //196//</p>
<p>must consider carefully the forms of the flow of your expansion which is [in fact] none but You.</p>
<p>*evaṁ jñātvā varārohe kaulācārapara ḥ sadā * /</p>
<p><em>āvayo ḥ śabalākāraṁ madyaṁ māṁsaṁ nivedya ca</em> //196//</p>
<p><em>tvatprathāprasarākāras tvām eva paribhāvayet</em> /</p>
<p>The forms taken by the expanding flow of the Goddess are the deities that surround her (the <em>āvaraṇadevatā</em> ), whose forms, the Dī says, are born from her and who therefore are to be considered as mere forms taken by her: “They are fi gures born from the playful shining forth [ <em>vilāsa</em> ] of the energy of free consciousness [ <em>vimarśaśakti</em> ] which are to be seen and meditated as being none other than you.”</p>
<p>The off erings of alcohol and pieces of meat are “changed into something else,” since they are believed to be transformed into ambrosia by the ritual of off ering. The Dī quotes here a saying: “Wine is Śiva, meat is Śakti; bliss is said to be liberation.”</p>
<p>You, Goddess who takes on the form you desire, are to be perceived under the aspect of the spiritual master. //197// Having made an off ering to the master who is no other than yourself, [the adept]</p>
<p>must unite with himself what remains of it.</p>
<p><em>tvām icchāvigrahāṁ devīṁ gururūpāṁ vibhāvayet</em> //197//</p>
<p><em>tvanmayasya guro ḥ śeṣaṁ nivedyātmani yojayet</em> /</p>
<p>It seems best here to quote all of Amṛtānanda’s commentary:</p>
<p>The Goddess is embodied in all forms that exist [ <em>viśvarūpa</em> ]. Wishing to spread her grace on the universe, she takes on forms by play</p>
<p>[ <em>līlā</em> ]. She assumes thus the form she desires. You only are to be perceived under the aspect of the guru. To this master “who is no</p>

<p>*Encounter in the Worship *</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>other than yourself,” who has your nature [ <em>tvadrūpa</em> ], one must have off ered “cause (= wine); then the <em>sādhaka</em> will unite with himself this off ering: what remains, that is, of what he fi rst off ered to the deity and to the master. Which is to say that the <em>sādhaka</em> , insofar as he has absorbed this remain, will be united, fused [ <em>samarasībhavati</em> ]</p>
<p>with the one and the other.</p>
<p>O Great Goddess! the <em>bali</em> is to be off ered, using “cause,” to myself who am the Guardian of the Field and to Baṭuka who is the self of the Yoginīs. //198b–199a//</p>
<p><em>yoginīnāṁ mahādevi baṭukāyātmarūpiṇe</em> //198//</p>
<p>*kṣetrāṇāṁ pataye mahyaṁ baliṁ kurvīta hetunā * /</p>
<p>The rite of <em>bali</em> is one of the last parts of the *pūjā. * It is given here a metaphysical dimension underscored in the Dī , which says that the inner nature of Baṭuka is the vibration ( <em>spanda</em> ) of the supreme bliss, which is the self of the Yoginīs.</p>
<p>As for Kṣetrapāla, the “Guardian of the (sacrifi cial) Field,” the “fi eld,”</p>
<p>it says, is the body. It is, therefore, in the mind ( <em>manasi</em> ) to the guardian of the body and in reality to Bhairava that the <em>bali</em> is given. The Dī concludes: “It is by appeasing the movement of the <em>prāṇa</em> and <em>apāna</em> breaths</p>
<p>and by annihilating the threefold 62 diff erentiation, and with the thought ‘I am Śiva,’ that one off ers the inner <em>bali</em> .”</p>
<p>Divinized by the <em>pūjā</em> , the <em>sādhaka</em> may henceforth act freely: Ceaselessly drinking, devouring, and rejecting, acting on his own of his own free will, //199// realizing meditatively the unity of subject and object, the [adept] will remain in happiness.</p>
<p>*nityaṁ piban vaman khādan svvecchācārapara *</p>
<p><em>ḥ svayam</em> //199//</p>
<p><em>ahantedantayor aikyaṁ bhāvayan viharet sukham</em> /</p>
<p>This drinking, devouring, and rejecting may be taken literally as referring to daily life. The Dī , however, understands it as drinking and eating the ritual off erings while rejecting them mentally.</p>
<p>Acting of one’s own free will is explained as considering that whatever the <em>sādhaka</em> wishes, he must consider permitted. To realize the unity of I ( <em>ahanta</em> , I-ness) and this ( <em>idantā</em> , objectivity) is to realize the truth of nonduality.</p>
<p>Amṛtānanda quotes a stanza of the <em>Vijñānabhairava</em> which we may attempt to render as follows: “Because of the blossoming of the bliss</p>
<p>160
arising from the pleasure of eating and drinking, one is to fuse mentally with the perfection of this joy; one will then identify with the supreme bliss.”</p>
<p>The YH concludes the <em>pūjāsaṁketa</em> , saying:</p>
<p>This divine and excellent threefold practice has been told to you.</p>
<p>//200//</p>
<p>It is to be kept carefully hidden, as one does one’s secret parts, O Dear One! Neither to a frivolous being nor to one who merely</p>
<p>desires knowledge is it to be revealed, O Perfect One. //201// One must not, in contradiction to the rules, entrust it to unbelievers, O Maheśvarī!</p>
<p><em>etat te kathitaṁ divyaṁ saṁketatrayam uttamam</em> //200//</p>
<p><em>gopanīyaṁ prayatnena svaguhyam iva suvrate</em> /</p>
<p><em>cumbake jñānalubdhe ca na prakāśyaṁ tvayānaghe</em> //201//</p>
<p><em>anyāyena na dātavyaṁ nāstikāṇāṁ maheśvari</em> /</p>
<p>This prescription was already formulated in the fi rst chapter, 1.4.</p>
<p>I am thus ordered by You who are the form taken by my own will, O Mistress! //202//</p>
<p><em>evaṁ tvayāham ājñapto madicchārūpayā prabho</em> //202//</p>
<p>Bhairava, the supreme God, a form of Śiva, appears here as both dominant, since the Goddess is the form taken by his will, and subordinated, since he is ordered by the Goddess to question her. We may see this as expressing the contradiction between the metaphysical principle that the supreme transcending reality is the male Śiva and the fact that theologically, the Goddess, Śakti, is the supreme deity. She is supreme, but Śiva is metaphysically above her. We must not forget that the Tantras were composed by men.</p>
<p>Who will give [this teaching] contrary to the rules will surely perish.</p>
<p>Who understands [this] practice will become dear to the Yoginīs.</p>

<p>The Yoginīs, “rays of light of the supreme Consciousness,” says the Dī , have a particular connection ( <em>yoga</em> ) with the supreme Śiva, the master of all powers. The adept who follows this teaching, helped by the Yoginīs,</p>
<p>“will therefore become the supreme Śiva,” omnipotent and omniscient.</p>
<p>The statement that the adept will enjoy all the fruits he desires may come as a surprise to the reader who has seen that all the practices propounded in this Tantra were deemed to lead the adept to liberation. This, however, is normal in a Tantric context. The Tantric liberation in life <em>—</em></p>
<p>which can be reached, in principle, by using the means of this world, notably <em>kāma</em> , passion <em>—</em> gives, in fact, both <em>mukti</em> and <em>bhukti</em> , liberation and rewards. This is liberation from the fetters of this world but also magical domination over the world thanks to the possession of supernatural powers, <em>siddhi</em> s.</p>
<p>The Śrīvidyā’s initiated adept permitted to perform a</p>
<p><em>pūjā</em></p>
<p>is a</p>
<p><em>sādhaka</em> : one who possesses <em>siddhis</em> . He is usually considered a <em>bubhukṣu</em> , a being “desirous of <em>bhukti</em> ,” of worldly and otherworldly rewards, that is, rather than a <em>mumukṣu</em> , 63 a seeker of liberation. The  <em>tāntrika</em> , we might say, is not of this world but in this world, which he has not left but transcends and dominates. This is what the YH off ers.</p>
<p>The YH concludes:</p>
<p>What is visible everywhere, O Goddess, how can the sage not turn his thought toward it? //204//</p>
<p><em>yato ‘pi dṛśyate devi kathaṁ vidvān na cintayet</em> //204//</p>
<p>Śiva’s <em>—</em> or the Goddess’s <em>—</em> omnipresence is surely visible, understand-able, by the sage if he follows the YH’s teaching. Amṛtānanda concludes his commentary: “O Mother! your nature, which Śiva did not expose clearly because it is very secret, has been explained at the request of the Master” <em>—</em> that is, by the YH.</p>
<p>We hope that the reader will have found this text illuminating and that our attempt at an explanation has been useful.We would conclude in the traditional Sanskrit way <em>—</em> as Amṛtānanda has done in the Dīpikā—by saying, “be indulgent to us for that,” <em>no kṣamasva tat</em> .</p>

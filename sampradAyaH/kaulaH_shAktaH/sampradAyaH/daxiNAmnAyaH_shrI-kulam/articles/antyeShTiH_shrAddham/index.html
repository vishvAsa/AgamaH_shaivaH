Śrīvidyā Guru Antyeṣṭi Vidhi
(The final rites for a Śrīvidyā Guru or an upāsaka)
Translator&#39;s note My guru, Śrī Sathyanārāyaṇa wrote this chapter in his magnum opus book trilogy series called ‘Śrīvidyā ṣoḍaśikā’ under the publication series ‘Citkalā’, when (along with the gurukula which he founded) his _guru Śrī _Puṇḍarīkākṣānanda Nātha appeared as a spiritual vision from the Yajña kuṇḍa (a place for sacrifice, the place where the yajña is performed) with a special behest: that Sathyanārāyaṇa had to perform the proper antyeṣṭi to enable the guru to attain the divyadeha(ultimate state of existence). In order to fulfill this, Sathyanārāyaṇa had to first ascertain its modalities and hence worked perennially amongst the Śrīvidyā texts. This article is the result of that effort. He took care to not to extensively include the mention of intimate and deeply guarded ritualistic details, secrets and verses, in order to avoid them from an exposure to vulgar curiosity. However, his original kannaḍa (local vernacular of Karnāṭaka, a state in India) article includes an extensive bibliography and references with which those things can also be known. It can be provided to learned readers on request.">

<p><strong>Śrīvidyā Guru Antyeṣṭi Vidhi</strong></p>
<p>(The final rites for a Śrīvidyā Guru or an upāsaka)</p>
<details><summary>Translator's note</summary>
<p>My <em>guru</em>, Śrī Sathyanārāyaṇa wrote this chapter in his magnum opus book trilogy series called ‘<em>Śrīvidyā ṣoḍaśikā</em>’ under the publication series ‘<em>Citkalā</em>’, when (along with the <em>gurukula</em> which he founded) his _guru Śrī _Puṇḍarīkākṣānanda Nātha appeared as a spiritual vision from the <em>Yajña kuṇḍa</em> (a place for sacrifice, the place where the <em>yajña</em> is performed) with a special behest: that Sathyanārāyaṇa had to perform the proper <em>antyeṣṭi</em> to enable the <em>guru</em> to attain the <em>divyadeha</em>(ultimate state of existence). In order to fulfill this, Sathyanārāyaṇa had to first ascertain its modalities and hence worked perennially amongst the <em>Śrīvidyā</em> texts. This article is the result of that effort. He took care to not to extensively include the mention of intimate and deeply guarded ritualistic details, secrets and verses, in order to avoid them from an exposure to vulgar curiosity. However, his original <em>kannaḍa</em> (local vernacular of Karnāṭaka, a state in India) article includes an extensive bibliography and references with which those things can also be known. It can be provided to learned readers on request.</p>
<p>I have translated this article with as much due diligence as possible to not to deviate from its original intent and content. Any translation, for that matter, is indeed a literary interpretation of the original to a measurable extant.</p>
<p><em>Traduttore, traditore</em>. The grammar, individual’s language usage styles, limitations of vocabulary, terminology akin to that discipline for which the original was written etc might not accommodate in the vocabulary of translated language. Thus, the original article’s specific words and terms that contain language specific terminologies are to be given ad verbatim in the translated text too. In order to make the reading more meaningful and truthful, the specific terminologies (<em>paribhāṣa</em>) are explained to their nearest context just next to them with in-brackets. The original article contains many such specific <em>Tantra</em> terminologies (<em>paribhāṣā</em>). In each of these paragraphs, many are very explicit in their meaning and content but some require basic geo-specific and subject-specific information regarding its tradition and rituals pertaining to tantric tenets. It is my intention to create a separate addendum for this article to explain them in some measurable detail. Such terms and phrases are marked with a ‘symbol with number’ for their correlation in the addendum. However, their inclusion in the article while in those phrases or terms would deviate the continuity in the attentive focus of the readers, is what I have felt and noticed from my many interactions with my readers. Hence, I request that the addendum be also carefully read and referred to by the learned readers of this article to make a holistic meaning and use (if any) of this article.</p>

<p>The word <em>antyeṣṭi</em> is used as a Vedic or Tantric terminology to describe a gamut of actions comprising of the final rites of a person after his death. These rites are done to the cadaver of such a person. Its foremost and key action is done in either of these two modes: to bury or burn in Bhārata amongst the Hindūs (In India, the other religious beliefs accommodate the offer of the body to be consumed by birds, animals or fish (as is done in places like Vāraṇāsi). The ways of the Hindūs are based on the tenet prescription that what came from the <em>pañcabhūtās</em> should be rendered back to it, and the other cultures offer it as food for other bodies (and thus the parts that sustained a life force is rendered back to other living bodies as food thus fulfilling the purpose and attainment of the body while living). Each and every culture of our world has devised its own type/s of such eschatology practice descriptions codified as a text and in Bhārata it is given a <em>saṃskṛta</em> term ‘<em>pretaśāstra</em>’. Amongst Hindūs, the burying of the body is called as <em>khanana</em> and burning is called as <em>dahana</em>. Before all these, an iṣṭi (a small homa offering) is performed. And using the fire that has kindled in this <em>homa</em>, the body is placed on a pyre and the wood is set to fire. This entails various <em>mantras</em> and actions that bespeaks the offering of the cadaver to release the <em>jīva</em> (life) that had made the body as its abode to reach the <em>Devaloka</em> or the <em>Pitr̥loka</em> (the realms of the <em>pitr̥</em>). This begins the ‘<em>antyeṣṭi</em>’ mode and thus the entire gamut of actions that follow it takes on this term too. The word <em>antyeṣṭi</em> is a composite of two words: <em>antya</em> (the final) and <em>iṣṭi</em> (offering). Great seers like Bodhāyana and the other two <em>ācāryas</em> who have set the <em>sūtras</em> (prescriptive doctrines) have said that <em>antyeṣṭi</em> is primarily done for <em>Brāhmaṇa varga</em> (the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> clan) and for other three vargas (<em>kṣatriya</em>,_ vaiśya <em>and</em> śūdra _clans) it is done in their <em>kulakrama</em> (the basic _antyeṣṭi vidhi _adopted to their kin group’s vogue practices). For <em>saṃnyāsin</em>, there is a separate and different type that is prescribed in the <em>sūtras</em>. (I have covered all these in another work of mine in <em>kannaḍa</em> language published some time ago).</p>
<p>In <em>Śrīvidyā Tantra</em> too, extensive <em>antyeṣṭi vidhi</em> is prescribed for its <em>dīkṣitās</em> (persons initiated by their guru into its <em>sādhanā</em>) and also for those a special initiation ritual called <em>pūrṇābhiṣekha</em> is done. Amongst the <em>Śrīvidyā</em> texts that I have browsed, this vidhi is delineated in <em>Trikūṭārahasya</em> and _Paraśurāma Kalpasūtra _with some narrative and prescriptive differences amongst them.</p>
<p>Based on these two texts, I narrate henceforth the <em>vidhi</em> of <em>antyeṣṭi</em> for <em>Śrīvidyā dīkṣitas <em>and</em> Śrividyā abhiṣikta sādhakas</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>Śaivāgama</em>, the <em>dīkṣita</em>,_ siddha <em>and</em> Śrīvidyā sādhakas_ are further respectively classified within them as <em>uttama</em> (superior), <em>madhyama</em> (the average) and the <em>adhama</em> (lowly). Interestingly, this classification is done based also on the modality in which the <em>prāṇa</em> (life-force) leaves the body of the <em>upāsaka</em>. In _uttama varga <em>(superior</em> sādhaka _group), who would have already attained a very high level of <em>ātmadarśana</em> (self-emancipation), a ritualistic <em>antyeṣṭi</em> is not necessary. Thus, in contrast, for the <em>adhamas</em> who are filled with _pāpa sañcaya <em>(sinful, collected to its threshold etc.) an <em>antyeṣṭi</em> is not prescribed. <em>Ūttama</em>’s</em> prāṇa _leaves the body through the <em>brahmarandhra</em> (the tip of the scalp). For the <em>madhyama</em>, it leaves through the eyes, nose etc. and for the <em>adhama</em> it leaves through the genitals or the anus. The texts further goes on to say that for all those whose <em>prāṇa</em> leaves via the nose, genitals or the anus, the <em>jīva</em> attains the hell or the intermediary <em>piśācā</em> abode. When the <em>jīva</em> exits the body through mouth, he reaches, <em>daitya loka</em> (here <em>daitya</em> also means a voluptuous space), if it exits through ears, the <em>jīva</em> attains the <em>Pitr̥loka</em> (the abode of <em>pitr̥s</em>, the ancestor’s holy place), and if it exits through the <em>brahmarandhra</em> (<em>brahma</em> = the superior/ultimate, <em>randhra</em>= passage) the <em>jīva</em> attains <em>mokṣa</em> or the <em>Śivasthāna</em> (ultimate propitious state).</p>
<p><em>Śrī guru</em>, the preceptor of the <em>Śrīvidyā kula</em> (<em>kula</em> = clan, family, group etc.), or his <em>dīkṣita śiṣya</em> (properly initiated disciple), when expires, his <em>antyeṣṭi</em> need to be done by first noticing how the <em>prāṇa</em> exits the body. First, the day of death (according to the <em>pañcāṅga</em>, the traditional almanac) is ascertained. The minor details of the <em>antyeṣṭi</em> are fine-tuned based on this factor. The cadaver of the <em>guru</em> or the <em>sādhaka</em> is placed in <em>yogāsana</em> posture on <em>darbha</em> (or <em>kuśa</em> grass) woven into a mat. The <em>kartr̥</em> (one who takes on the responsibility of doing the <em>antyeṣṭi</em>) propitiates Bhairava and Yoginī <em>devatās</em> by prescribed <em>arcana</em> (specialized ritualistic) <em>vidhi</em>. Then, <em>puśpāñjali</em> (flowers and garlands) is offered to the <em>Guru/sādhaka</em> with this <em>prārthanā</em> (prayer): O superior spirit (Deva), Mahādeva, most compassionate, bestowed of benefice (<em>śaṃkara</em>), perennially blissful (<em>nityānanda</em>), n_irādhāra nirākula_ (one who has exalted to a ‘no adherence to mundane’ state of existence), and <em>nirañjana</em> (blissful), all that is beneficial happens at your behest. Yet, o Śiva, <em>sarvajñya</em> (knower of all), Parameśvara (ultimate being), kindly condone me should I have done anything wrong in the past. Thou my <em>guru</em> and imperishable, I am your devotee and disciple and thus empower me to accomplish further <em>vidhi</em>. I shall use only my true virtues, monies and such worldly tools to do your <em>antyeṣṭi</em> using the <em>divyāgama</em> (meaning the most propitious of all <em>Agamas</em>, the <em>śāktāgama</em> texts and practices). Thus saying the <em>kartr̥</em> then prostrates in multifold (again and again) before the <em>Guru/sādhaka</em> in the <em>darbhāsana</em> posture.</p>
<p>He then keeps the <em>gurupāduka</em> (specially made out sandals of the <em>guru</em> either in wood or metal and which is etched with special symbols and <em>mantra</em> verses) on the <em>gurupīṭha</em> (the seat used by the <em>Guru</em> or the <em>sādhaka</em> during their <em>sādhanā</em>) to do a special <em>pūjā</em> ritual, if such is not possible at that time, then he take a special vow to do it in the proceeding corresponding day. The <em>kartr̥</em> then puts together all the worldly remains of the diseased and makes four parts. Out of this, two parts of these goes to the son (or the next in line incumbent), one part goes as <em>dāna</em> to a pious person of the same <em>gotra</em> (roughly translated as ‘tribesman’), and the remaining one part is fully utilized as expenditure incurred for the <em>antyeṣṭi</em> rituals. Such rituals would usually start from the third, fifth or the seventh day reckoned from the day of death (as per the traditional almanac).</p>
<p>The texts (<em>Kalpasūtras</em>) also provide very interesting insights of the event. If the <em>Guru</em> or the <em>sādhaka</em> is in his ultimate throes of death, but not expired yet, a special ritualistic <em>Śricakra pūjā</em> is to be done. The <em>kartr̥</em> then goes to the about to expire <em>sādhaka</em> and utters the <em>gurupādukā mantra</em>,_ caraṇatraya mantra_,_ vidyādvaya mantra_, various <em>sampradāya mantra <em>that the <em>upāsaka</em> practiced in his life (according to his <em>kula</em> practices), general <em>kaula</em> practices and their <em>mantras</em> (rituals and verses that are common to the area), <em>kulakramānugata mantra</em> (traditionally handed over secretive <em>mantras</em>),</em> kādi-hādi-sādi mārga mantras</em> (the trifold layers or levels in a <em>Śrīvidyā</em> practice) are then essentially uttered (<em>japa vidhāna</em>). While all these are happening before the <em>Guru</em> or the <em>sādhaka</em> in their death bed/seat, their <em>citta</em>, the inner essential core being gets focused. And then the <em>kartr̥</em> has to do a very essential ritual: he recites the <em>purāṇa mantra <em>(in the <em>Śivapurāna</em> yore, it is said that the great king Bhūtirāja obtained <em>mantras</em> from Śiva to attain his <em>mokṣa</em>),</em> bramavidyā mantra</em> (only the <em>vākya</em> verses) are recited by inserting the <em>Oṃ praṇava</em> in-between the <em>vākya</em> of the verses. He then ritualistically organizes the essential items used for the <em>antyeṣṭi</em> rituals using the <em>mantras</em> as prescribed in the <em>Kalpasūtrā</em>. The <em>kartr̥</em> now recites the ultimate _haṃsa mantra _(<em>Oṃ haṃsaḥ</em>) in the ears of the dying (or the dead) <em>Guru</em> or the <em>sādhaka</em>. By this, the <em>jīva</em>, now rises above the mortal body and reaches the Parabrahman state, the ultimate <em>mokṣa</em>.</p>
<p>Now, the Brahmavidya is narrated thus. This is a bestowed of absolute and full benefit. Śiva himself has taught this to the <em>Śrīvidyā dīkṣitas</em> for their final emancipation. The lord has ordained that the very recitation of this will surely bestow the <em>mokṣa</em> (<em>nirañjanatva</em>) to all living beings. Even a casual hearing of these <em>mantras</em> would relieve the <em>jīva</em> of all <em>moha</em> (stupefaction) and <em>māyā</em> (illusionary world/knowledge/creatrix) and ushers the <em>sādhaka</em> into the real knowledge. This is further segmented into <em>naromāya</em>,_ vedamāya_,_ vedakalā_, one’s own <em>mātr̥kāyoni</em> (the secretive <em>mātr̥kā</em> vowel given by the <em>Guru</em> during the <em>dīkṣā</em>) are then used before and after each line of the verses of this <em>mantra</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Oṃ hrīm hasakḥphreṃ aṃ hasakṣamalavarayūṃ: this is the niṣkalābrahmavidyā</em>. This <em>mantra</em> is to be uttered before and after each of the following lines.</li>

O <em>vibho</em>, you now do the kindness of elevating this soul by integrating the <em>śakti</em> which resides in the navel region to rise towards the head (Sadāśiva <em>sarga</em>), thus relieving this soul (<em>prabodha</em>) from the <em>māyādeha</em> (the illusory body) with is filled with (<em>viniveṣaḥ</em>)_ kāmalobha _(the five sins that bid the pure soul to the mortal body). (this <em>mantra</em> and its concept further dwell on the <em>āyurveda</em> tenet that at the time of death, the <em>tridośa</em> merges completely to nullify the <em>prāṇa</em>. Here the prayer is to elevate the Śakti towards the Śiva which in turn makes the <em>prāṇa</em> leave the mortal remains without any deformity)</li>

<li>_Brahmavidyā jñānī svayamevāsūnniyasya prajapettadā anyatha śr̥uṇuyādvāpi tadaikāgramanāḥ bhavet _(those who meditate continuously upon these <em>Brahmavidyā</em> verses help to attain the oneness with the ultimate, barring which, if one even hears this attains the essential focused mind to pave the way towards the divinity. Thus, one who practices this <em>nirvāṇavidyā</em> attains the <em>nirvāṇāpada</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>kartr̥</em> who takes on the responsibility of doing the <em>antyeṣṭi</em> should ritualistically obtain the <em>Śivāmśa</em> (and in Śiva_ bhāva_ = unbridled but devoted mind) should do the <em>snāna</em> (take the holy bath), should wear the ritualistic cloth and such ornamentation, finish his daily rituals like <em>nityāhnīka</em>. He then sits before the cadaver with settled mind and peace. He performs the ritualistic <em>aṅganyāsa</em> (anointment of the various parts of his body with <em>mantras</em>). He installs the <em>śrī kalaśa</em> which is filled with holy water. He cleanses the <em>pinḍa</em> (the cadaver) of the <em>guru</em> or <em>sādhaka</em> with the <em>mantra</em> given by his (<em>Śrīvidyā</em>)_ Guru <em>and the <em>ratnapañcaka</em> (<em>pañcabhūta mantra</em>) or <em>dīpani mantra</em>. And then, he recites the</em> jvālāmālinī mantra_,_ vyoma mantra_ in its sixth tenor, the (<em>Śrīvidyā</em>)_ astra mantra_ (armament <em>mantra</em>) and <em>māyābīja</em> (a secretive vowel given by the <em>Guru</em> during <em>dīkṣākrama</em>).</p>
<p>This is the <em>dīpani mantra</em>:</p>
<p><em>Oṃ hrīṃ hasakhphreṃ aṃ hasakṣamalavarayūṃ aiṃ dīpani jvālāmālini hūṃ haṃsaḥ phaṭ hrīṃ hasakphreṃmalavaraūṃ aṃ hasakhphreṃ hrīṃ Oṃ</em>.</p>
<p>Thus reciting this <em>mantra</em>, holding once to show the <em>śakticālana</em> (<em>mudrā</em>), the cadaver is washed again (with ghee or water) and then as per the vedic and colloquial practice, the departed <em>prāṇa</em> is again ritualistically consecrated into the cadaver through eyes, and other <em>navarandhra</em> (the nine outlet-inlets of the body). The <em>kartr̥</em> then seeks the blessings of the <em>Guru</em> by suitable verses and prayer to recite and use <em>mantras</em> that empower the attraction of <em>ākāśa</em>,_ agnibīja_, bestower of <em>mokṣa</em> (all these have <em>bindu</em> at the end, for without the <em>bindu</em>, the <em>mantras</em> are powerless). These are again recited with vedic <em>mantras</em> that start from <em>cakṣu</em> at its end along with the <em>pretanāma</em>, the various ascribed nomenclature of the <em>preta</em> (the departed spirit).</p>
<p>Using this <em>mantra</em>, again, <em>proṃ mokṣe devasurādi pade deva devānāmāvāhayāmi</em>, and joining this with the five <em>Śrīvidyā praṇava</em> (there are five equivalents to the vedic <em>Oṃ</em> in <em>Tantra</em>), the <em>preta</em> is invited into the cadaver again for further rituals. <em>preta sarvādibhyo nirākulam</em>,_ amuṣyotpādi <em>etc.</em> mantras _are now used to re-invite the <em>prāṇa vāyu</em> (life breath), to do <em>aṅgasaṃkalpa</em> (to do <em>bhāvana</em> of the various limbs of the mortal remains) and this <em>mantra</em> is used in conjunction with six <em>bījas</em> starting from <em>hrāṃ</em>. Now a raw cotton thread is wound around the remains and the <em>prānapratiṣṭha</em> (reinstallation of the <em>prāṇa</em>) is performed. From then on, the vedic rituals take over to do the <em>deha saṃskāra</em> (the ritualistic embalming of the remains). Thus the entire remains now become <em>astirūpa vardhinī</em> body (the skeleton of the mortal remains now acquires the name <em>vardhinī</em>). This is propitiated with <em>abhiṣeka</em> with the holy water from the <em>kalaśa</em>.</p>
<p>The next process involves the anointment of the mortal remains with <em>bhasma</em>, the holy ash while praying for the <em>parameṣṭhiguru</em> or <em>brahman</em>. The <em>kuśa</em> grass is spread on the ground and the corpse is places with its head towards the South. It is decorated with various flowers and jewels too. A new cloth is wound around its neck (<em>tad galepyaiḥ</em>). Entire body is now covered with <em>nyāsa</em> ritual wherein the <em>Guru/sādhaka</em>’s primary <em>mūlamantra upāsana nyāsa mantras</em> and <em>bījamantras</em> are used. The <em>gurupāduka</em> is now placed on the right side of the body on the <em>darbha</em> (<em>kuśa</em>) bed. Its <em>pūjā</em> and <em>udvāsana</em> are done. A <em>vimāna</em> for the mortal remains (<em>śavavāhana</em> = a raw palanquin) is now created according to the limb configurations of the body. The body is now kept on this <em>vimāna</em> to be taken for a procession in the area en-route to the burial ground wherein instruments like <em>śaṅkha</em> (conch) and <em>bherī</em> (big diameter-skin) drums are played.</p>
<p>In the burning grounds a plain area is now selected and such a place is cleaned and kept dry. On this, <em>akṣata</em> (holy rice), <em>aral̥u</em> (puffed rice), <em>til</em> seeds are strewn. On this ground, a <em>nityāgni</em> (everyday ritualistic fire) is lit up. A <em>paristaraṇa</em> (bundles of <em>kuśa</em> long grass is kept around the making a square) is done in an anti-clock wise and on this the vessels for the rituals are placed. Towards the south, a <em>praṇītā</em> vessel is kept invoking Viṣṇu and this is decorated with flowers and <em>akṣata</em> rice. This vessel is then covered with <em>darbha</em> grass and taken to the south-east corner of the <em>paristaraṇa</em>. In the southern part of the <em>paristaraṇa</em>, a Bhairava <em>maṇḍala</em> is drawn and its <em>pūjā</em> is performed. In one of its ends, an <em>agnimukha</em>, featuring the tongue of agni fire, is drawn. A <em>caru</em> consisting of til seeds and rice is now mixed in an adequate quantity. <em>Agni</em> is now fired up again in the <em>nityāgni</em> portion and this <em>caru</em>, along with cow’s ghee is used while chanting <em>mr̥tyunjaya mantra</em> along with five <em>mantras</em> taken from ‘<em>sadyojātādi rudra nyāsa</em>’, a <em>homa</em> is performed before the corpse. In-between these, the <em>Śrīvidyā mūlamantra <em>(the</em> mantra <em>of</em> upāsana/upāsaka</em>) is chanted seven times in a _viloma krama _(reverse order). This is the _viloma krama homa _which is indeed specific for this most important ritual. These <em>mantras</em> in <em>viloma</em> is again used to do <em>nyāsa</em> on the remains of the <em>guru/sādhaka/upāsaka</em> to redirect the <em>jīva</em> to become one with <em>puryaṣṭaka</em> (Sūrya the sun, Candra the moon, <em>pañcabhūta,</em> the five elements and <em>cetana/puruṣa</em> the spirit).</p>
<p><em>Aiṃ</em> is the <em>vāgbhava bīja</em>. This is used as an end adjunct to the <em>mūlamantra</em> practiced by the departed and a <em>homa</em> is done. If this order is clockwise then it is for the <em>gṛhastha</em> and if in anticlockwise, then it is for the <em>saṃnyāsin</em>. But then, the <em>jīva</em> is still in its <em>sūkṣmatatva</em> (subtle body). For this, special ritualistic <em>mantras</em> that involve this <em>tatva</em> are used in <em>viloma</em> rounds to garner all that now remains of the <em>jīva</em> to reunite it with <em>ātman</em>. But then, even now, the subtle body is believed to be in an anxious state of existence. For this, another homa using the <em>puṇya pāpa bhaya bhakṣiṇī</em> variety is employed to ward off all impediments to attain the final emancipation.</p>
<p>This variety includes the following <em>mantras</em> and rituals: _khaṭakasakharayūṃ phuṃ phaṭ | śiśokhañga puṇyapāpamāsā nāsayāmi svāhā | _using this <em>sthala krama homa</em> is performed which enables the subtle body to attain <em>ātman</em>. The various rituals in this method progressively involve the merging of the delicate <em>jīva</em> with its higher but powerful pinpointed existential states. In its penultimate practice, the <em>jīva</em> now acquires the state of <em>bindu</em> point which empowers it to get rid of all worldly pollutants and weaknesses. The finale called the <em>pūrṇāhuti</em> is done to empower the spirit to attain the <em>paramapada mokṣa</em>. Thus, the <em>guru, upāsaka/sādhaka</em> now attains the purest form of bliss called <em>Śivaśaktyātmaka śuddha tattva</em>. Thus the vicious cycle of birth-death-rebirth becomes null and void.</p>
<p>Now then, the mortal remains are prepared for ritualistic burning.</p>
<p>In <em>Śrīvidyā tantra</em>, this last part of the funeral ceremony involves a lot of <em>bhāvana upāsana</em>. A <em>homa</em> offering is done with five <em>mantras</em> of <em>aghora</em> etc. with a <em>bhāvana</em> that the dead one shall reach <em>Śivasthāna</em>, (the state that has ensconced the thirty-three <em>tattvas</em>) the ultimate <em>mokṣa</em>. Another corpse bed is constructed using <em>darbha</em> grass, <em>bilva</em> tree sticks and the branches spreading towards the southern direction by <em>kulavr̥kśās</em> (they are: <em>śleṣmātaka</em> (<em>Cordia Dichotoma</em>),_ karnjākṣa <em>(<em>Pongamia Glavri</em>),</em> akṣa <em>(<em>Terminalia Bellirica</em>),</em> nimba <em>(<em>Azadiracta Indica</em>),</em> aśvattha_ (<em>Ficus Religiosa</em>),_ kadamba <em>(<em>Neolamarckia Cadamba</em>),</em> bilva <em>(<em>Aegle Marmelos</em>),</em> vaṭa <em>(<em>Banyan</em> tree i.e. <em>Ficus Benghalensis</em>),</em> udumbara <em>(<em>Ficus Racemosa</em>),</em> tintiṇī <em>(<em>Tamarindus Indica</em>)). This bed for the corpse is tied down with a cotton (three or nine) threaded string, the bed is then anointed with traditional herbal perfumes and the body is covered with new cloth. On this <em>śayana</em> (bed), a <em>maṇḍala</em> designed with <em>padma</em>,</em> trikoṇa_,_ ṣaṭkoṇa_,_ karṇikā_, eight petal <em>kamala</em> and upward lines are drawn and on that fresh flowers are strewn. On this, the body now is placed with its head facing the South direction, taking care that the head appears clearly. Now, this body is again sprinkled while chanting <em>rakṣaṇā mantra</em>. After this, with the chanting of <em>jvālāmālinī mantra</em>, the pyre is ceremoniously lit with the <em>mantra</em> starting with <em>daha</em> word. While the pyre is stably lit, the chanting continues with <em>aghora</em> and <em>pāśupata mantras</em>. This is the ultimate <em>homa</em> that any human can perform and hence this <em>homa</em> shall continue until the entire body is completely burnt to ashes. While the <em>kartr̥</em> is performing all these, the dead person’s relatives and belonging to same <em>gotra</em> (clan) would also join in doing <em>stotras</em> and <em>mantras</em> of their choice. The <em>Kalpasūtras</em> describe this momentous event that while the body is burning, the <em>yogigaṇa</em> assemble therein and with <em>vibhāvana</em> they ‘eat away’ the mortal remains. The <em>kartr̥</em>, while performing this ultimate <em>homa</em> (<em>citāgni</em>) does the <em>bhāvana</em> while chanting these verses from the <em>Kalpasūtrās</em>. While the last bit of the pyre is burning, the <em>kartr̥</em> sits beside the <em>maṇḍala</em> to do the <em>japa</em> of two <em>mūlamantra</em> of <em>Śrīvidyā</em> as given by the divine <em>Guru</em>. At the very end, the <em>kartr̥</em> does a <em>pūjā</em> that is specific to his <em>kula</em> or area. It is his ardent duty to guard the complete burning process and also the collection of the ashes from the pyre.</p>
<p>On the third, fifth or the seventh day, the <em>kartr̥</em> revisits the <em>citāgni</em> place and ascertains that the pyre has completely subsided. He then starts collecting the ashes from the leg side of the pyre and collects everything to store it in a new earthen pot. This pot head it tied with new cloth and is kept under a platform (<em>pīṭha</em>) in any one of these places convenient to him on the occasion: banks of a river, a clean water pond, nearby a temple, one’s own home surrounding etc. Around this <em>pīṭha</em>, three <em>mekhalās</em> (steps/stratum) are constructed. On this, the departed <em>guru</em>’s/<em>sādhaka</em>’s disciple or devotee shall perform _gurumaṇḍala pūjā _three times a day until the 11th day. On the 11th day a procession (<em>utsava</em>) is taken out to commemorate the life and achievements of the dear departed. Towards the end of this procession, a pot full of water (<em>kalaśa</em>) and adequate <em>dakṣiṇā</em> is given (<em>dāna</em>) to a very pious and pure hearted person (preferably a <em>samayī</em> or <em>Śrīvidyā upāsaka</em>). From then on the <em>kartr̥</em> shall compute the <em>ūṇa</em> and <em>māsika</em> ritual days based on accepted almanac and the _gurumaṇḍala pūjā _is performed. This shall happen for one full year. At the end of this year (<em>vārśika</em>) another ceremonious occasion is conducted and the buried earthen pot is extricated out of the three <em>mekhala</em>. This pot is then taken to a river tertiary (where its flow reaches the sea or ocean) and there on the banks the pot is finally laid to rest. Around this place, <em>kulavr̥kṣas</em> are planted, <em>gurupratimā</em> or <em>gurupādukā</em> are then carved out of stones or wood and is installed near this resting place on a very auspicious day. Should the <em>kartr̥</em> be fortunate to meet adepts in _kulāgama pāśupatamārga _persons or <em>sādhakas</em> in <em>vāmamārga</em> (eschatology), then he shall collect fifty darbha grass, spread them on the ground, the departed <em>preta</em> is then invited back onto the <em>darbha</em> grass bed and an important <em>kaula</em> ritual is conducted. After this, the <em>preta</em> shall acquire the Śambhu <em>bhāva</em>.</p>
<p>The all pious <em>Guru</em>, in his immeasurable compassion may teach all these to his devoted disciples. He may even help conduct such worthy event with the help of such disciples for the final emancipation of any true <em>sādhaka</em> or his own <em>śiṣya</em> on the last throes of his life. The <em>Kalpasūtras</em> prescribe a very interesting ritual for this event. A beautiful and well-proportioned doll is prepared with rice floor. Into this doll, the <em>ātman</em> of the near departing is drawn in (<em>ākarṣaṇa</em>). This is considered as the <em>pinḍa</em> of that person. For this <em>pinḍa</em>, all the above rituals are performed in their order. After all these actions, this <em>pinḍa</em> is kept on a <em>parākrama</em> (<em>gurupāduka</em> is also called as <em>parākrama</em>). After this the disciples and devotees shall offer separate <em>pinḍas</em> made out of rice floor to the <em>pinḍa</em> kept on the <em>gurupāduka</em> while chanting the five <em>praṇava</em> of <em>Śrividyā tantra</em>. After this, they shall offer <em>pūrṇāhuti</em>.</p>
<p>For the <em>siddhās</em>, their <em>antyayoga</em> is in actuality the very Śambhu <em>bhāva</em>. For such persons, no <em>antyeṣṭi</em> ritual is necessary. The devoted believer has to meditate this truth in his privacy. The <em>sūtrās</em> definitely mention that <em>mānasika kriyā</em> (focused and rightful rigorous mindful activity) is indeed the finest form of penance for the <em>yogi</em>. This is then accepted as the <em>lokarūḍhi</em> (worldly wisdom). Thus, while all these external ritual activity is conducted, the <em>kartr̥</em> has to put in every effort to do the _mānasika kriyā _simultaneously and respectively to its corresponding physical activity.</p>
<p>(The original tantric textual treatises are filled with many holographic errors. The study of these <em>vidhi</em> would have been better if such errors were circumvented with more manuscript sources of the same or co relational texts)Now then, the mortal remains are prepared for ritualistic burning.</p>
<p>In <em>Śrīvidyā tantra</em>, this last part of the funeral ceremony involves a lot of <em>bhāvana upāsana</em>. A <em>homa</em> offering is done with five <em>mantras</em> of <em>aghora</em> etc. with a <em>bhāvana</em> that the dead one shall reach <em>Śivasthāna</em>, (the state that has ensconced the thirty-three <em>tattvas</em>) the ultimate <em>mokṣa</em>. Another corpse bed is constructed using <em>darbha</em> grass, <em>bilva</em> tree sticks and the branches spreading towards the southern direction by <em>kulavr̥kśās</em> (they are: <em>śleṣmātaka</em> (<em>Cordia Dichotoma</em>),_ karnjākṣa <em>(<em>Pongamia Glavri</em>),</em> akṣa <em>(<em>Terminalia Bellirica</em>),</em> nimba <em>(<em>Azadiracta Indica</em>),</em> aśvattha_ (<em>Ficus Religiosa</em>),_ kadamba <em>(<em>Neolamarckia Cadamba</em>),</em> bilva <em>(<em>Aegle Marmelos</em>),</em> vaṭa <em>(<em>Banyan</em> tree i.e. <em>Ficus Benghalensis</em>),</em> udumbara <em>(<em>Ficus Racemosa</em>),</em> tintiṇī <em>(<em>Tamarindus Indica</em>)). This bed for the corpse is tied down with a cotton (three or nine) threaded string, the bed is then anointed with traditional herbal perfumes and the body is covered with new cloth. On this <em>śayana</em> (bed), a <em>maṇḍala</em> designed with <em>padma</em>,</em> trikoṇa_,_ ṣaṭkoṇa_,_ karṇikā_, eight petal <em>kamala</em> and upward lines are drawn and on that fresh flowers are strewn. On this, the body now is placed with its head facing the South direction, taking care that the head appears clearly. Now, this body is again sprinkled while chanting <em>rakṣaṇā mantra</em>. After this, with the chanting of <em>jvālāmālinī mantra</em>, the pyre is ceremoniously lit with the <em>mantra</em> starting with <em>daha</em> word. While the pyre is stably lit, the chanting continues with <em>aghora</em> and <em>pāśupata mantras</em>. This is the ultimate <em>homa</em> that any human can perform and hence this <em>homa</em> shall continue until the entire body is completely burnt to ashes. While the <em>kartr̥</em> is performing all these, the dead person’s relatives and belonging to same <em>gotra</em> (clan) would also join in doing <em>stotras</em> and <em>mantras</em> of their choice. The <em>Kalpasūtras</em> describe this momentous event that while the body is burning, the <em>yogigaṇa</em> assemble therein and with <em>vibhāvana</em> they ‘eat away’ the mortal remains. The <em>kartr̥</em>, while performing this ultimate <em>homa</em> (<em>citāgni</em>) does the <em>bhāvana</em> while chanting these verses from the <em>Kalpasūtrās</em>. While the last bit of the pyre is burning, the <em>kartr̥</em> sits beside the <em>maṇḍala</em> to do the <em>japa</em> of two <em>mūlamantra</em> of <em>Śrīvidyā</em> as given by the divine <em>Guru</em>. At the very end, the <em>kartr̥</em> does a <em>pūjā</em> that is specific to his <em>kula</em> or area. It is his ardent duty to guard the complete burning process and also the collection of the ashes from the pyre.</p>
<p>On the third, fifth or the seventh day, the <em>kartr̥</em> revisits the <em>citāgni</em> place and ascertains that the pyre has completely subsided. He then starts collecting the ashes from the leg side of the pyre and collects everything to store it in a new earthen pot. This pot head it tied with new cloth and is kept under a platform (<em>pīṭha</em>) in any one of these places convenient to him on the occasion: banks of a river, a clean water pond, nearby a temple, one’s own home surrounding etc. Around this <em>pīṭha</em>, three <em>mekhalās</em> (steps/stratum) are constructed. On this, the departed <em>guru</em>’s/<em>sādhaka</em>’s disciple or devotee shall perform _gurumaṇḍala pūjā _three times a day until the 11th day. On the 11th day a procession (<em>utsava</em>) is taken out to commemorate the life and achievements of the dear departed. Towards the end of this procession, a pot full of water (<em>kalaśa</em>) and adequate <em>dakṣiṇā</em> is given (<em>dāna</em>) to a very pious and pure hearted person (preferably a <em>samayī</em> or <em>Śrīvidyā upāsaka</em>). From then on the <em>kartr̥</em> shall compute the <em>ūṇa</em> and <em>māsika</em> ritual days based on accepted almanac and the _gurumaṇḍala pūjā _is performed. This shall happen for one full year. At the end of this year (<em>vārśika</em>) another ceremonious occasion is conducted and the buried earthen pot is extricated out of the three <em>mekhala</em>. This pot is then taken to a river tertiary (where its flow reaches the sea or ocean) and there on the banks the pot is finally laid to rest. Around this place, <em>kulavr̥kṣas</em> are planted, <em>gurupratimā</em> or <em>gurupādukā</em> are then carved out of stones or wood and is installed near this resting place on a very auspicious day. Should the <em>kartr̥</em> be fortunate to meet adepts in _kulāgama pāśupatamārga _persons or <em>sādhakas</em> in <em>vāmamārga</em> (eschatology), then he shall collect fifty darbha grass, spread them on the ground, the departed <em>preta</em> is then invited back onto the <em>darbha</em> grass bed and an important <em>kaula</em> ritual is conducted. After this, the <em>preta</em> shall acquire the Śambhu <em>bhāva</em>.</p>
<p>The all pious <em>Guru</em>, in his immeasurable compassion may teach all these to his devoted disciples. He may even help conduct such worthy event with the help of such disciples for the final emancipation of any true <em>sādhaka</em> or his own <em>śiṣya</em> on the last throes of his life. The <em>Kalpasūtras</em> prescribe a very interesting ritual for this event. A beautiful and well-proportioned doll is prepared with rice floor. Into this doll, the <em>ātman</em> of the near departing is drawn in (<em>ākarṣaṇa</em>). This is considered as the <em>pinḍa</em> of that person. For this <em>pinḍa</em>, all the above rituals are performed in their order. After all these actions, this <em>pinḍa</em> is kept on a <em>parākrama</em> (<em>gurupāduka</em> is also called as <em>parākrama</em>). After this the disciples and devotees shall offer separate <em>pinḍas</em> made out of rice floor to the <em>pinḍa</em> kept on the <em>gurupāduka</em> while chanting the five <em>praṇava</em> of <em>Śrividyā tantra</em>. After this, they shall offer <em>pūrṇāhuti</em>.</p>
<p>For the <em>siddhās</em>, their <em>antyayoga</em> is in actuality the very Śambhu <em>bhāva</em>. For such persons, no <em>antyeṣṭi</em> ritual is necessary. The devoted believer has to meditate this truth in his privacy. The <em>sūtrās</em> definitely mention that <em>mānasika kriyā</em> (focused and rightful rigorous mindful activity) is indeed the finest form of penance for the <em>yogi</em>. This is then accepted as the <em>lokarūḍhi</em> (worldly wisdom). Thus, while all these external ritual activity is conducted, the <em>kartr̥</em> has to put in every effort to do the _mānasika kriyā _simultaneously and respectively to its corresponding physical activity.</p>

<p><strong>The <em>Paraśurāma Kalpasūtra</em></strong></p>
<p>Towards the end of this text, the author says ‘<em>pareca śāstrānuśiṣṭāḥ</em>’ meaning, ‘I have said thus out of my intellect and cogitation, but it shall be correlated with other textual sources too’. Rāmeśvarasūri (1831 AD), who was a <em>praśiṣya</em> of the great Bhāskaramakhīndra (who authored the all-time useful text on <em>Sahasrarnāma bhāṣya</em>) has composed a <em>Vr̥ttī</em> (a textual compilation that describes a tenet of a discipline). Towards its end, in order to substantiate his arguments, he has given an <em>udāhṛti</em> (supportive corollary). This comprises of the <em>antyeṣṭi vidhi</em> from <em>Trikūṭārahasya</em> text, <em>Kaulaśrāddha vidhi</em> from the 56th chapter in <em>Devīrahasya</em> work’s Rudrayāmala, the famed Devī-Bhairava conversation extract that delineates the <em>Prāyaścitta Vidhi</em> from the 13th chapter in the work <em>Svatantratantra</em>, the <em>Mahāsāntapana Vrata Vidhi</em> from the <em>Br̥hatvāmakeśvara Tantra</em>, the <em>Maṇḍalalakṣaṇa</em> from <em>Yoginītantra</em> and from his own works he cites two textual sources to quote <em>prakīrṇakaviśaya</em> (cross-referenced discussions). Compiling all these he then has composed his <em>Vr̥tti</em>.</p>
<p>Out of this, the <em>Antyeṣṭividhi</em> (and the proceeding <em>śrāddha</em>) and <em>Kaulaśrāddhavidhi</em> will now be briefly delineated.</p>
<h2 id="antyeṣṭividhi">Antyeṣṭividhi</h2>
<p>Performance of <em>antyeṣṭi</em> for ones <em>Guru</em>,_ Śrīvidyā sādhaka_ is of prime importance to any <em>upāsaka</em>. If this duty is shirked, then there is no <em>maṇḍalaprāpti</em> for such a person, even though he may be a superior <em>sādhaka</em>. Here, the term <em>maṇḍala</em> has two meanings: a <em>maṇḍala</em> means a <em>kumārī</em> (maiden), <em>baṭuka</em> (=<em>vaṭu</em>, means a <em>brahmacārin</em>), two <em>suvāsinī</em> (two women who have built up their family effectively as good wives, daughter and mothers. This is their <em>vr̥ata</em>, the word <em>suvāsinī</em> is a composite of two segments: <em>su</em>=most propitious, + <em>vāsini</em> = dwellers, meaning she who dwells on auspiciousness), five <em>sāmayika</em> (an <em>sāmayika</em> is a <em>Śrīvidyā upāsaka</em>). A <em>maṇḍala</em> also means a congregation of all these. To <em>pūjā</em> offered to these is known as <em>maṇḍalapūjā</em>. The other meaning of <em>maṇḍala</em> is the attainment of <em>mokṣa padavi</em>. For any <em>upāsaka/sādhaka</em>, should he gain a place in this _maṇḍala samūha _(congregation), one of his prime duty is to perform the <em>antyeṣṭi</em> if and when needed. The author also gives an extended implication on this argument; if a <em>śiṣya</em> does not perform the <em>antyeṣṭi</em> of the <em>Guru</em> in proper time, then he does not belong to the <em>dīkṣākula</em>, thus making his <em>sādhana</em> null and void. For such a duty less person, the <em>maṇḍalasamūha</em> does not even help perform his <em>kaulaśrāddha</em>. (Details about <em>kaulaśrāddha</em> is discussed later on in this article).</p>
<p>The departed <em>Guru/sādhaka</em> enters the <em>maṇḍala</em> (emancipation) if the eschatological rites called <em>antyeṣṭi</em> is promptly performed for them within first <em>māsa</em> (lunar month) or first <em>vārṣika</em> (year = 12 lunar months) after the <em>mr̥tasūtaka</em> (proscriptive days after the death of a person) days end. <em>Tantraśāstra</em> segments three types of deceased <em>dīkṣita</em>: the <em>vīradūta</em> whose <em>bāhyasaṃskāra</em> (worldly eschatological rituals) is not performed at all, (<em>Śrīvidyā upāsaka</em> is also called as a <em>vīra</em> for, he controls his senses. In <em>Śivatattva</em>, the senses are termed as <em>vīra</em>, hence the <em>upāsaka</em> who controls them is also termed as <em>vīradūta</em>). The second variety is the <em>vīra</em> whose <em>bāhyasaṃskāra</em> is performed in correct order. The third variety is the <em>vīra</em> whose <em>bāhyasaṃskāra</em> is done along with special tantric <em>antyeṣṭi</em> rituals. However, <em>antyeṣṭi</em> is indeed a variety of <em>bāhyasaṃskāra</em>._ Tantraśāstra _provides many resolutions for whom <em>antyeṣṭi</em> was not performed for a reason. For such departed, the <em>kartr̥</em> should do the <em>japa</em> of the <em>mūlamantra</em> for ten thousand times and afterwards the <em>śrāddha</em> should be done. If such a person’s name (<em>dīkṣānāma</em>) is unknown, his worldly name can be used all through the rituals. <em>Tīrtha śrāddha</em> should be done during all days of important cosmic incidence, on death anniversaries (according to traditional almanac). <em>Śāstra</em> then declares that such a departed <em>upāsaka</em> henceforth belongs to the genealogy of the <em>kartr̥</em> and he attains the <em>vīratva</em>. The <em>bāhyasaṃskāra</em> is performed to get elevated from the <em>pretāvastha</em> (release from the spectral body) and the <em>antyeṣṭi</em> is performed to dwell in the <em>maṇḍala</em>. Both these mean that the departed can attain <em>vīratva</em> after the <em>sūtaka</em> days are over and the <em>sapiṇḍīkāraṇa</em> (unification of all parts of the lamented spectral body) is done for the departed.</p>
<p>Now, the <em>kartr̥</em> takes a holy bath (<em>śucirbhūtam</em>), finds a peaceful place and sits there in his <em>āsana</em> (a square piece made out of cloth or wood or grass etc and reserved only for such purposes) facing the North direction. He then does the <em>saṃkalpa</em> (ritualistically takes into his account the various <em>karmas</em> (activities) he has to perform). He gives <em>varaṇa</em> (formal invite) for the <em>ācārya</em> (the one who also guides him during the process) and <em>brahman</em> (the one who oversees everything). If in a situation, both are not present, then the <em>kartr̥</em> gives the <em>varaṇa</em> to <em>ācārya</em>. He then conducts the <em>navāvaraṇa pūjā</em> (<em>Śrīcakra yantra</em> has nine enclosures, each is connoted as an <em>āvaraṇa</em>, specific <em>pūjā</em> is prescribed for each of these).</p>
<p>The <em>kartr̥</em> now is empowered to conduct the next bit of ritual which is indeed centric to the whole process. He takes two measure of his spread palms (from tip of one of his spread out palm’s thumb to the other palm’s little finger tip, both palms held side by side) which would come to nearly 18 inches, and creates a <em>vedi</em> (platform) and on that, he draws a <em>Śrīcakra</em> out of <em>kumkuma</em> (the red powder make out of traditional substances) and does a measure of <em>pūjā</em> to it. Then, a doll of half of that size is modeled out of <em>kuśa</em> (<em>darbha</em>) grass, with its head hanging down (kept on the <em>Śrīcakra</em>). The <em>vīra</em> is then ascribed into this doll (<em>āvāhana</em>) with suitable <em>mantras</em>. This doll, until its final offering is thus named after the departed person (<em>vīra</em>). If the <em>vīra</em>’s name is unknown then the generic name of ‘Gaganānanda Nātha’ is ascribed to it.</p>
<p>The <em>kartr̥</em> now calls aloud the name of the <em>vīra</em> facing the doll (kept on the <em>Śrīcakra</em>) and whispers these verses in its ears; ‘O (the name or Gaganānanda Nātha) <em>vīra</em>! I prostrate before you with reverence! Do come and dwell here on the doll on this <em>Śrīcakra</em>. I have arranged this momentous holy occasion entirely for your beneficence. You are about to ascend to an ultimate bliss. Now, you enter this <em>maṇḍala</em>, cruise around various words within this <em>maṇḍala</em>, and head towards the <em>paramapada sadgati</em> (final emancipation).</p>
<p>And then the <em>kartr̥</em> performs the six types of <em>aṅganyāsa</em> and <em>karanyāsa</em> (ritualistic inglobation of the parts of the body and soul) for the <em>darbha</em> doll and the six types of <em>tanmātrā nyāsā</em> (they are <em>śabdākarṣiṇī</em>,_ rūpākarṣiṇī_,_ gandhākarṣiṇī_,_ rasākarṣiṇī <em>and</em> sparśākarṣiṇī_). With this, the body is consecrated. In the heart region, he does the <em>cittākarṣiṇī tanmātra nyāsa</em>. On the tip of the scalp, the <em>nyāsa</em> with the <em>mantra</em> ‘<em>krīṃ kālyāi namaḥ</em>’ is performed. On the throat region, the <em>aṅkuśa</em> weapon is symbolized by a <em>nyāsa</em> with the <em>mantra</em> ‘<em>krom marmakr̥ntinyai namaḥ</em>’. On the <em>brahmarandhra</em> (the inner sanctum on the tip of the scalp) the <em>nyāsa</em> with the <em>mantra</em> ‘<em>āṃ hrīṃ prāṇākarṣiṇyai namaḥ</em>’ is done. Now the doll acquires the name <em>kuśapuruṣa</em>. In the mouth of this <em>kuśapuruṣa</em>, with the <em>mantra nyāsa</em> of ‘<em>āṃ hrīṃ</em>’ is repeated. After all these, <em>mantras</em> like <em>kāladharma</em> etc. are recited with raised voice. At the end, there is an interesting episodic prescription where in the <em>kartr̥</em> cries aloud for the death of this <em>kuśapuruṣa</em> with profuse tears !</p>
<p>Now the dead <em>vīra</em>’s spirit is in the <em>kuśapuruṣa</em>. The <em>kartr̥</em> addresses him with these words; o <em>kuśapuruṣa</em>, the <em>kāladharma</em> is this death and it has to happen because the <em>kāla</em> ordains this. There is no escape from this nor should one futilely try to escape from this. Now that you have been elevated from your mortal remains, you have acquired immeasurable strength (<em>śakti</em>) and hence you are now the very embodiment of Śiva. Because you have attained the final identity with your real power, you have now conjoined with the Mahāśakti (Śīve Pārvati, the consort) and attained the <em>paśutva</em> state of being. Shed all your previous connections with the help of ‘<em>guruvākya</em>’ (<em>gurupādukā mantra</em> etc.) and become the very embodiment of Śiva (Śiva <em>rūpa</em>)’. Thus saying, the <em>kartr̥</em> then does the <em>saṃkalpa</em> to perform the <em>dehasaṃskāra</em> (offering of <em>kuśapuruṣa</em> to the ritual fire) in <em>Śivāgni</em>. He now performs the <em>nyāsa</em> on himself: he uses the <em>Śrīcakreśī Lalitā Tripurasundarī mantra</em> for this <em>nyāsa</em> (there is very elaborate system for this kind of <em>nyāsa</em> which is also done during the most important <em>navāvaraṇa pūjā tarpaṇa vidhi</em> during <em>Śrīcakrārcana</em> ritual). The <em>kartr̥</em> now does the _cakra pūjā _with a special <em>arghya</em> (offer of holy water with suitable verse), for this he uses the <em>vīra</em>’s name (<em>amukānandanātha vīrāya namaḥ</em>) and offers the <em>tarpaṇa</em> three times. He continues this ritual with sixteen (elaborate <em>pūjā</em>) or five (compact and small) kinds of <em>pūjā</em> offering and gives the <em>tarpaṇa</em> using the <em>mantra</em> ‘<em>Lalitā Mahātripurasundarīṃ tarpayāmi namaḥ</em>’.</p>
<p><em>Gārhapatyāgni</em> is the fire that was first ritualistically kindled during the marriage ceremony of an <em>upāsaka</em>. Now, this <em>agni</em> is indeed an integral part of many incidences of his life too. This <em>agni</em> is now installed on the side of the vedi where the <em>kuśapuruṣa</em> is consecrated. An <em>agnimaṇḍala</em> is then reconstructed therein. Into this, the divine mother Devī is invited to dwell and accept the offerings. Her <em>pūjā</em> and three times <em>tarpaṇa</em> are done. In this <em>agnimaṇḍala</em>, a <em>homa</em> is done using 108 <em>muttuga</em> (<em>audumbara</em> tree) sticks. The ghee is offerd while doing a <em>homa</em> with two large ‘spoons’. They are known as ‘<em>sr̥k</em>’ and ‘<em>śr̥va</em>’. Out of these, the <em>sr̥k</em> is filled with cow’s ghee, the <em>kuśapuruṣa</em> is kept on this. In that doll, the right leg of the <em>kuśapuruṣa</em> is kept on the other ‘spoon’ <em>sr̥va</em>. Both the spoons are now joined one above the other. While saying ‘<em>vaṣat</em>’, and chanting the <em>mantra</em> ‘<em>pūrṇāhutiṃ pradāsyāmi amukānandanātha vīrāya svāhā</em>’ the <em>kuśapuruśa</em> on the <em>sr̥k</em> and <em>śrva</em> is offered reverentially to the <em>mr̥tāgni</em> which is the very embodiment of <em>parāśaktirūpa</em>. After this awesome offering, a special prayer is to be done for the attainment of Brahman for the <em>vīra</em> with these verses ‘<em>tvaṃ vīrāgnau hutōsmin vai malaṃ bhautarūpakaṃ kārmaṃ mānsampyeva māyikaṃ cātaraṃ taṭhā | āṇavaṃ ca visr̥jyāgnau dhūmmārgeṇa cāṭhavā tejomārgeṇordhvalōkaṃ prāptaṃ te paramaṃ padaṃ | punrāvr̥tti rahitaṃ vraja mantraprabhāvataḥ | <em>After reciting this <em>mantra</em>, the <em>kartr̥</em> has to do the <em>japa</em> of his <em>mūlamantra</em>,</em> gurupādukā mantra</em> etc and finally offer the <em>kuśapuruṣa</em> into the <em>homakuṇḍa</em> (<em>kuṇḍa</em> = pit). After this <em>pūrṇāhuti</em>, 108 <em>audumbara samittu āhuti</em> is to be offered. This completes the later part of the <em>antyeṣṭi vidhi homa</em>.</p>
<p>Now, <em>sāmayika</em> (<em>Śrīvidyā upāsakas</em>) are to be invited along with <em>ācāryas</em> and their <em>satkāra</em> (cordial reception), an <em>udvāsanā</em> (relocation of their roles) is performed. From that day, the forth day is reckoned from the traditional almanac. On this day, a <em>kaula śrāddha</em> is done for the <em>vīra</em> along with <em>maṇḍalamelana śrāddha</em>. A (copper) vessel is kept separately and into it divinities called ‘<em>viśvedevā</em>’ are invoked. This represents <em>vīra</em>. From now onwards, <em>vīra</em> means a broader sense of the term. <em>Vīra</em> would now mean <em>pitāmahā</em> (<em>guru</em>’s_ guru_ of the <em>vīra</em>),_ pitā <em>(ones</em> guru_) and <em>vīra</em> himself, all together constitute <em>viśvedeva</em>. If in the event, the three <em>vīras</em> were ritually consecrated on the lines of the deliberations described above, then each of them a separate <em>maṇḍalamelana</em> is performed so that they attain the status of <em>guruvarga</em> like Mitreśānanda Nātha etc. For this the <em>kartr̥</em> has to do the <em>japa</em> of the <em>mūlamantra</em> for 10 thousand times for each of these <em>gurus</em> and after this the <em>maṇḍalamelana śrāddha</em> is peformed. Now an important factor is to be noted. The <em>vīra</em> for whom these deliberations are done need not be of the same <em>guruparampara</em> or lineage of the <em>kartr̥</em>. The <em>śāstra</em> provides a very important provision that, in order to do continue to do such essential <em>sādhanā</em> in <em>tantra</em>, the <em>vīra</em> and his <em>Guru</em> lineage now are deemed as belonging to the _dīkṣita vaṃśa _of the <em>kartr̥</em>. Even if the <em>vīra</em> and his gurus belong to a known <em>dīkṣita</em> clan, then the <em>kartr̥</em> is now empowered to perform the <em>maṇḍalamelana śrāddha</em> for them.</p>
<p>Before coming to the delineation of the <em>kaula śrāddha vidhi</em> (system description), a little bit of its speciality may be mentioned herein. In this <em>śrāddha</em>, the <em>vīra</em> is kept to face the west direction and the <em>pūjā</em> is done. The <em>maṇḍala</em> used to offer <em>pādyā</em> (holy water poured in a ritualistic way) is in a triangle shape. This is also the <em>pātrāsādana</em> (negotiation of the vessel) <em>maṇḍala</em>. The vessel for the <em>pitr̥</em> is first negotiated and then only the vessel of the <em>vīra</em> is taken up. Here, five <em>brāhmaṇas</em> are to be invited (one representing each: <em>vīra</em>,_ pitā_,_ pitāmahā_, two <em>viśvedevas</em>). In an unavoidable situation, when all these five cannot be found, then, one <em>brāhmaṇa</em> representing two <em>viśvedevas</em>, one representing <em>pitāmahā</em> and one for the <em>vīra</em> can be invited. The <em>pātrahavana</em> (consecration of the <em>śrāddha</em> vessels) are just like in the <em>kaulaśrāddha</em>. In order to do the <em>kaulaśrāddha</em> for the <em>vīra</em>, the <em>jalotsarga</em> (a special ritual done during any <em>śrāddha</em>) is performed for the <em>mantra</em> starting from ‘<em>saṃvinmaye</em>’ and ends with ‘<em>tadbhaveccivaṃ</em>’ (the entire <em>mantra</em> is given further down in this article). After this, the <em>mantra</em> starting with the word ‘<em>adyaprabhr̥ti</em>’ is chanted while the <em>vīrapātra kuladravya</em> (contents of vessel of <em>vīra</em>) is being transferred to the <em>pitr̥pātra</em>. In all the <em>upacāra</em> for the <em>vīra</em> during the conduct of <em>kaulaśrāddha</em> (starting from the very first <em>upacāra</em>,_ dīpaupacāra <em>and beyond) and also for the offering of the vessel (<em>pātrasamarpaṇa</em>), the <em>mantra</em> ‘<em>amukāya</em> (the name of the <em>vīra</em>)</em> vīrāya svāhaḥ_’ is to be used. After <em>vīra</em> comes his <em>pitā</em>, for this only ‘<em>mitreśarūpāya svāhaḥ</em>’ is to be used. And for the <em>pitāmahā</em>,_ ṣaṣṭhīśarūpāya svāhaḥ_ is used. After this the regular model ritual is to be followed. There are two <em>homa</em> for this <em>śrāddha</em> and all other ritualistic activity resembles the vedic pattern in this <em>kaulaśrāddha</em>.</p>
<h2 id="kaulaśrāddha-viḍhi">Kaulaśrāddha viḍhi</h2>
<p><em>Tantra śāstra</em> exalts the virtues of the <em>kaulaśrāddha</em>. It says that just by hearing about this ushers in the divine blessings. It goes further and says that even if thousends of other <em>śrāddhās</em> are done, if <em>kaulaśrāddha</em> is not done, then all that would be rendered waste, for, the <em>pitr̥s</em> and <em>viśvedevas</em> are not satisfied with just other vedic <em>śrāddha</em>! The <em>Śāktatantra</em> texts extoll this ritual and indeed describe it in unequivocal manner.</p>
<p>The first <em>kaula śrāddha</em> day is to be reakoned on or after a day from the day and time of death of the <em>vīr̥a</em> with the aid of traditional alamanac (<em>pañcāṅga</em>). On that day, the <em>kartr̥</em> should cleanse himself with bath and daily toiletries. He then gives <em>nimantraṇa</em> (formal invitation) to four or two <em>brāhmaṇas</em>. After performing <em>śuddha saṅkalpa</em>, the <em>kartr̥</em>, before the <em>viśeṣārghya pātra <em>(there will be two special vessels rekoned as <em>pitr̥ pātra</em> in between the general <em>viśeṣār̥ghya pātra</em> and Devī <em>viśeṣārghya pātra</em>. All the <em>mantras</em> and rituals done to consecrate the special <em>arghyapātra</em> (<em>viśeṣārghya pātra</em>) vessel should be repeated to consecrate <em>viśvedeva pātra</em> and <em>pitr̥ pātra</em> (<em>pātra</em>=vessel). In any tantric <em>pūjā</em>,</em> suvāsinī pūjā</em> (a <em>pūjā</em> for a housewife who has lead a pious life doing all the religious rigours called <em>vrata</em>) is an essential and integral part. In this <em>kaula śrāddha</em>, at this juncture, the last part of that <em>pūjā</em> ritual is to be performed now. After this, a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> is invited in lieu of a Caryā Nātha (an ancient <em>siddha</em>) embodiment and on him the <em>viśvedeva</em> is ascribed (<em>āvāhana</em>). If all the five other <em>brāhmaṇas</em> are also invited for the occasion, then each of them will take Ṣaṣṭhūśa Nātha (for <em>pitāmahā</em>), Uḍḍīśa Nātha (for <em>prapitāmahā</em>) and Mitreśa Nātha (other three ancient <em>siddhas</em>) for pitr̥ positions. However, if only one <em>brāhmaṇa</em> is there, then all the three can be ascribed on him and the <em>śrāddha</em> can be continued.</p>
<p>The <em>brāhmaṇas</em> are first offerd a seat (<em>āsana</em>) and after prostrating before him (or them), these words of welcome is spoken (actually these are verses and I have given their translations herein) ‘O revered <em>viśvedevas</em>, I welcome you, I wholeheartedly offer to you this ‘<em>kṣaṇa</em>’ (ceremonious invite). Please do dwell peacefully until the rituals are concluded. With affection and peace, kindly accept my humble ‘<em>kṣaṇa</em>’. After having said that, they are given the following <em>maṇḍala</em> to be seated: square <em>mandala</em> for <em>viśvedevas</em>, circular <em>maṇḍala</em> for the <em>pitr̥s</em> (<em>pitr̥</em>,_ pitāmahāḥ_ and <em>prapitāmahāḥ</em>). Their feet are washed, <em>sāmānya arghya</em> (from the general <em>arghya</em> vessel) is offered, <em>ācamana</em> rituals are offered along with <em>madhuparka</em> (special variety of banana dipped in raw honey), <em>snāna</em> (a facility for cleansing), <em>vastra</em> (new cloths) etc. As the last thing, the <em>dīpapūjā</em> is offered. All <em>pujas</em> done for the <em>pitr̥s</em> are repeated for the <em>viśvedevas</em>. And later, the <em>viśvedeva</em> vessel is offerd with the verse ‘O <em>viśvedeva</em> ! This is offered to you (<em>svāhaḥ</em>)’. The <em>pitr̥</em> vessels are offered likewise to the <em>brāhmaṇas</em> who are now acknowledge in the positions of the three <em>pitr̥s</em>. The great Rāmeśvarasūri who belonged to the disciple lineage of Bhāskarācārya gives a special note here that, while in the vedic traditions, there are ritualistic <em>mantras</em> even for offering the things, for <em>sāktas</em> only <em>svāhaḥ</em> is enough and adequate.</p>
<p>These are the <em>mantra</em> veses that are recited while the <em>viśvedevas</em> (on square <em>maṇḍala</em>) and <em>pitr̥s</em> (in circular <em>maṇḍala</em>) are offered <em>pūjās</em>,_ bhojana _vessels (food plates and such), water, <em>hastodaka</em> (water to wash their hands and feet);</p>
<p><em>Samvinmaye mahāpātre ānandamayabhojyakaṃ |</em></p>
<p><em>Bhoktā tvam puruṣaḥ sākśī mahāśktirmaheśvaraḥ ||</em></p>
<p><em>Sarvamannam śaktimayam bhoktām sākṣāt paraḥ svayaṃ |</em></p>
<p><em>Tasmāt sarvam śivaḥ sākṣāt bhoktā dātā ca bhojyakaṃ ||</em></p>
<p><em>Viśvedevā devatā no bhunjan tvatra makhe mama |</em></p>
<p><em>Yāvacchakyam tāvadiha bhoktavym svasthamānasaiḥ ||</em></p>
<p><em>Peyam khādyam bhakṣyabhojyam sarvam vastu samarpitaṃ |</em></p>
<p><em>Pitr̥ṇām paramānandahetave tad bhavecchivaṃ ||</em></p>
<p>(The eater, eating, the process of eating are all one and same; that is ‘<em>annam</em>’ the holy offered food. The person who has offered and the person who has taken part are all one and the same and thus is the very embodiment of Śiva (<em>Śivamayaṃ</em>). In this holy a_nna yajña_, it is <em>viśvedevas</em> who are partaking the offered food. O <em>brāhmaṇas</em>, I humbly request you to eat, drink, and take all the <em>bhakṣyabhojyas</em> (an explanation is given for this term after this). The very essence of this action will please the <em>pitr̥s</em>, and thus becomes Śiva full (<em>Śivamaya</em>)).</p>
<p>(Information on the <em>bhakṣyabhojya</em>: the food that is served on these occasions are of six types: <em>Peya</em>, that liquid which is sipped (eg. Sugarcane juice) (<em>coṣya</em>):_ Pānaka_, those liquids that are drunk (for eg. Water, _rasam,_a spicy hot liquid preparation which are also mixed with rice to eat); <em>Lehya</em>, all those which are licked and enjoyed; <em>Bhojya</em>, the staple diet eating things like rice etc.; <em>Bhakṣya</em>: special adjucts that resemble snacks like those which are fried, baked balls etc.; <em>Carvya,</em> a special kinds of food suppliments which are also called as <em>khādya</em>).</p>
<p>Thus said, the <em>śrāddha kartr̥</em> pours one spoon of water (<em>uddharaṇa</em>) for both the <em>viśvedevasthāna</em> and <em>pitr̥sthāna</em>. This is called as an <em>āpośana</em>. The act is called <em>jalotsarga</em>. The <em>brāhmaṇās</em> who are occupying both these postures now would eat to their fulfillment (of the <em>bhakṣya</em>,_ bhojya_,_ khādya_,_ peya_,_ pānaka_, and some more items of food called <em>kuladravya</em> (food specialities that are specific to that <em>kaula</em> tradition for at least two generations). All the while, the <em>śrāddha kartr̥</em> does the prayer and encouragement to the <em>brāhmaṇas</em> that this very act would now satisfy the <em>viśvedevā</em> and the <em>pitr̥s</em>. This_ anna yajña_ is nearing its fulfillment. At the end of the feast, an <em>uttarāpośana</em> is given (concluding event with another <em>uddharaṇa</em> spoon of water offered with suitable <em>mantras</em>). A <em>tambūla</em> (beetle leaves and <em>areca catechu</em> seeds), with adequate <em>dakṣiṇā</em> (money, usually the local currency, but in rare cases gold coins) are given reverentially (places on the sides of the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> seats). A prayer is now done: “O divinity, with this activity that I have now undertaken, may you grant the wish that the <em>pitr̥</em>,_ pitāmahā_,_ prapitāmahā _attain the <em>paramapada</em>, the final blissful <em>pitr̥loka</em>. A <em>pradakśiṇā namaskāra</em> (holding the <em>arghya</em> vessel and an <em>uddharana</em> spoon inside, the <em>kartr̥</em> goes around (three times) the <em>brāhmaṇas</em>) is also performed.</p>
<p>With the following verse, the release (<em>udvāsana</em>) of the <em>brāhmaṇas</em> are done:</p>
<p><em>Yathāāgatam ca pitaro gacchantvasmān mahāmakhāt |</em></p>
<p><em>Viśvairdevaiśca sahitāḥ prsannāḥ santu me ciraṃ ||</em></p>
<p>Now, the <em>sāmayikas</em> (<em>Śrīvidyā</em> practioners) are offered special <em>pūjā</em> and the entire activity is surrenderd to Goddess Lalitādevī.</p>
<p>Rāmeśvarasūri, after describing and prescribing the <em>kaulaśrāddha</em> and <em>antyeṣṭi</em>, stresses their importance thus; both these (<em>antyeṣṭī</em> and <em>kaulaśrāddha</em>) are formed based on the <em>sūtrās</em> in the _Paraśurāma Kalpasūtra _and thus it is most authoritative and essential duty (for a <em>upāsaka</em> to follow and practice). In that <em>śāstra</em>, the act of not doing it is described as a defect and the <em>śāstra</em> decries it. In the other treatise <em>Tripurārahasya</em> too it is quite so and that treatise goes on to say that there are other things also that ought to be done. Thus, it may be inferred here that for those <em>upāsakas</em> who follow <em>Paraśurāma Kalpasūtra</em> this <em>śrāddha</em> and <em>iṣṭi</em> is essential. The <em>Tripurārahasya</em> text also makes a provision that (since there are other alternatives), the performance of these <em>śrāddha</em> and <em>iṣṭi</em> is not entirely an absolute necessity but a preferred activity. There is a corroboration in the vedic <em>śrāddha</em> practice too. The _Āpasthamba Kalpasūtra _and other <em>ācāryas</em>, in their <em>sūtrās</em>, do not generally agree with each other in their prescriptions and activity essentials, but for one ecception, that is, they all quote and follow the <em>sūtra</em> of Bhāradhvāja. A similar inference can also be drawn in the present tantric context. The spirit, mood and desire for these entire activity springs from the anxity that not performing would make the practice that much poorer and worthless.</p>
<p>This is a moral and philosophical tenet in tantric practice; the very birth is to aquire <em>upāsanā</em> that would enable the <em>sādhaka</em> to attain <em>maṇḍala</em>._ Maṇḍala <em>in</em> tantra _means a state that is superior to <em>Brahmaloka</em>, attainment of three <em>ogha</em> (multitudes), and total annulment of rebirth. <em>Antyeṣṭi</em> and <em>śrāddha</em> are the most essential activity to attain this <em>mahāpuruśārtha</em> (<em>maṇḍala praveśa</em>). If this is not performed, then, it is little wonder that the <em>śāstras</em> proclaim this mawkishness as ‘<em>atidūśita</em>’ (meaning totally decriable). Thus the conduct of <em>antyeṣṭi</em> and (<em>kaula śrāddha</em>) are absolutely essential for a <em>sādhaka</em>.</p>
<p>What more is to be said, then?</p>

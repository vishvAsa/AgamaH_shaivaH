I am a SriVidyaUpasaka. I belong to the lineage of Adi Shankara Bhagavatpadal via Sureshwaracharya, Shantanandanatha and Sri Chidanandanathar (Parameshti Guru), Sri Anantanandanathar (Paramaguru), and Sri Sri Sri Kameshwaranandanathar (Swaguru).

Daily I wake up at 3 a.m. and do Sahasra Gayatri japa.  
After that, I do Prathasandhyavandanam followed by Samhitadhanam (as I am a brahmachari).  
Then I do my SriVidya Prathasandhyavandanam along with Moolamantra japa.  
I also perform Laghu Navavarana Pooja (Mahayaagakramam or Saparya Paddhati).  
This usually ends by 8 a.m.

Then I do Madhyanika along with Brahma Yagnam and SriVidya Madhyanikam.

In the evening, I do Saayamsandhyavandanam with Samhitadhanam, Saayam SriVidya Sandhyavandanam, and Soundarya Lahari Parayanam.

At night, I do SriVidya Turiya Sandhyavandanam.

This is my nitya karma anushtana on a daily basis, like a tailadhara, by the grace of my Gurunathar.

For your kind information, my post is Scientist-B and I am working in DRDO.

We are Smarthas and Advaitins.
We follow the rule
“अन्तः शक्तः बहिः शैवः व्यवहारेषु वैष्णवः।”

## Svacchanda
The lineage of the Śrīkula centered on the trisyllabic Tripuraśekhara is taught in the Nityāṣoḍaśikārṇava section of the Vāmakeśvara-tantra (NS 4.15-18).

> tataḥ svacchanda-rūpā tu  
> paribhramya jagat punaḥ ।  
tena cāreṇa saṃtuṣṭā  
punar ekākinī satī ॥

> Thereafter, verily <taking the form of Svacchanda (Bhairava or his Bhairavī counterpart) | taking any form she wishes>,  
> again roaming the universe, she then becomes satisfied by these wanderings and again becomes solitary.

One could ask whether the interpretation of Svacchanda-rūpā could be connected to Svacchanda Bhairava. 

Śivānandanātha philosophically explains it thus:

> svacchandarūpā mahad avaṣṭambhena niryantraṇa-pracārā । jagat cidambaram avalambya tad rūpatayā sphurat ।
>
> Svacchandarūpā means she, in the form of a barricade, restricts the going forth of mahat. The world emanates through the support of the conscious space in that form.

The link to the void or space of consciousness presented here also applies to the Bhairava in the interpretation centered on him found elsewhere in the tantric tradition. Hence, we consider the allusion to the Svacchanda to be a potentially valid interpretation.

## 3-syllable
> ramate svayam avyaktā  
tripurā vyaktim āgatā ।
tattva-traya-vinirdiṣṭā  
varṇa-śakti-trayātmikā ॥

> She takes delight by herself in her unmanifest form as Tripurā;  
> when she becomes manifest,  
> she is indicated by the three principles [in the form] of the triad of Śakti-s of the letters.

> vāgīśvarī jñānaśaktir  
vāgbhave mokṣarūpiṇī ।
kāmarāje kāmakalā  
kāmarūpā kriyātmikā ॥

> The jñānaśakti known as Vāgīśvarī is in the vāgbhava (aiṃ),  
> who is of the form of liberation.  
> In the kāmarāja (klīṃ) she is Kāmakalā, of the form of desire, who is the kriyāśakti.

> śaktibīje parā Śaktir  
> icchaiva Śivarūpiṇī ।
evaṃ devī tryakṣarā  
tu mahā-tripurasundarī ॥

> In the Śaktibīja (sauḥ), she is Parā, the Icchāśakti, who is of the very form of Śiva. Thus indeed is the goddess of three syllables, the great Tripurasundarī.

It is clear from the original text of the Nityāṣoḍaśikārṇava  
that this mantra of Mahātripurasundarī was conceived as having three syllables. 

The first two syllables are obvious; the third, while called the Śaktibīja, is specifically identified with the goddess Parā, making it clear that it is sauḥ and also establishes the connection with the old Pūrvāmnāya (Trika). 

Śivānandanātha, commenting much later, connects the Paramparā with that of the Hādividyā lineage of Śrīvidyā;  
however, this should be seen as secondary, as the text itself is clear in referring to the mantra as trisyllabic. 

Notably, the ritual and exegetical tradition of the Saundaryalaharī also identifies this trisyllabic mantra as a distinct mantra of Tripurasundarī. 

It is believed to be encoded in S 7 (kvaṇat kāñcī dāmā…). 

The exegetical tradition on this verse cites the Rudrayāmala-tantra, stating that Śiva extracted the Tripuraśekhara-mantra as the essence after churning the Varṇamāla. This action is signaled by his epithet Puramathitṛ in the verse, which then serves as the encoder of this mantra.

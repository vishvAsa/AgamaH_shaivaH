## Initial paths
The evolution of the classical Śrīkula from the Dakṣiṇāmnāya appears to have proceeded along two initial paths.  

We believe that one was influenced by the Pūrvāmnāya and its chief deity Parā. This led to the incorporation of the arṇa of Parā, sauḥ, into the central mantra of the cult in the form of the triadic Tripuraśekhara mantra, featuring the Vāgbhava, Kāmakalā, and Parā kūṭa-s.

The other lineage (Śrīvidyā) was influenced by the Paścimāmnāya and used the Pañcadaśī (Ṣoḍaśī) as its primary mantra. The Pañcadaśī can be seen as featuring a “resolved” form of the central mantra-s of Kubjikā and Navātman-bhairava. 

## kubjikA influence
The exegetical tradition of the Saundaryalaharī also recognizes a deep connection between the central Śrīkula yantra, the Śrī-cakra and the Paścimāmnāya.  

### 9 yonis
In the commentary on S 34, which describes the supreme deity couple of the Paścimāmnāya, it is stated that the 9-fold form of the Bhairava (Navātman) and the goddess Samayā correspond to the 9 constituent triangles of the Śrīcakra. 

In the Śakti-para meditation on the Samayā Navātmikā, the 9 triangles are taken to be yoni-s representing the following 9 goddesses: the 4 with their apices in one direction are Vāmā, Jyeṣṭhā, Raudrī and Ambikā emerging from the ancient Śaiva mantra-s.  
The 5 with their apices pointing in the opposite direction are Icchā, Jñānā, Kriyā, Śāntā and Parā. 

It is then refracted back through a Śrīkula lens with the whole nonad taken to represent the form of Ānandabhairava. 


Consistent with this connection,  
the Śrīcakra resembles the complex, secret yantra of the Kubjikā-mata,  
which accompanies the mantra specified in the Kubjikopaniṣad. 

### Bālā yantra
However, if the three-triangle yantra, now associated with the Tripuraśekhara-mantra (The Bālā yantra), is the predecessor of this class of yantra-s,  
then it is likely that the origin of the Śrīcakra might have involved some back-and-forth between the Dakṣiṇāmnāya, Paścimāmnāya and their evolutes.

Both the promulgators of the uttarAmnAya traditions, niShkriyAnandanAtha and vAtUlanAtha use the peculiar word "Chumm[aA]" for the secret teachings of their AmnAya. For example, the Kashmirian tradition of anantashakti states:

> iha kila ShaD-darshana-chaturAmnAyAdi-melApa-paryanta-samasta-darshanottIrNam  
> akathyam api  
> shrImad-vAtUlanAthasya pITheshvaryash Chumma-pAdaugham uktvA...

> Here it is indeed stated the teaching of the statements of the ChummA-s transcends all systems [namely] starting from the six philosophical traditions, the four AmnAya-s and the like up to the melApa, [and] although not to be spoken, goddesses of the pITha-s having expounded the [sUtra-s] of the venerable vAtUlanAtha...[taught him the supreme reality].

The origin of the word Chumma remains unclear. There another phonetically word Chomma use for the secret gestures of the mantramArga practitioners. Was it from an extinct tribal language? An invented word?

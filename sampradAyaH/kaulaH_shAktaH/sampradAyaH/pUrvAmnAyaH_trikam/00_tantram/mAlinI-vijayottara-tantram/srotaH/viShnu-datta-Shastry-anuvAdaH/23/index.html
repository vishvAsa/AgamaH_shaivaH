<p>VII. NOTES ON THE TEXK.</p>
<p>FIRST ADHIKARA.</p>
<p>LLLLL</p>
<p>NOTES.</p>
<p>Verse 1: The term Jnana Candra in the text means oit or Cit Sakti for whioh no english tsin is oqui.</p>
<p>valent. The word is translated by consciousness overy</p>
<p>where.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;Mukha means the Sakti or giva (cf. Saivi mukhamehooyate, V.Bhai).</p>
<p>The Jagadananda® in the text befers to the ultimate Reality, T.A. 1st. A. Oom. 1st, verse. Besides, It also refers to the one and last of the six stages or pleasure, viz., N1Jananda, Parananda, Brahmand, Mahananda, oidananda, and Jacadananda. The stage is totally free from all dirrerentiations and it represents the state of</p>
<p>Parahanta.</p>
<p>The conception &ldquo;Cit&rdquo; or &ldquo;Olt Saktin in Indian Philosophy is unique. The Western thinkers havo rodunod the phenomenal appearance into W111, Idea, Intention or Imagination. But it is Indian Philosophy whioh has reduo ad the whole creation into the concept or &ldquo;010&rdquo; (congoiousness) which pervadeg all the universo in the form or consciousness sub-consciousness and unconso iousness. Thus the visible world in its root as well as in ito manifestation 19 1 consoiousnesa. This idea is referred to by the worát &ldquo;Marioayah&rdquo; (Rays) in the text, whloh belons to Siva, who 18 said to be &ldquo;the moon of knowledgo&rdquo; (Jnana Candra). As</p>
<p>the rays of the moon are not dirferent from hor. aimilarly</p>
<ol start="186">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Sakti or power of Siva is not different from the powerholder (Sakt iman). Thus Sive the male principle, in its quiesoont state is whole and absolute, but in its manifested State, it becomes Sakti, which is part and parool of its nature. The whole, though Sakti as a part is separated from it, st111 rema ing whole or full (Purna). Its fullness nover ceases. The one becomes many in its active state but at the aene time it holds its oneness and porreotion. The como idea 19 explained in Saktayosya Jagatsarvam&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Verse 3. Siva Sakti ummukhi Karana - to bo Inspired by Sakti holds an important place in the Trika Philosophy of Kashmir. The other Philosophical scholars of India also stress on this inspiration and call it &ldquo;Divine krace which is not dirrerent from the Sanskrit words&quot;Anugraha&rdquo; and &ldquo;Anukampa&rdquo;. For the spiritual reall-, sation, divino grace is highly essential. Śaiva and Salta philosophers of India call it &ldquo;Sakt 1° which assumes many forms and produces diversirication of the unity or Lord Siya. It is this Sakti that lies united with siya in Hig repose in its latent form and is inactive. In its potont. form, it acts and manifests the whole universo. Tho Salti as a power or energy is everywhere. This Sakti ohining in us 18 intuition that it inspires man to understand the highest goal and makes him realise the truth of truthz. This intuition 18 different from reason which belongs to the World of senses. It has no hold over superhuman objects. When reason is ulumined by Sakti or by the 1 grace of God, it becomes intuition and is denoted by many terms such as Saksatkara, dardana and Anubhava oto. Tho Upanisads call it &ldquo;Agrya Buddhi&rdquo; in tho vorso &ldquo;Drsyato Tvagrya Buddhya Suksmaya Sukomaadarsibh ih&rdquo; (The universal selt is perceived through their penetrating and subtle in telleot by the men or subtle perception). Srimad Bhagavat187.</p>
<p>Gita names it Euddhiyoga in the tenth verge of tho Book x &ldquo;Dadar 1 buddhiyogam tam Yena Uam upayanti te&rdquo;. (I 81vo may devotees tha Yoca of wisdom through which they coke to me).</p>
<p>This divine inspiration, in its highest form, is regarded as &ldquo;Rudra Sakti S amavesa&rdquo; (Uniricntion with the Sakti of Rudra or Siva) or simply ngakt ipata&rdquo; (For the detailed information T.A. 13th A and Ma Vijayottara Tantra ist. adhi. 42, 43 and 44).</p>
<p>Verse 7. Sa ivism and Saktian equally lay stress on the doctrine or enjoyment-Salvation (Bhuktl-Muktivada). The manifested universe, which is produced by Maya according to the philosophy of Vedanta, 19 trensitory and ephemeral. The Salves and Saktas do not deny it. It is the manires tation of the Sakti, whioh belong to Sive and therefore, it 13 real. As waves of water, flames or the firé and rays of the sun are not different from water, fire and tho gun respectively, similarly the diversified universo la not dirferent from the Bhairava&rdquo;. V.Bhai, 110. All the objects of the senses and enjoyments of the world, we seo, are enlightened by Siva. He is everywhere, hence his product is also real and enjoyable. The liberation, accord ing to Śaiva philosopher, is not other than the expansion of consciousness (cit Sakti) of Siva. The enjoyment or vordly things does not stand in the way of spiritual zoalization. Therefore, the Śaiva Philosophy treats enjoyment and 11 bera tion alike.</p>
<p>The enjoyer (Bhoktr) has changed himsolr into the form of the enjoyable things (Bhogya). Thus tho enjoyment of the sensuous things oannot produce any obstruotion in tho way of the mataphysical reality as the enjoyer and the en joyable are one and the same. (T.A, 9th. A., Co. pago</p>
<p>172).</p>
<ol start="188">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Thero 18 nothing inpure in this world which is the finit isation of the infinite. The world is real and enjoy. able. (T.A., 4th. A., pace 268).</p>
<p>Verge 13 and 14. The term &lsquo;Aghora from whioh Siva learns the contents or Siddhayogiavari Tantra means Supreme Reality free from space and time. It is the state or transcendency and represents as united whole or 31va and Sakti (s iva-3 akti-Samarasya). It also implies the Supreme State of Sabda (sound) or und istinguished form. As a matt of fact, the Sabda, in its unman ifested form, la consoious</p>
<p>ness.</p>
<p>The Mr. T. 1st. Ve.lst. P.22, has explained Aghora in the sense of Mahesvara (Niskala or transoendent Siva) wio 18 said to be oongo iousness (ava boahe Rupa) and from whom all words (Sabias) evolve.</p>
<p>From the Tantrika point of view, this state of subtle Sabda 13 oalled &ldquo;Para Val&rdquo; &ldquo;The Vaiyakaranas roga</p>
<p>it as Sphota or subtle unit of Sabda, from which all arti. culate sounds prooaed. Ordinarily we can call it Sabda Brahman. In all respects, its infinitude cannot be questioned.</p>
<p>Verse 15. The meanings of the word &ldquo;Anu&rdquo; in ti • text are not clear as it is included in the group or acce: C a ble principles. Undoubtedly everywhere, anu implies ro lation with Mala (impurity) which belongs to the other group (avoidabla), viz., Sakala and pralayakala. Therer it should be noted that the term &ldquo;Any&rdquo; likely ütands for the vijnakala due to ita inclusion in the acceptable tatt Besides, the Vijnakala pranata 18 superior to Sakala and pralaya kala prametrs which are bound by two and three ta respectively, while the former has only ono Nala (anavame</p>
<ol start="189">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Verse 16. In the verse, three impurities Anava, Tarms and Mayiya Mala, which veil the real nature of give, are mentioned. The Anava Mala is most important or all the</p>
<p>three because the whole process or creation depends on it.</p>
<p>The nature of the Anava mala its regarded as obsduration of the essential characteristics of Siva, which are consciousness and freedom. Veiling of the nature of 3iva , is caused by his own will, T.Sa. mentions that the Aneva mala is not different from the will of Siva, which oonoeals his chief feature, (or. Soyan Malah Paramoavarasya 3vatna Pracohadanecohato Nanyat Yincidasti, T.Sa. Sth. A.).</p>
<p>The mala is or two kinds. The first kind is that when the conscious nature of Siva 1080g its freedom (Sva tantrya). The Vijnakala pramata represents this kind because it is conso iousness devoid from freedom (ci. Vina nain Bod hatmakam Rupam Kovalam (Svatantrya Rahitamasya asti iti vijnanakovali (T.A. 9th. A Comm 02).</p>
<p>The second kind of the Mala is that wisen froedom free from consciousness remains.</p>
<p>Ir the rirst kind Jnana predominates but it has no freedom. In the second kind, there is freedom but consciousness d 18 appears.</p>
<p>The second Mala is Karma (related to Karma) Mala | which appears in the form of the enjoyment of the bad deeds.</p>
<p>This Mala is mainly said to be the cause of the world and degrades Anus till the next dissolution takes placo.</p>
<p>The third Mala is Maya Mala, which appears as body</p>
<p>and the world. The illuţion of the wordly things deludes the anus and they get themselves attached to the showy world</p>

</ol>
<p>The dontrine of the three impurities is specially connected with the seven Prametrs, Sekala, Pralayakala, Tijnanakala, Mantra, Martresvara, Mantramahesvara, and Siva. To understand the proper function of the Malas in the gradual ascent of a spiritual seeker, a brief desori ption of the seven Pranatrs (experiencers) in ascending order is necessary.</p>
<p>Sakal Pranata (The worst form of the individual self) possesses all the three Malas already oited and thinka</p>
<p>that the objects of this universe are the only aim of life.</p>
<p>He is at a loss to distinguish between the subjeative and the objective aim of the life. The subjective stage is far from his approach. He m1gunderstands his objeоtive life as eubjective one. He 19 fully involved in the tattvas pron the earth to the Fale tattva. This Pramata wanders in the tattvas and thinks them as a subjective Reality oving to the taints which hav entangled him into the tattvas, Siva, the highest measurer, in the form of a lower Pramata, that</p>
<p>19 Sakala Premata, forgets His real state and remains in</p>
<p>volved in the Mundane objeots for centuries.</p>
<p>The Pranata</p>
<p>cannot rige high unless the wonderful Sakti-Pata takes place</p>
<p>and elevates him.</p>
<p>In short, the Sakala Pranata repres onts the materialistic state and regards the nonself as self (Anat</p>
<p>meni Atina bhava).</p>
<p>Prajayakala Pramata has two Malas, Karma and Maya mala and represents a bit higher state than that or the Sakala. The Pramata is totally free from all the tattvas except Maya wherein it remains involved until the new oreation takes place. The transformation or the Prematr into the status of the vijnanakala is not possible unless the Karma mala, the duration of which is upto båya tattva,</p>

<p>The vijnanakala Stage 1. just like a midaling stair-093e, from which the spiritual journey la said to be easily acoessible. The Pranata knows the conscious natura of Siva temporarily. The cause of this waving state is anave due to which, the Pranata cannot attain perfection in its self-realisation.</p>
<p>The Vignanakala Pranata is auperior to those already mentioned, in two respeots. Firstly it has only one mala and secondly this Mala is also d&rsquo;esirous to be destroyed (Didhvans iau).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Mantra Pranata is a higher stage. It is free from all taints except the Anava Mala which is also boing destroyed (Dhvamgamana). In Vignanakala Pranata, Anava Mala is desirous of being destroyed but here it is under the power of being actually destroyed..</li>
</ol>
<p>The two qualities or aspects, 1.0, Prakasa, (Manifesting aspects) and Vimaraa (the manifestod aspadt) are balanoed in this Pramata and this is the stato or Puro Path, i.e. Suddha Vidya in which Io (Aham) and Thig. (Idam are equally balanced. In other words, the aubicotive and the objeot ivo tendency of the Premata are squal.

<ol start="192">

<p>and intorior (Samadhi) tendenoy of the measurer is in a perfectly balanced state. The inrinite state is still out of his approach. The Pranata somat imea reols porturbed owing to the Vyutthana and at other he is quito calm on account of the Samadhi state. His wavering state has not disappeared totally as the two States (Vikalpa and Samadhi) have their separability and aotivity.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>The Mantresvara Pranata is a higher state than that of the Mantra state. The Anava Mala is destroyed (Dhvasta). The objeotive tendency of the Premata is more active than the subjective one. The stress lles on &ldquo;This (Idam) and not on &lsquo;I&rsquo; (Ahem). The state corresponds to Isvara tattva which the diversity dominates for the timo being. The idea or &ldquo;This or That&rdquo; (Idam Bhava) has not yet totally disappeared. This universal conoclouenoss 18 more bent towards the objective worla then to the subjective ons. The Premata obtains the capaoity of doing good and harm (Sapanugrahakaryegu Saltata) (T.A. 13th A.. 185), but the state or Siva Pramata is at 111 d 13tant.</p>

<p>Siva.</p>
<p>In this stage the least differentiation of tho</p>
<p>univerge or in other wordg the idea of the separation or the world from himself which was more active in the Mantre svara state, a bit fades away. Though tho 1dea of 1-1038 (Anambhava) prevails more rapidly and actively, tho idea of *This&rsquo; (Idam Bhava) has not yet died out absolutely. There is emphasis on the &lsquo;I&rsquo; out or the two terms I&rdquo; (Aham) and &ldquo;This&rdquo; (Idam). Oneness of Siva is yet to be realised.</p>
<ol start="7">

<p>Vərse 18. The two terms &ldquo;Sakalao end Niskala mentioned in the verse mean Vigvamaya (imanental) and visva ttirna (transcendent) nature of siva. Vigvamaya state of Siva implies his free will while the Visvottirna refers to</p>
<p>his consciousness.</p>
<p>His Sakti, in its unmanifestad form,</p>
<p>has also the same attributes,</p>
<p>Verse 19. In the verse the process or creation is mentioned. The transcendent Siva, by his free will, creates eight Vidyesvaras aghora, parama hora etc. In the place or this group, Mr.1.1.4 mentions Ananta, Sukama, Sivottama, Ekanatra, Eka rudra eto, T.A. 8th A algo follows this order.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, this group or oight lords are said to be creators of the impuro road (Asuddhavadhvan) wh 110 Siva is a ruler of the puro path (ci. Sudalva Dhvani</p>
<ol start="195">

</ol>
<p>Siyah Karta Prokto nanto Sito Prabhuh T.A. ath.). The group of the eight Mantramahesvarao 13 eocompanied by tho nine Saktis Vama eto. and the Seven Karores or the lantras.</p>
<p>This first creation or Sive, though has the characteristios, consciousness (Jnana) and Salti (freedom) which are found in Siva himaalf, but it oarnot dosorve to have the status of its Lord due to the ignoranca (Agu Vidya) which is also found in it.</p>
<p>As regards the naturo or thesa Vidyesvaras, Mr. T. olearly mentions that they are a bit below tho position or Paramesvara and are said to be servants (Niyojya) of Siva</p>
<p>(cf. adhikara Mala Vasegat Kinoit Ana vaptaparangavaraganya it yasyaite preryah Mr. I 4, 4, Conx).</p>
<p>As Mantra-mahesvaras are servants or Sive, s41 larly mantras are also serventa (Niyoye) of apara Mantros</p>
<p>varas which are under the Parawantrosvarag.</p>
<p>We should note that this state of a xulcr and tho</p>
<p>ruled (Preraka prerya bheva) continues in the process of</p>
<p>creation.</p>
<p>Verge 21. The number of seven drors mantrag la divided into two parts. The first half of the mantras is sent to universe to be used by Sadhakes for their doll realisation.</p>
<p>The remaining hall is reserved by Siva to be utilized by his own will at any time.</p>
<p>Verge 22. The mention of two Prematus, that is, vijnanakala and Pralayakala, points out that tho Sakald Pramatr has no place in the spiritual roalisation according to the Śaiva faith. The position of tho Vignanakala 19</p>
<p>superior to that of Pralayakala bocause the foror has only</p>
<p>1 96.</p>
<p>one Mala oalled Anava and the latter contains two.</p>
<p>Verse 26, 27. The process of creation, according to Ma, is mentioned here. As it is already gtatod that: Paramesa, first of all, creates Ananta, Sivottama oto.. eight lords. They, through Maya create Yala tron which three classes of Tattvas proceed. In the following chart the process of the categorical development is given:</p>

<p>Verse 37. The form or the Yantra-ahosvaras is. desoribed just like the thumb (Angusthomatra) which relora to the Kala (Sakti).</p>
<p>Mr. T. mentions the number or the Mantranahesvara one hundred and eighteen and their body is mado of Mala (Cr. Kaladyarabdha Dohanami Karotyastadasadhikan, lir. T. I 4, 9). It is the aparamantrosvara olays that has abt the197.</p>
<p>body mado or Kala.</p>
<p>Verse 42, 43. The author has referred to the doctrine of Sakti-pate or divino race in the verses. T.A. has mentioned nine kinda or Sakt 1-Pate but here only threo</p>
<p>are stated,</p>
<p>The first kind of Sakti-Pata&rdquo; tiyra tivra&rdquo; cannot</p>
<p>be experienoed by a physical being. Ag soon as this Sakti comes, the Sadhaka breathes his last and is identified with Siva. In the end kind nadhyat ivra, the Sadhaka enjoys tho world ::: efter is, he deces cae viet te surans Reality. Accordin, to the third kind, called Vand ativa, the Sadhaka</p>
<p>13 inspired to obtain this Yoza and consequently is taken to a good preceptor to have a spiritual inspiration from him.</p>
<p>In the Śaiva Tantras, the divine crac. is ompha. tically declared as a meens to spiritualisa Sadhakas. Direct or indireot intervention of Sakti is entirely need ful to a geeker of truth. Diksa, a religious rito, hola as &ldquo;Significant by the Śaiva system is a Pundamental l&rsquo;actor that helps to create Sakti in the body of Sadhakas.

<p>Verges 2-7. In the verges, various Dharanas (ooncentrations), regarded as essential parts of the Tan trika Sadhana, are elaborately mentioned. The author has pointed out the process of the gradual asoent for aelr realisation. The basis of this Sadhana is the oven grades (Sapta Pramatr Bhumikas) or Sive. The names of the grades (Sakala, Pralayakala sto.) are already explained in the notes on the 16th verge or the First Ashikara.</p>
<p>It is the state or oreation and a Prematr never remains without his Salt 1. Thus in connection with thoso. Dharanas, seven Saktis with their soven Pramatrs should also be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Form (Svarupa) is also intimately associated with the Dharanas. It is the form on which a Prematr meditates. By form, we must take the essential nature or a thing. Everything, apart from its surfacial form (svarupa) has its real nature which the philosophers of the Śaiva sohool call consciousness (citi). Every object or universe, though, outwardly it may appear in various forms duo to names and appearances (nama Rupa), is, in its essence, consciousness (Cidrupa). For example, man, apart from his physical forn, 18 cit Svarupa. Similarly the earth (Prthivi) apart from its nature of dullness (Jadatva) 18 Sivasvarupa in ita essential form.</p>
<p>To take the real forn or an object in the process of Dharana is a significant element of the tantrika Sadhana</p>

<p>All these seven methods refer to differentiation regarded as the state of Matr-liana-@ya. By Pranatr, Hana and Meya, we mean Sive, Sakti and Nara respeotively.</p>

<p>To comprehend the whole poheme or tho sevou methods, it is helpful to arrange the various tattves in four groups laid dowa in descending order:</p>
<p>First group - 1. Sive, 2. Sakti, 3. Sada viva 4. Isvaratattva, s. Sudaha Vidya. This group or the five tattveg is termed as Suddha Varga. In this claus, Siva ohiefly prevails. It is also tarnaça as a puro path (Suddha ad bra) in which Siva is all in all second group. 8-Maya, from this tattva onward the impuxo road begins A bit superior to this principle is Maanaya, who has intentionally been eliminated from tho sobou tho tativas by the Malini Sobool as it plays so imporüant. 2010 11 the g&rsquo;ame.

<p>The first and the lowest method from whioh tho Sadhaka has to start, is the firteenfold method, in which the seven measurerg, their soven Saktis and the one object on which the measures with their Saktis meditate are in clad ed. For example, the earth or any other prino iple from the earth to the Prakrti is an object of meditation, which has technically been termed form (Svarupa). It is on this Svarupa that the seven Prematrs and the seven their Sakt is meditate. Thus the components of this Dharana are fifteen in number. This method is the lowest and is applied to the 4th group or beginning from the carth to the Prakrti (the whole number of the principles is twenty Pour) in ascending order.</p>
<p>In the thirteenfold method which is applicable to the third group beginning from the Kala tattva to the Purusa, there is one Svarupa or Prameya. The six Pranatrs with their Sakt is are merged in the object or Pranoya. Hence the whole number is thirteen. In this Vidhi Pralaya kala Pranata predominates and the Sakala measuror who was mainly predominating in the Pancadaca vidhi assumes the</p>

</ol>
<p>It</p>
<p>form of Meya (measurable) and his Sakti follows him. 1s trayodana vidhi.</p>
<p>In the elevenfold method the Pralayakala who was measurer in the trayod esa vidhi becomes an objpot or the med 1tation (Meya) and the vijnana Kala oocupi the form of the main Pramatr. Besides, this method is also appii cable to the Maya Tattva when it is measurable. The merger of the Pralayakala Pramata along with Sakti whiobis mana (measure) should also be understood in this viani. : *</p>
<p>Ninerold science holds the Mantra as a Main meagurer, whose Svarupa is vijnanakala with bis Sakti. Thug Vignanakala and his Sakti become one. The merging of the Vijnanakala along his sakti into Svarupa makes this Dharana, consisting of the four Pramatrs, four their Saktis and one object .</p>
<p>• Sevenfold method has one Svarupa, one Pramatr who is, mantresvara, as a chief pramatr with his Sakti. The other superior measurers also continue to follow him..</p>
<p>In the fivefold method, the Mantresvara in Svarupa or Prameya, Mantramahesvara with his Sakti and Siva with His Sakti are measurers. Thus the whole number is fiva.</p>
<p>It would not be out of place to mention here that the three methods from seven to three Vidhi, that is seven fold method, fivefold method and threefold method are pure methods as they conoern the pure &lsquo;group and therefore svarupa or Prameya in them is also pure. The measurers have to meditate on the pura Prameya (measurablo).</p>
<p>In the threefold soience, Mantramabesvara is Prameya and Siva&rsquo; with his Sakti is Pramatr. The signi floanoe of the triple Philosophy 11es in his last method</p>

<p>Verse 10.</p>
<p>The position of a Guru is very impor</p>
<p>tant in the Śaiva School of thought.</p>
<p>In most cases, he is</p>
<p>regarded as 3lve. A Sadhaka cannot attain the status of Parama Siva in the Supreme state, unless he is uiried with the Sakti. The latter cannot be united with the former if a preooptor does not help him. For the process of libera tion, Guru, Dixga and Salt 1-Pata aro indispendable. These threo faotors are interrelated.</p>
<p>The significance of the Quru lies in the fact that ho purifies the physical being of an aspirant by Sadhani Diksa, In the pure selr or the Sadhaka, Sakti enters and helps the preceptor to transform the Sadheka into suprema</p>
<ol start="204">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>ieality by means of Yojani diksa.</p>
<p>In some cases, without the help of the human guru a Sadhaka is directly transformed to the state of Supreme Reality. Due to these rere cases, we should not under</p>
<p>egtimate the high status of Guru. This sort or spiritua lisation of a Sadhaka must be taken as preceded by the divine Guru that is siva. In any case, the high position of the Guru cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Verse 17. The term &lsquo;Rudra Sakt 1gamavesa implies the well-know doctrine of Sakti-pata understood as essen tial key for self-realisation throughout the school of Śaiva Sadhana. According to Sa iva canons, one Siva appears as many by means of his own free will.</p>
<p>omes</p>
<p>Ag inrinito Siva is rinitised by his own freedom, similarly He becomes infinite from his finite forms by his own Sakti. According to the Salva canons, the freedom or</p>
<p>Svantantrya Sakti of Siva plays a double role. In both</p>
<p>cases, one Sakti is called by two different names. When it abgourates the essential nature of siva, and makes him &amp; Pasu (animal) it 18 Roddhri Sakti. The other Sakti is termed vikesini or Santa, due to which the Pasu or the bound (Baddha) is transformed to the state of Supreme</p>
<p>Reality.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Śaiva Scheme of Liberation, nc Sadhaka is enabled to attain the status or Siva State,</p>
<p>unless the Sakti intervenes and helps him in his spiritua 11sation.</p>
<p>This intervening of Sakti or Sakt 1-Pata oan appear in a Sadhaka of an impuro and puro state. Ma., for the appearance of Sakti, has collectively mentioned five states or a su. and Su-Adhva. A Sad hala of the state of Panou</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>Mahabhuta, tattvas, atman, mantra and Sakti can be unified with the Balti oalled *Santa&rsquo; and hence the Sastra has classified the Rudra Sakti Samavesa into &lsquo;Tive kinds, which aga in are arranged into Subdivisions.</p>

<li>In the verse previous to this 18th verse, the entrance (Samavesa) or the Siva-Sakti is describ ed as it has five kindg. The five kinds are also mentioned there. Objections is raiged that the separate mention or , the Sakti Samavesa serves no purpose, because, all the Tattvas Bhuta etc. fall under the categories, therefore, only one Samavesa 1.6., Tattva Samavesa will surrice. In the word tattva&rsquo; all these separately mentioned tattvas are included. The objection is removed. By the separate mention of these tattvas, the author means to lay emphasis on the principles and show their primary importance in the</li>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Samavesa.</p>
<p>Bes 10 as, the other point of objeotion is the mention of the thirty kinds of the tattya Şamavosa as the Tattvas are thirty. In the philosophy of Trika, thirty six tattvas are mentioned everywhere. The mention of the thirty tattvas 1g curious when the number of the prino iples in this philosophy is thirtysir. Malini is 81lent on this objection. The Matrka school of Abiinava Gupta has dis cussed this question in the 13th A or T.A. To know the essence of the thirty categories, all of them are arranged in the three groups viz. Pure group from Siva to Suddha Vidya, pure and impure group, Mayatattva only and the third</p>
<p>impure group from Kala to earth. In the first group, there are five tattvas, 1&hellip; Siva Sakti Sadasiva, lavara. Tattva and Buddha-Vidya which are the five aspects of one ultimate principle, Siva, who has been regarded as full of five Saktis (Penoa Sakti Sun ir bhara T.A. 9th A, 49) siva</p>
<ol start="208">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>is divided as fivefold by keeping His rive funotions in view. These five functions oorrespond to the tive prin oiples, 1.e. 31va, Sakt 1, sto. T.A. 9th A.V.50. Thus thi. division is dependent on the primary nature of the functions of Siva who in reality, is one, full of Saktis and beyond the tattvas (tattvatita).</p>
<p>The second group is Maya, which has been mentioned 28 Maya Sakti of siva and 1s identical with Him (Tadavya tirekini). It is the part and parcel of Siva and is oited as all-pervasive indivisible (Niskala) the cause of the universe and everlasting (Ma. 1st. Adh.). 26. Thus this Maya tattva does not have individual entity and hence it has been included in the Sakti of siva (Siva-Sakt yavina Bhavat) T.A. 9th A.152. .</p>
<p>Maya Tattve has also two aspects, 1.. its baleno ed state (Samavestha) and un balanced state (Vigamat&rsquo;agtha) Meya in its un balanced state, i.e. when it is disturbed (Ego bhama panna) creates the universe (T.A. 9th A.V. 158). Maya is also not counted as Tattva on the basis of its : balanced state, which is part and parcel of the nature of</p>
<p>Siya,</p>
<p>The third group, in which the thirty tattvas, from Kala to Prthivi are included, as a matter of fact, is the real number of the principles. The author has, kept this idea in view and therefore, he has mentioned as the thirty kinds or the tattva Samavesa.</p>
<p>Verse 21, 22, 23. In the Śaiva sohool of Philosophy the three means or upayas, viz. Anava. (Anava &amp; amavęsa) Sakti (s aktasamavosa) and Sambhava (Sambhava Samavesa) upayas aro prosoribed for the three classes of the Sadhakas. The Upayas aro entirely based on the three207.</p>
<p>states of Sadhana. The lowest state, called Anava, totally oonnooted with the puryestaka. In the State, Sadhaka stabilisee himself on the objects of materiality. He takes senses, body and other physioal things as congo ious</p>
<p>In Anava state, these objects are understood as cittųttva&rsquo;. Psychophysical complex or hiva (arirendriya) is supreme Reality. In short the ampir 10al experiene. predominates in the State.</p>
<p>The basis of the Sakta State is mind regarded as the ground of doubts or Vikalpas (Cinta Avastha). It is a state of mind and totally dirfers from the previous one where in body and senses are primary. The Sadhaka of the state tries to rise from this mental plane but doubte</p>
<p>(Vikalpas) oocupy him and he remains in the wavering position. The state, preceding to it, was entirely objective. It is the balanced state of subject and object. Neither subjective unity nor objective plurality stays&rsquo;</p>
<p>permanently.</p>
<p>Sen bhava olaas implies the state, free from all dounts, (Cinta Suya avastha). It is the stato of subjce tive Reality, to some extent, it resembles the objectless tranca (nirvikalpa Samadhi).</p>
<p>In short, the bases of the anava Salta and Sambhava Upaya ara body, mind and moul (Atna).</p>
<p>For self-realisation, a Sadhaka or an objective state should adopt the anavo paya in which all the physical meang suon as Vegara, Karane, Dhyana, Varna and sthana&rsquo;are primarily included.</p>

<p>208</p>
<p>Patanjala school of Yoga. Sva, T. also has stregsed the</p>
<p>pranasamcara method as means for self-knowledge and stated 1ts process in connection with Diksa.</p>
<p>By Vocara, we mean to have control over the various movements or the five winds (Vayu) called &ldquo;Prana, apana, samana, Udana&rsquo; and &lsquo;Vyana&rsquo; which &rsquo;exist in the human miorocosm. A Sadhaka of an objeotive state should try to lead his prana Vayu upwards and check the downward tendenoy of the Apanavayu. After controlling conflicting movements of prana anda pana, the Sadhaka has to stay on the Samana Vayu, a symbol of balance. From this normal state onwards simultaneously twofold erfort is needful. The Sadhaka should continue his labour upwardly and Inwardly till he reaches from &lsquo;udana to vayana, a mark of the all pervasivo and subjeotive Reality.</p>
<p>Besides, one has to bear in mind the conception of Kaladhvan with which vacakadhvan (varna-mantra-padas)</p>
<p>is closely associated. The torm, uocara, also prints out that a Sadhaka of the anava olass should start hia Sadhana from pada mantra and varna gradually to achieve a supreme goal of life.</p>
<p>Karana. The second term included in the anavo paya is Karana, which simply and literally means a medium, a device or a Sadhana to obtain something. Abhinaval Gupta has teohnically explained the term and olassiried it</p>

<p>a buddha which is technically tormed as Jagrat Jagrat, Buddha (Lit. known) 18 oalled (Jagrat svapnal Prabuddha (Lit. speo ially knowa) is called Jagrat Susupta and the fourth is suprabuddha (Lit. absolutely known). It should be noted hors that the Turya (tho fourth state) is not combined with the Jagrat avastha (Jagrat Turya) in adoor dance with s. s.v.su 230 (Tripuoaturtham Tallavadasebayan, which means that the fourth stato (Turya), is mixed with the aforesaid three states 11ko o11.</p>
<p>In the dreaming state (Svapna) the mental trend of the Sad haka is not towards the material objects. He does not hold them as real (Bahyabh imata Bhavanem Ayagra hanam, T.A. 10th. A com. 254). In this stato Pramana (Measura) stands pre-eminently and various mental tendenoios begin to come to an end. The state or non-differentiation rises and the Yogi proceeds towards the balance of mind</p>
<p>The other names of the state ar Padastha and Vyapti. This state has algo four kinds, viz. gatagata (Lit. going and con ing) somet Inos nental balance goes away and sometime comes baok. Technically 1t is termed as &ldquo;Svapna Jagrat, Suviksipta (Lit. voll.&rdquo; thrown) 1.0. mind is devoted to the full balanced state called Svapna-Svapna, Sangata (Lit, the mixing up of the mind with its balano od state) 19 Svapna Susupta and tho</p>
<p>fourth kind 18 susamahita (Lit. perfeotly balanced) which has been named as a Svpne-Turya&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the dreamless sleep state (Susupta) the Pramatr (measurer) sees the exterior obfoots indifferently. There is no total ond or these as it is in the fourth state (Turya) (Natu Turya Dasayamiva Sarvatovigalan am (T.A.loth A Com. 262). The Prameya (measurable) and Pramana arol: thrown into a background and measures occupies the Primary</p>

<p>position (Bukhya Matradasa Seyam) T.A.loth. 260). The other two names of this state are Rupastha and Mahavyapti. The four kinds of this state ares- uaita (Lit. risen), which 19 said to be &lsquo;Sugupta Jagrat&rdquo;, Vipula (Lit. Great) the Technical name or which is &lsquo;Susupta Svapna&rsquo; Santa (Lit. Calm) whioh is regarded as Susupta Susupta and the fourth, kind is suprasanna (Lit. well pleased) which has been termed ag &lsquo;Susupta-Turya&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the fourth state (turya), the object, suporior to the Pramatr is sxperienced. The object is inclined to bring the supreme perreotion to itself. The form is not perfoot yet. The high spiritual journey is st 111 required. Though this stage is not the highest and final one yet it is totally different from Prameya, Pramana and Pranatr&rdquo; (T.A. 10th, 266). Thor, is the total disappearance of all dis-appo intments. The state can be said to be as Sakti. Samavega&rsquo; (T.A.l0th 265).</p>
<p>All the differentiations of Meya, Mans and pra matr disappear and hence it is called quito calm but not as calm as the Turiyatita is (T.A. 10th. 871). The other names or this state are Pradaya (Lit. Gathering, 1.0., the whole universe seems united and hence heterogeniety goes : away) and Rupatita (Lit. beyond the form, 1.0., the state of Paragakti). Unlike the other states, 1t is divided into three kinds, viz., Manomanam (Lit. when mind leaves aside its main action) and wanders to and fro which 1s neationed as &ldquo;Turya Jagrat&rsquo;. In Ananta, there 18 the want or stability in mind attached to so many places and objeots. It is technically called as &ldquo;Turya Svapne and the third kind is Sarvarth (all the world stands as the form of Sakti) as &ldquo;Turya Susupta&rsquo;. - The fourth kind, such as Turya-Turya cannot be possible in this state because the Samvit</p>
<p>214..</p>
<p>(Consciousness) is not knowable (Vedya). It stands in the form of a knower and shines independently (T.A.l0th 275).</p>
<p>Thefifth state, i.e., Turyatita (Beyond the fourth) 1s perfoot, independent and full or bliss. It is</p>
<p>is said to be Parana Pada&rsquo; (the highest).</p>
<p>Keeping in view, the comon man&rsquo;, the Yogi and Jaanin, the author has mentioned the other names or the four states but this state has only two names, Turyat ita, commonly used, and Maha Prabaya used by Jnanis. It is. the pure state of consciousness and therofore no Yobio Name is used for it as all nød itationa (Bhavanas) como to an end horo. (T. A$ 10th. 279). There is perfeot spali gation in it and hence only one Inanio name &lsquo;Maha Pragaya</p>

<p>already stated that the froe will of Siva is regarded as a source of all creation. The author has named it as looha&rsquo; and it is said to be an und ifferentiated form of the universe of phenomena and lotters. This Iooha represent ing unity, assumes its two forms called &lsquo;Inana and Kr&rsquo;lya&rsquo; gaktis, in the state or creation. Both, Jnana and Kriya are evolutions of fooha. The former represents the interior state of differentiation while the latter is externalised form of looha. These three states correspond to Para Sakti, Mahamaya or Su-Vidya and Maya. From the other point of view, the states also represent Para Nada, Nada and Matrka. In faot; 1t 1s Matrka or Maya from which letters are originated.</p>
<p>In this conneotion we should also take the Mantra to whom Siva has entrusted the work or creation, into consideration. The Ananta creates all letters a ho hears in the Nada Stato (Tatsamangrutin varnan Tatsanichya nasrjat prabhuh, M.III. 27).</p>
<p>As Icoha has two forms, similarly Matrka algo consists of two forms, viz., vowels and consonants corres pond ing to Vija and Yoni respectively.</p>
<p>Both Vija and Yoni represent &ldquo;Avikirna Avastha&rdquo; (State of non-radiation. It is the state or radiation when Vija and Yoni develop into sixteen vowela a, a, 1, i eto. and Kavarga cavarga eto., groupinga, respeotively.</p>

<p>Por detail, let us mention that all the Mantrag laro made of the vowels and consonants regarded as repro Bentative of the seed (Vija) and Yoni or Siva and Sakti respeotivaly. Accord ing to the Matrka school, a11 letters reprosent themselves as Sakti from which thirtysix</p>
<p>tattvas spring up.</p>
<p>. The twentyfive tattvas from Prthivi (earth) to Purusa owe their origin to the twentytive consonants from Ka to Ma, i.e., to say, the five Mahabhutas (material or gross elements), viz., barth, water, light, air and other, are the results of creation from Ka to Ma. The five tanmatras (substances or @gsenosa), viz., sound, contact colour, savour and odour spring respectively from oa to na. The creation of the five Karmondriyac (organ or action), viz., voice, hands, feet and the organs or the exoret ion and generation, is due to the five consonants from ta&rsquo; to &rsquo;na&rsquo; respectively. The five consonants from &rsquo;ta&rsquo; to &rsquo;na&rsquo; &lsquo;give rise to the five Buddhindriyas (organs of peroeption), 1.9., the car, the skin, tho eyes the tongue and the noro Tho flvo principles 1&hellip; Manas (mind) Ahankara (self-arrogation) Buddhi (intellect) Prakrti and Purusa (selr) como out of tho rive letters from Pa to Me respeotively. The four tattvas 1.0. Paga (limitation in ragard to interest lit. attachment) Vidya (limited Imowledge) the kala (the power of imited creation) and Maya (the generally limiting power) proceed from the consonants, Ya, ra, la and va. The five letters viz., Sa, Sa, Sa, and Ha rexpresent the five tattvas 1.. Mahamaya (graat 1llusion). Suddha vidya (truo or puro knowledge) Isvara tattva (Lit. Lordi iness) Sadasiva and Sakti, respectively. Thus Siva is not considered as oategory. Some of the Śaivas include Siva also in the oategory and arop down the Maha Naya as a tattva.</p>
<ol start="224">

</ol>
<p>The oreat lon of the univeras, consisting of the Tattvas above mentioned, is based on the Matrkas from</p>
<p>a to na and rinds its source in a which is all transcend ing Parama Siva of the nature or bliss and all complete in Finsolr. This a&rsquo; is the Parama slve, who is technically termed as Anuttara&rsquo; in the 3 aiva literature</p>
<p>or Kashmir..</p>
<p>Philosophically and gramatically vowels are in dependent sounds and have their primary importance in the formation of nearly all the consonants. For instance, the consonants of the Ka, on, pa, ta and ta series boing serially the developed forms of &quot; &ldquo;1&rdquo; &quot;</p>
<p>u r ! and Ir and like them gutturals palatals, labials, oerebrals and and dental respootively. Similarly &lsquo;ya&rsquo; and 8a are but developed forms or &lsquo;ca&rsquo;Ra and Sa or Ta Le and Sa or Ta; va of ta and pa combined, and &ldquo;ha&rsquo; is the developed form or visarga. In short, the miverso is an aggregate of the Matrkas from &lsquo;a&rsquo; to &lsquo;hall and may be traced &lsquo;a&rsquo; ag its source. In tantraloka sistosun Rudras are mentioned as the representatives of the sixteon vowels but among them &lsquo;a&rsquo;, whion is. Parara Sival! or Anuttara as it 18 termed, has been laid stress on. It is this anuttara or &lsquo;a&rsquo; in which all the other lotters have their source. Thus the wholo material universo or the Matrkas begins from the a&rsquo; which is &lsquo;a symbol of transcend ing 3iva and the universo created by this &lsquo;a&rsquo; represents the sakti aspeot or imanental aspeot of the game all-pervading prinoiple. In the end the mystery of Siva and Sakti is found in the lotter &ldquo;ka, which is but a combination of &lsquo;kall the developed form or &lsquo;a&rsquo; or the Anuttara and &lsquo;sa&rsquo; tho dovoloped form or Visarga or Sakti.

<p>The term &lsquo;Yoga&rsquo; is used in its literal</p>
<p>TE</p>
<p>sense and meang unirication of something with the other.</p>
<p>Verse 7. Simply Dikaa or initiation is a Tantrika rite, which purges a Sadhaka of his taints, imparts purification to his self and equips him for self realisation. Sometimes this self-purification (Atna Sanskara) comes from Sive who by his own free will, infuses Sakti into a Sadhaka and brings hin to the status of Supreme Reality</p>
<p>Guru is an important factor in diksa. It is Guru who initiates his pupil and imparts hin Sakti. By the awakening or Sakti the Sadhaka gets himself liberated.</p>
<p>Thus both, Guru and Sakt 1-Pata, are specially assooiated with the Diksa rito.</p>
<p>Diksa is divided into two divisions. Jnana and Kriya diksa. The former is conneoted with budahi ot intellect and purges a Sadhake of his bauddha ajuana (intelleotual taints). The latter is assooiated with spirit or salt and removes the Paurusa afnana or the ignoranoo related to spirit. According to the Śaiva!. Aganas, 1t is a fact that no Sadhaka la identaried with the227.</p>

<p>Bhuvanas are a part of sixtola road technically called &lsquo;Sadad hran&rsquo; whion is a ivided into two heads viz. Vacakadhvan and Vapyadhvan. Every one of thean from the Trika point of view, is olassified into three divisions 1.6. Sthula, Suksam and Pera (Cross, subtlo and beyond subtle). As regards the Vadakad bvan, it&rsquo; consists or Varna, Mantra and pada, symbolised as Moya Mana and Matr, corresponds from the Trika point of view, to siva, Bakti end nara. Similarly the Vaayadhvan also consists of Kala tattva and bhuvana, understood as three different ways for self-realisation, and corresponds to the para, sukama and</p>

<p>One hundred and eighteen Bhuvanas mentioned in the 5th Adhikara aro distributed among the four andas referred to in the socond Adhi, of Me. To every one of four andas, Parthiva, Prakrta, Maya and Sakta, tour Kalas, called Nivrtti, Prat istha, Vidya and Santa are allottod, respootively.

<p>the four andas (andadhistata) called Brahma, Vienu, Rudra and Isvara, masters or Bhuvanag (Bhuvanesa) are specially referred to in T.A.</p>
<p>As regards the differezo0 between the masters of andas (Andadhistata) and the masters of the Bhuvanas (Bhuvanesa), the former are inferior to the lattor. The class or bhuvanegas has twofold body called Mayio (made or maya) and va indava (a body consisting or maya as voll as or Su-Vidya) doha. It is the latter quality due to which Bhuvanesas have divya Jnana (divino lowledgo). By this Jnana, they can initiate their servants (Prerya) and can work as Guru but this capao ity leoks in the masters of the andas (andadhistatr) because they are not above the level or Maya. Their body is also Haya-made. They are totally devoid of the contact or su-Vidya Whioh is a main faotor to bring the Bhuvanesas to the status or superiority.</p>

<p>SIXTH ADHIKARA.</p>
<p>NOTES.</p>
<p>In the wholm adhikara, anganyasa, a religious rite, is treated in detail. In general, it is connected with all the religious ceremonies of India and in partit cular it is understood as most important part or the Śaiva rites. The first neosssary stops which a spiritual socker has to take aro Bhuta-Sudahi obtainablo through anganyasa.

<p>Verga 8-B.. When a Sadhaka has to redoivo the in it iation of knowledge, he is advised to consider all the prinoiples in his own body (niorocoam) for the purpose. The Sadhaka und er initiation is ordered to perfor various Anganyasas which have been mentioned according to the threefold method, vis., Apara V1021. Parapara viani and Para Vidhi wh loh point out thro. Philosophies of Dualien, dualisms non-dualism and non-dualiw, respectively. As already mentioned all Tantrik Sadhanas begin from obvious and gross substances and co up to subtlo ones. The Sadhaka has to nod itate on thirty six tattvas in his own body which has the measure of eightyfour fingers, from feet to rore. head. Thus he begins his Ange Myaga from Dhara Tattva in feet to Sadasiva tattva in the forehead. Thus the remain ing two prinoiples that is Sakti and Siva aro supposed as porvading the whole body and are eliminated from the thirtysix principles. All those tattvas are sllustratea Oin tho Sadtr insat tattva Nyasa Vidhi in the following: -</p>

<p>LICHTE ADHIKARA.</p>
<p>The Chapter contains all tho particuları or a Sadha aiksa with whion the dootrine or prata or wahaprota is olosely associated. The conooption pf this doctrino can be explained in two ways. Firstly, the Śaiva Sohool or Thought resoen ises everything as real because 16 18 tho dovelopment or 010 Sakti, understood as an eagontial nature of the Suprono Reality. Take any object of the</p>
<p>universe and it is accord lng to the system, an evolution of Sakti. Ir 1t is devoid or Sakti, the School will certainly regard it as a corpse (3ava). From the Salta point or view, everything is Sakti. Ir it is without, it, it is as good as a dead body is .</p>
<p>The second implication or tho doctrina is that a seeker of truth, in his gradual 230ent, should trans oend overy thing and roach tho Supzone Reality. According to this process, as the system mentions, after the Suddha Vidye, the realm of the siva State bogins, ordinarily. this state is divided into thrse divisions, Isvara, sada Siva and Siva. A spiritual Sadhete, for the attainment or tho Siva State, which is regarded as a pormanent seat or cit Sakti, should transcend the Ievará and the Sadasiva. In view of tho 9 lva state, both, Isvara and Sadan iva atatou are said to be dead or prata and nahaprota zospa ivoly, as they have no olt Sakti 12 them. The point vosth noting is that the syetem doon not believe in these two atatoe as the Supreme State. Both of them, from the Satta yoint or view, have been rogarded as a coryse because they are devoid or Sakti. The votaries or Bakti do not hesitate to regard von Siva ea doad 11 36 19 dovoia of Sakt.

<li>Origin of Tantras - Tantras are mainly derived from the Aramas which have been understood, 11ka the Vedas, revelations. They are orally handed down from teachers to pupils. The traditional account of their origin, aocording to the Śaiva School of Kashmir, is that all the Sastras, in their unmanifested state rema in latent in the All-transcending Para Vak or Supreme Logos, which, in fact, is a supreme will of Siva. It iu tho suprome state of oneness wheroin no differentiation: or any kind is experienced. As soon as the manifestation or universe begins, the undifferentiated state of the Para Vek is a isturbed. As result of this the second state &lsquo;or the supreme atato or pasyanti in whiob for the first time, seeds of differentiation appear. The third stato of the Para Sakti is inadhyama wh loh refers to the inner develop nent of differentiation, All our sastras remain stored in this state. Through sone mediu, they appear in the Vaikhari Vak. In the madhyama state, only atma (wolf). of man can know them. The state is out of the human approach. All Sastras partioularly Śaiva Sastras as the tradition mentions, owe their origin to the Madhyama stato which flows out as Vaikhari Vak in tivo streams (panon: grotas), regarded as rive faces of Siva. The rivo facen,</li>
</ol>
<p>viz. Isana, Tatpurusa, Sadyo jata, Aghora and Vama, ropre pont rive aspects, ait, Ananda, Iooha, Juana and Iriya,</p>
<p>which are deeply 8800 iatad with the rive functions, viz., emanation (8rst1), maintenance (sthiti), destruction (Samhara), sono salment (vilaya) and dispensation of grao</p>
<p>(anugraha), or Siva. AB T.A. mentione, all the Sastres that stream forth from the five races are sixty four and Tapresent various aspects of philosophy. As soon as the Kali are approaches Śaiva Sastras begin gradually to dis</p>
<p>uppear with the gradual disappearance of the sages taught them. Due to the disappearance of the Sastras</p>
<p>the whole world is engrossed in spiritual darkness. Siva, on seeing these natural consequences of the dis appearance of Sastras, takes pity on men and appears on Kailasa mountain in the form of Srikantha. Ho commanded the sage Durvagas to propagate the knowledge of the Salva Sestras in the world again. The sage, thus commanded, created, by the power or his mind, three sons, Tryambaka, Amardaka and șrinatha. He oharged them with the mission of establishing spiritual order and or teaohing man again the ancient Śaiva faith and the Trika dootring in its : three aspects of unity (Abheda), diversity (Bhedat and University-in-diversity (Bhedabhoda). It 16 Txy au baka who was first taught to spread a bheda (unity) dootrine among then. The second dootrina of bheda (diversity) was entrusted to the second son, Amardake. The third son Srinatha was appointed for the propagation of the tenets of Bhad a bheda (unity-in-diversity).</p>
<p>The orthodox account mont loned above is based on &lsquo;Kashmir Shalvimm.. by 1.0.Chatterjee, who has followed Abhinava Gupta, the author of Tantraloka. As a matter or faot, Jayaratha, the commentator of Tantraloka, com anting on the following verse, has elaborately wluoidated the origin of the saiya Tantras from the riro races of the</p>
<p>Lord:</p>

<p>.. Tantrika conooption of Sadhana - The aim of human striving, according to tantrag and Vedas, 1s the attainment of the Suprema State where all diversitesi come to an end. But their approach to this destination, is dirferont. The obvious reason of this difference is their conception. The conception or Tantras is totally dirrerent from that of the Vedas, The Vedio culture believes in the Mantra-3 adhana as a means to self-roali: gation. In this respect, the attitude or the Tantrika cult is different. It has gone a pace forward. The analyy is or letters is a pooullarity of the Tantrika culture and it lays strags on them as devices for the achievement of self-knowledge.</p>
<p>.: Tantrika approach to the Supreme Reality is absolutely dirferent from that of the Vedas and the Vedanta. It is chiefly based on the conception of the Supreme. Tantrikas believe in the immanenoe and the transcendence of the Roality. Their sadhana begins from the gross objets understood as symbolle forms of the Supreme Principle. A Sadhaka, first, has to identify himselr with the objeot he is meditating on. After ti Gending this gross object, he has to unify his self with the universal self. Accord ing to the Tantrika Sohool, the Supreme Reality is both, visvamaye (immanent) and visvottirna (transcendent). The advaita Vedantie con coption of the Supreme Selr is transcendent. To this system, the empirical reality has no meanings. In the Vadas, there is no set conception of tho &lsquo;supree. The tantrika oonception is based on - sivo bhutva Bivam yajet.</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Tantras bellevo in the sakti Prinoiple and there fore their Sadhana is secret as distinguished from the</p>
<p>Vedio Sadhana wh 10h is quite open.The theory of motion (Karman) has great impor tance in the tantrika cult. After tho Identification or the limited self with the universal Boul, actions do not cease. The conception of the Supreme Self, according to Tantras, is balanced state of jnana and kriya. In the supreme state this kriya Sakti in the form of cit sakti</p>
<p>remains xotivo.</p>
<p>The congeption of the Supreme Reality, according to the Vedic and the poet Vedio thought, is conso iousness. After the attainment of the supreme state, all aotions cease because that stato represents the domination of</p>
<p>supreme consciousness.</p>
<p>Arter the self-assimilation of the rinite with tho infinite, all upasanas (worshipe) on the part of the former come to an end accord ing to the school of Vedanta. But the case in the Tantrika system is different. Even after the self-assimilation or the individual with the supreme self, the upasanas (worships) on the part of the former continue, in the form of Suprema Sakti.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Iraportance of Tantras - At the very outset,</li>
</ol>
<p>the study of Tantras reaiinds us of tho uno 1v1lis ed agos. or India. Critios do not hesitate to regard them as a olaas of literature, having &rsquo;little sense in much nonsense&rsquo; All this is due to the Western languages in which they are translated and interpreted. A language in whioh the work is not originally written cannot convey the true sense of the work. Th18 &lsquo;underestimate of the Tantrik philosophy has been continuing for a long time and the study of the Tantrag has been throw out of the literary oirala. It 18 on account of the fruitful orrorts of Sir Johan Wood roore and Atalvihary Chona who are loading figures of the &ldquo;Agama Anu-Sandhana Samiti&rdquo; that the Tantras have come to</p>
<ol start="5">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>bo considered as an important part of literature. Now they are regarded as a storehouse of Indian-aoultism.. The oocult side of the Tantras is soientifio and resembles, hypnotiam and fascination, whion are considered NOW &lsquo;Thought&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Tho Brahma anical literature of India dan bo divided into Srut 1 smrti, Purana and Agama. The Tantras are main] derived from Agama Sastra but some of them, in part ar. also based on the Puranas. They are useful in present state or flux prevailing in the Kali age. The Vedio ritual does not suit the present age. Man or to-day has no longer oupacity, longevity and moral strength to carry out the Ved 10 Karma Kanda. Thus the Tantra Sastra presents the Vedio truth, in a wodelled form suitable to the infirmities and the charaoteristics of this age.</p>
<p>Like the Srutis, Tantras have two ends or human life to rulr11, viz., Abhyudaya (progress) and Nih Sreyas&rsquo; (Liberation). Their mothods and ways vary accord ing to the human taatos, environments, needs and 1n011 nations. In fundamentals and methods, they airtor from the six schools of India but in essence, they resouble tham and raprosent their monistio philosophy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some fundamental dootrines of tantras.</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) Hinduism is a combination of various olasses or men and accommodatea mon or different temperaments in its fold. On this basia, five olassos or Tantras, Salva, Sakti, Vaisnaya, Saura (related to the worship or Surya) and Canapatya (related to anapati) are formed in the Hindu gor iptures and they prasoribe different forms of practice. It is a singular distinotion of the Brahmapioal literature that it recognises the fact that all men sannot</p>
<p>reach that ultimate goal by one method. On the ground that men vary in temperaments and various other ways, they aro classiried under thrsa hoads, viz., men of divine disposition (Divya Bhava) heroio disposition (vira Bhava (and animal disposition (Pasubhava). These forma (Bhuvas) are important factors in the process or Sadhana and on them the competency of an aspirant for any particular kind of practio. depends. All classes of Sadhakas, first of all, have to subdue six enemies - lust, anger, greed, pride 11lusion and envy. These three dispositions (Bhavas) mentioned in other Tantras corres pond to the three Upayas (errorts) 1.6. Sambhava Upaya, Saktopaya and Anava Upayas or T.A. and Ma. II.</p>
<p>In connection with the dootrine of &lsquo;Bhaya(Natura and disposition) referred to above, we should not forget the view of Sarvananda, a celebrated writer of sarrollasa tantra published by Sri Raja Mohan Chalcravarti. The special forte or the author in his Tantra, 1s laid on threefold Bhava and the corresponding Acara. No doubt, the dootrine or Bhava is one of the knotty problem of the</p>
<p>The author has la 10 nuob&rsquo; emphasis on the oxplanation or the term &lsquo;Bhava&rsquo; in the 7th Ullas and mentioned it as one supremo existence which multiplios</p>
<p>itself in various forms (of. Eka sva nahan bhavo nanatyam bhajat ipriye, 8.U.T. 6th u). As a matter of fact the supreme congoiousness appears in the three torns, 1.0., Pagu bhava, Vira bhara and Divya bhaya, which, in a simple language, are the three states of the payahia: principle in the universo. Accord ing to Sarvananda, the ritual, prescribed for the lowest state (animal) is or&hellip; also three kinds 1.6. Pagu-acara, Vaisnavacara and Śaivacara. Similarly, the author of this Tantra has also mentioned the suba ivisions of thre. chieftates</p>
<p>1n his work. The remarkable point is that the hero lo state or vira bhava is refleoted in the three sucoegaive cults called daksinasara, vamaoara and sidhantacara. In both olasses of devotees, that is daksiuacara and vamacara, dualism reigns supreme. The third olags is absolutely</p>
<p>identical with Siva himself and points out monisi.</p>
<p>. The dootrine or bhava mentioned in the 8th Ullas is speo ially related to the three olasses of men, Pasu Vira and Divya, who are to be admitted into tho spiritual realisation according to the Tantrika Sadhana.. The lowest olass of men whom Tantras doolare to be Pagu&rsquo; has been advised to regpeot all female olars as mother. Though this lowest olass in form, is man but in nature it is Pasu (animal). Sometimes it 18 also regarded as a child. because it, like a ohild, does not understand its naturo whloh, au a matter of fact, is not different from the nature of supreme reality. For this sort of a Sądhaka, Tantras preach Vatrka Upasana (nother worship). He should regard all prakrti, specially all women as mother. Only those peraons who have infused the idea of motherhood into : all classes of women, are admitted as spiritual aspirants asoord ing to the Tantrika way of realisation. We must remember that almost all Tantras lay much emphasis on this point and respect women as a mother. Sha, in any case is never thought as a thing of animal gratification. &lsquo;sho is a mother and she should be regarded as mother till the Sadhaka passes from the lowest stage or Pasubhava from which the Tantrika Sadhana bagian. Thus those persons, who desire to rise spiritually, should obey the regulations or the Tantrika philosophy and work accordingly. In ahort, in the Pasubhava a Sadhaka, who is beginnar, should cultivate the idea of motherhood or Prakrti, Maya and Sakti in his mind. He is just like a child in the hand</p>
<p>of a mother.</p>
<p>Sad hakas or heroio state are superior to those of animal state. They are no more children in the hands of a mother. They have subdued the Prakrti, Maya and Sakti and have got a full control over all sorts or nature. They can lead ft to whatever side thay desire.</p>
<p>The nature becomas submissive to this class or 3adhakas. The feature of this olass and the class vention ed above is that both precoh the idea of airference and hence they are regarded as dualistio&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The third olass, 1.6., Divya bhava, is that when the nature is fully identified with the Sadhaka, The 100g as Prakarti, Maya and Sakti totally disappears. It is a supreme State and is hardly distinguished from the &ldquo;Kaula Avastha&rsquo; mentioned in Tantraloka. The gradual attainment or this state is the aim of Tantram and they lay nuoh stresa on this point but sometimes this gradual asoont. is not compulsory. An aspirant or Pasu bhava class can obtain the position of a ivya bhava by the high quantity of Sakti pata. Thus a gradual as well as a sudden rise. depends on the quantity of Sakt 1-Pata, which, accord ing to Salva school, intervenøs in the acts of spiritualisation. Besides one central point, which has been laid straga upon by all Advaita Indian philosophies, 18 self-roall nation. The way of sell realisation mentioned by sarvolla -9atantra is fuller than that of the Sankara Vedanta. The knowledge of the sair oannot be complete unless the com prehensive knowledge of the nature (Prakrti) 15 fully obtained (or. Ajnstva Prakrtim devin Brahma-Jaane Karoti Yah Vrtha Jaanam Bhavatta ya Klivasyalinganan Yatha 3,0.1.0.62). We have no ground to doubt the words of Sarvananda, because the crent Sankaradarya benato awarce.</p>
<p>or the fut 111ty or his Brahma jnana and turned a worshipper or Sakti which appears in the three forms, viz., Sukuma, Jyoti and 8thula or Para, Parapara and Apara, aduota ing to Sarvollagatantra and Tantraloka or Abhinava Gupta respectively. This representation of Sakti in the three forms reminds us of women in various colours to whom the Tantrika &lsquo;Sadhakas pay great respeot as mothers. The obvious reason of this esteen paid to Sakti sono option is that the Tantrika philosophy has been found ed on it. The importano a of this principle by which the Tantrika Philosophers can solve the knotty problem of the world creation, cannot be denied. There 18 a perfect barmony in the three forms of Sakti which the Tantrika saints of dirrerent temperaments praotise.</p>
<p>The discovery of a secret universe in our own body is remarkable in the philosophy of Tantray and vo must regard it as a great achievement of the Tantrika seot of India. The elaborate mention or the physioal Yoga in the Tantra-Sastras represents, as a matter of fact, the inner ritual and has been followed by all the religious sects of to-day in India. Varying ways or initiation teach the Tantrika Sadhaka the spirit of solt-surrender and enable them to realis. the union of siva and Bakti. It is the Tantrika sago who comes to know whatovar is, within him also exists without him. The inner and the outor universes ar, not two separate things for the Tan trika Sadhakas. They are one. It is the external worla by whioh the Tantrika gaints oan comprehend the soorsts lying in the inner universe. It is the peouliarity of the Tantrika sadhana that it tries to meet the supreme Reality by the physioal means. The laner Kowledge cannot be complete unless it is obtained through the physioal means (or. Vyakte Jhapan Finn biedrs gupta Joana na Isyato:</p>
<p>S.U.T.U. 58).</p>
<p>(b) Likewisa olosely connected with thes. Bhavas (a isposition) thoro are seven Acaras (Rules of conduot): Veda, Vaisnava, Salya, Dakgina, Vama, sida hanta and Kaula. (Ku. 1. Cha. II). An aspirant should rise to the highest reality gradually through these soven stages of the conduct. In the first atago, ho ought to oultivate physical and mental olganlines.&rsquo; This purifloation of body as well as of mind is essential to all sorts of religious and spiri tual olevation. Eo should learn the art of devotion, which is an essence of Vaisnayacara in the second stage. In the third stage, he must acquire the knowledge of the universal self and individual self whion 19 a chief symbol of Salvadare. In the fourth stage the three prooed 186 conducts acquired by the Sadhaka, should be strongthened. The fifth Acara 13 a stage of perfaat renunciation and it does not mean that Vama (woman) should be ut 111sed in the religious rite. The Sadhaka has nothing to do with a woman in his rite of 11beration, which is absolutely for bis owa purpose. The Vamaoara is the reverse or Dakaina and should not be misunderstood.

<p>The Sadhaka or this path should begin his Sadhana from the lowest and the grosgost aantre called muladhara and try to awaken tho Kundalini Sakti or oneey chiørly called Male Maya or Suddha Vidya in Tantras, waloh rena Ins 11 every human body in the state or dornanoy or sleep. The sixth Centre called Ajna Cakra is specially related to mind or Manas whion has been also said to be a land or Vikalpas, where all those Cakras ar. tranzoended. It is possible for a Badhaka to attain a pure and tranaparent light of knowledge free from all mental construotions or Vikalpas. The Tantras &lsquo;say that montal concepts or Vikalpas are originated from the action of the a lfferent varnas (letters) or Matrkas existing in the centres mentioned a bove. Thos. Matrkas account for all sort of montal sono opts which stand in the way of the realisation of the pure light. Accord ing to the Tantrike philosophy, human body is the storo-house of puro alvino energy in the torn of cit Sakti or Vieuddha Sabda Sakti umderstood as &quot; Kundalalini but as it is usually in dormant oona ition, it has to be roused in activity through a Yogic process. When it is awakened this power serving the mind and Prana or a Sadhaka begins to function in the sonoral form of purging of human body? In this process svory Cakra is alreatly arrested and is absolutely puririca.</p>
<p>In conneotion with the theory of Calras, it has to be noted that a Cakra 19 e yn bolised as a closed area of an activity ocnsisting of the three aspeots called outer most, intermediary and imost. The outermost espect la usually diploted as Dalaor Petal in a Cakra. The intermediary aspect is reprosented by a radiation within the Dala and the Centre. The Imost aspeot 19 symbol god by the Centre and the Vindu itself. The entiro Calra is a store-house or Vikalpas whioh generate forth Vikalpas</p>

<p>every moment. When the awakened Kundalini enters into the region of Matrkas oulled Varnay, they are all desolved and lose their identity in Mada from whioh thoy emanate. As a result of this process, Wada is also desolved Into Vindu or Para Nada ana this Vindu nargos into Unity. By this graded process we shall have the nanifestation of puro knowledge which reveals itself and is never dominated by: any outer influenoo. Thus the transcending of the six Cakras is a main souroe for tho attainment of divino know</p>

<li>Two methods for self-realisation, Noti Noti method and method of sublimation - Phenomenal appearances of the universe are not a irrerent from Siva ox Brahman mo the Vedantio school calls it, which is under a vol rar. the sake of its illusion, pley or Vaya. Similarly due dividual selves are Siva. They have lost and forgotten their idontity with Siva owing to ignorance which limits the reallsation of this identity. The lost laentity with Biva can be rearfirmed by the two meth or Maya Veda of Vedanta and the method or pubi ination,mentioned in Tantras. The first method moane elimination or negation. It negates the visible world as wreal or Asat. Thus by reduotion of the busk or sheath (Upadhi) into Zero, one can reaffirm the close, contact of the Atman or un Ivarse with the Braban or Siva. This method, accord. ing to which physical appearances are reduced to zoro oan not be ad&rsquo;o opted by the exponents of the Tantraa, who hold that all phenomana are glimpses or the suprahumaa Raality. They do not deny the multiform universo and therefore, they welcome the method of sublimation according to whion all : the visible objects of the world are said to bo dovieda through which one can approach the Invisible Tho mention or the various Dharanas (ental concentrationa) or tho a iver -gent tattvas described in the 18th to the 15th Adhikara of Ma 18 proof of the fact that the Tantrik &rsquo;nature of the book includes the method of sublimation, well-known in the Tantrik literature of India.</li>

Various methods, (v 18h1.) such as Panca dasa Vidhi, Panoa vidhi and Triviani mentioned in the second adhikara or the text, are proors of the method of sublimation.

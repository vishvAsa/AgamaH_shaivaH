<h2 id="preface">PREFACE.</h2>
<p>It is needless to say that contributions of :</p>
<p>Kashmir to Sanskrit literature are remarkable.</p>
<p>Apart'</p>
<p>from the other branches of literature, wonderful discover ies of the Kashmirian Soholars and saints in the sphere or the Advaita salva philosophy of India are no doubt, worth noting. The recent publications, bearing the title of Kashmir Series of texts and studies by the State Government throw light on the philosophical and spiritual lives of the scholars the country has produced. All their philosophic and religious teachings, known as Kashmir Saivism rather Trika Sasana of Kashmir give us the correct estimate of the spiritual fervour and the</p>
<p>literary zeal of the age. As a matter of fact the</p>
<p>trika dargana of Kashmir comprises its various aspects</p>
<p>in itselr and represents the unity of the three principles which are elaborately discussed in their proper place.. The present work, Malini Vejayottara Tantra, is chiefly</p>
<p>connected with the Trika School and Abhinava Gupta, a</p>
<p>great scholar and sage of the 10th century A.D., has regarded it as an authority on it.</p>
<p>From the beginning of my literary career, I&rsquo; was influenced by the Śaiva and Sakta oult of Kashmir</p>
<p>not because it belongs to my native place but because it presents the Śaiva mataphysics in its true perspective. I made up my mind to study this Philosophy and, therefore, consulted Shri J.C.Chatterj1, the late Superintendent of the Government Research Library, Srinagar. He suggested</p>
<p>to me the present work, Malini Vejayottara Tantra as</p>
<ol start="11">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>thesis for the degree of Ph.D.</p>
<p>The study of the Kashmir Śaiva School cannot be complete unless the teachings of Malini vijayottara Tantra are brought into light. The work is primarily associated with the Trika School and contains all its externals and fundamentals in it in brief.</p>
<p>I have divided the work into three parts: first contains the theoritical and practical teachings of Malini, the second deals with the summaries of the text. Chapterwise, English translation and elucidation of some dootrinal points and the third contains appendices and Index.</p>
<p>The work, 18 obviously difficult due to its occult teachings and obscure technical terms, used for</p>
<p>the formation of mantras.</p>
<p>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooo</p>
<p>I may mention that one of the difficulties that</p>
<p>stood in my way in connection with this thesis is the</p>
<p>paucity of authoritative work on the school in general and on Malini literature in particular,</p>
<p>How far I have succeeded in my present attempt :</p>
<p>of the elucidation of the Malini intricacies may be judged by the students in future.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to Pt. Laksmana Ju, a great scholar and saint of Kashmir, and Mahamahopadhyaya Pt. Gopi Nath Ji Kaviraj, M.A. or Banaras, a learned scholar of the Indian philosophies in general and an authority on the Kashmir Saivism in particular who helped me to comprehend the georets of the Śaiva oult. I am very thankful to Dr. Surya Kanta Ji.M.A., D.Litt., Head of th Sanskrit Department, Hindu University, Banaras, whoruided me in my thesis. Lastly I offer my hearty thanks to my colleague Professor P.N.Qazi, of the Government . College for Women, Srinagar, who helped me in my doctrinal and linguistio difficulties.</p>

<h2 id="part-i-introduction">Part I. (Introduction)</h2>
<p>I. Title Description and Historical background of the work.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>(a) The term, Malini&rsquo;, is used in a technical sense and chiefly means Sakti, an inherent nature or śiva. The name of the work is based on it. In the 1st. adhi. of Mā., the author has stated it as &lsquo;Maya&rsquo; and asori bed&rsquo; all the qualities of the Absolute to it. In the 3rd. adhi., 1t is said to be loonā, from which the phenomenal multi plicity emanates. The further developments of Iccha Sakti are jáana and Kriya Saktig. Th18 Sakti, in its transcendent atate, is one with Siya and has no its distinctive character. This supreme will or ŝakti or siva, in the state of mani festation, assumes various titlog. For example, in connec tion with the origin of letters, the Sakti is named as Malini or Matrka in the 3rd. adhi. of the work.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>The two terms, &lsquo;Matrka&rsquo; and &lsquo;Malini&rsquo;, are firstly applied as synonyms and represent the Vaikhari state in which words (sabda) and tñeir meanings (artha) emerge out separately in the form of Vacaka and Vacya. But later on, the two new terms, A bh innayoni Malini&rsquo; (whose Yoni or consonants are not impregnated by the vowels) and bh innayoni (whose Yoni is impregnated by vowels) are applied to Matrka And Malini, which have basically separated them. Now, by the Matrkā or Abhinnayoni Malini we mean that Sakti from which all letters spring up in the form of vowels and congo nants. Similarly the Malini or bhinayoni Malini signifies the order of apphabet in whioh the vowels and consonants are 00-mingled. The alphabetical order of the Malini school begins from &rsquo;na&rsquo; and ends in pha&rsquo; and hence sometimes it</p>
<p>LM</p>
<p>18 salled &ldquo;Nad 1 Phanta&rsquo; Malini. This co-mingling of the vowels and oonsonants in the alphabetical order implios the extreme type of monism (perema-advaita) which was a grevable to its exponents.</p>
<p>Both, Malini (bhinnayoni malini) and Matrka abhinnayoni malin1), regarded as two Śaktig, represent</p>
<p>Kashmir Salvism. . They strictly follow the fundamental</p>
<p>principles of the Trika School and represent themselves as</p>
<p>alphabetioal order. The Matrka Sohocl admits two classes of letters, vowels and consonants, technically called vija and yoni.. These two classes are again divided into nine groups in the following: -</p>
<ol>
<li>Avarga (sixteen vowels), 2. Kavarga, 3. Cavarga, 4. Tevarga, 5. Tavarga, 6. Pavarga, 7. Yavarga, 8. Savarga, 9. Kșa (Ma., III, 9-11).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Malini School has co-mingled vowels and &lsquo;conso nants and its alphabetical order is as under:</p>
<p>Na, I, r, Ir, lr, tha, oa, dha, 1, na, u, u, ba, ka, kha, ga, gha, na, 1, a, va, bha, ya, da, dha, tha, jha, ja, ra, te, pa, cha, la, a, sa, ah, ha, sa, kbe, ma, sa, am, ta, e, ai, o, ai, da, pha.</p>
<p>This ourious alphabetical order was in vogue in the 10th century A.D. when Abhinava Gupta, the founder of Matrkā school, rlour ished. He respected Malini vijayottara tantra in whioh the Malin i sakti (bhinnayon 1 Malini) is glorified. . As a matter of fact, his chief work , Fantra loke, is just like a commentary on the Malini School. The</p>
<p>school died out in his time. No later writer of Trika has written anything a bout it.</p>
<p>Abhinava Gupta mentions this Malini as a Primary form of Sakti. It brings all Siddhis when it is worshipped in its united form of vowels and consonants (or. Malini hi bhagavat í mukhyam saktam rupam vījayonigamghattena Samasta Kandughan, T.9.).</p>
<p>The literal meanings of the term &ldquo;Malini&rsquo; are - &ldquo;Mala asyaasti iti Malini. (that Sakti which contains all 1ts letters in the form or a garland). This sense is also stressed by the following text of T.A.</p>
<p>*Anvartham Caltann ama rudra Sakti malabhiryukta,</p>
<p>eto. T.A. page 135.</p>
<p>Utpala Dova mentions Malini Sakti as an essence of the phenomenal universe and regards it as a great power. and Goddess that sustains life of the animate and inanimate world (cr. Yat Saramasya Jagatah Sa Devi Malini Para. Maha Satta Mahadevi Vigyajivana Muoyate. I.Pr.7.1.5.14).</p>
<p>The author of Ma. has stated phones as chier, characteristio of Malini, by which words are formed (or. vãoo varnatmika yasmad varnarupā ni Malini, Ma. 21st, 8).</p>
<p>From the Tantrika point of view, all letters of Malini School are ta bulated in the form of a garland in the following:</p>
<p>One more feature that distinguishes them from each other is the origin of the different categories from their letters.</p>
<p>According to the Matrka School, the origin of the thirty-five principles 18 agoribed to the consonants and the vowels. The letters of the Matrka, from which different tattvas spring up, are tabulated below in an aso end ing order (aroha brana):</p>

<p>The origin of the thirty-five tattvas from the letters of the Malini school in the ascending order is dirferent from that of the above mentioned Matrka. The main cause of this differentiation is their different</p>
<p>alphabetioal orders. Acoording to the Malini, the origin of the principles from its letters is given below:</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the letter &rsquo;na&rsquo; is not</p>
<p>found here.</p>
<p>(b) The work represents itself as a class or the Agana Sastra, the authorship of which is attributed to Siva himself. It cannot be denied that it is understood as an e authority on the Trika form of Kashmir Saivism (or. Trika saram malinimatam, T.A., I.). The work, as its contents point out, mentions various types of the Śaiva Sadhana.&rsquo; The striking feature of the work, which distinguishes it from the other trika literature, 18 its equal emphasis on the dootrine (jnana) and practice (Kriya). Due to this special characteristio, we can emphatically declare that the work discloses its psycho-physical nature.</p>
<p>The fundamental objeotive of the work is Siva Yoga, Sivadvaita or Sankara Yoga (1dentity of the limited self with the supreme self). In the very beginning or the</p>
<p>Inspired by Sakti, come to Kartikeya, son &lsquo;or Sankara and Una, who is the killer of Taraka, the demon, with a view to learn Siva-Yoga. The system lays much stress on the initiation (diksa), without which the 3 iva-Yoga, the desti nation or human striving, cannot be achieved. The system has obviously stated that those, who, according to the salva tenets, are unified with siva, the Infinite, never become animals again (of. Na bhuyah pasutameti suddhe sva tmani tisthati, Ma. I, 47).</p>
<p>The chief theme of the work is removal of the paau-bhava (an inal state) and the attainment of the Siva hood. For the achievement of this end, the author of the work has followed the popular schools, the School of Know ledge (jnana-marga), expounded by the Upanis ads and the advaita Vedanta and the School of Yoga, founded by Patanjali, and represented them in a synthesized form. The Vedanta believes that the mental discipline is a means to self</p>
<p>realisation. By means of the higher centre, we can over come the lower one. &ldquo;The Yoga School of Patanjali stress es the physical d 1go ipline by which the higher centre can be subdued. The Malini sohool represents itself as a part of the Tantras and Salvagamas and therefore holds both the methods respectfully and equally. According to it, full balance between the body and the mind is needful. Either of them cannot sufrice for self-knowledge.</p>
<p>Malini Vijaya has divided the two methods, mentioned above, into three classes, viz., anavopaya, Saktopaya and Sambhavopaya. The first and the third olass correspond to the Yoga and the Jnana or the Patan jala and the Vedantia School respectively. As regards. the nature or Saktopaya, it is the combination or both, Yoga and Jnana. It is needless to say that the three</p>
<p>Yoga, the bhakti-yoga and the Jnana-Yoga.</p>
<p>In the whole work, the forta of the author is how one can rise froń the gross to the subtle. The detailed explanation of the Şadadhvan (81xfold path), various dharanas (concentrations) and the pancadasi, eto., oonfirm the fact (mā, III, XII-XIII and II). Besides, :</p>
<p>the author has thrown light on the very interesting topios of the Tantrika Sadhana.</p>
<p>var</p>
<p>The work, as we learn from the words or Uma (Ma. I, 8), 18 a part of sidahayogisvarī tantra (not avallable). From the text, it is also clear that the work oonsists of two parts, called Purva Malini and Uttara Malini. Unfortunately, the first part of the work is not available. The second part, Uttara Malini or malini Vijayottara tantra, is mainly a blend of Jnana (philosophy)</p>
<p>and Kriya (practice), which are the fundamental themes of the siddha and Namaka tantra, regarded as two sections of the 3 iddha Yogišvarí.</p>
<p>By the close study of the Śaiva literature or Kashmir, we conclude that the Malini School has not en Joyed a long life due to its rigorous methods of Sadhara. on account of the loss of its preliminary section, Purya Malini, we are not in a position to lay any remark on its significant points. It is Abhinava Gupta, a soholar and spiritualist or the 10th Century AD, that regards Malini as a principal treatise on the Trika, formulated by Vasu Gupta in his inspirational work, the Siva Sutras, and pays high esteem to it. It is also a fact that the tradition of the Malini gystem could not continue after Abhinava Gupta. No later writer of the Kashmir Saivism has supplemented the School of Malini.II. A brief survey of its contents and its place in the</p>
<p>Tantrika literature in general and the Trika literature in partioular.</p>
<p>(a) As regards the brief account of the funda mantals of the system, they are arranged in the twenty three chapters oalled &ldquo;adhikaraa&rdquo;. Some of the adhikaras point out the subjeot they explain. At the very outset, the author has divided his philosophical scheme into two groups, viz., acceptable (upadeya) and avoidable (heya).</p>
<p>The group of the six, 1.e. siva, Sakti, Mantra manośvara, Mantresvara, Mantra and anu (vijnanākala), belongs to the upadeya olags. Three impurities, called änava, kamna and maya mala, are mentioned as heya.</p>
<p>The authorities on the School have conceived Siva, the Supreme Reality, as Sakala (immanent) and niskala (trangaendent). The first epithet implies Sakti, the free will of the lord, while the second refers to oit or consciousness. Thus Siva or Parama Siva, regarded as the Absolute in the Saive system, is a united whole of Jnana and kriya. The doctrine of the anava mala la conneoted with these two characters.</p>
<p>process</p>
<p>The process of creation (Srstikrana) mentioned by the school is also curious. The pure world of the pure principles (Siva, sakti, Sadasiva, etc.) is created by Siva himself. The oreation or the impure universe is attributed to the eight lords, ananta, eto. or aghora, par ama ghora, ato. (Nã. I, 19, of. Suddhe dhvani Sivan karta prokto &rsquo;nanto sito pra bh uh, T.A.). .</p>
<p>Sakti or freedom of Siva holds an important place in the Salva thought. This principle is responsible</p>
<p>No Sadhaka is</p>
<p>for the manifestation of the universe. liberated less Sakti helps him. .</p>
<p>The system also lays down the fact that Siva, the infinite prino iple, is rinitised und ass unes various grades and stages of his unlimited being. The power, by which the womeasured is measured, the undirferentiated is.</p>
<p>dirferentiated and the inr inita 19 compressed in the finite, is fakti.</p>
<p>The present sygt en mentiono innumerable Saktis or siva, among which only three, apara, paraparā and para are primary.</p>
<p>The dootrine of competency and the significance or Guru cannot be negleoted in connection with the contents of the work. Like the Vedio Sadhena, the Tantrika way or Sadhana is not restricted and reduced to only a superior</p>
<p>class of nen. Any man of any caste and creed, whether male or female, is equally admitted to the spiritual realisation of the Tantrika type, provided he or she proves himself or herself competent for the job before the reli gious preceptor (Guru) according to the dootrine of compe tenoy (adhikaritva) mentioned in Mā. IV, 8.</p>
<p>According to the Malini system, in the scheme of spiritual realisation, Guru is highly stressed and he has a wonderful rolo to play. Though he is a human being, he should be regarded as an image of siva (Mā. II, 10, VI, 29). He ought to initiate his disciple and equip him with the necessary materials for the difficult spiritual journey. Carelessness in the orrioa of Guru surely leads aspirants to degradation and fall.</p>
<p>For the attaiment of the final goal, the</p>
<ol start="11">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>formules, mentioned in the Salva scriptures, are of very little use. They can not lead him towards the true path which can be shown by a Guru, A Sadhaka is advised to seek a preceptor of good type.</p>
<p>The theory of seven pramatęs, mentioned in Ma.II, ig reference to the various grades or stages of Sadhakas.</p>
<p>The mention of the panoadasa, trayodasa and</p>
<p>ekadasa vidhis throwa 11.ght on the wonderful method of the Sadhana and distinguishes the school from the Trika typo or Sa ivism. It also refers to the method of sublimation, well-known in the Tantrika literature of India.</p>
<p>Tho dootrino of the three upayas, referred to in the 2nd. adhi. of Ma, corresponds to the theory of the bhavas (nature), expounded by Sarvanenda in his work, . S.U.T.</p>
<p>The explanation of the five states, viz., jāgrat, svapna, susupta, tury, and turyatita, points out the five Śaktis of siva, due to which he is regarded as a doer of the five actions (panoay idhakrtyakarī).</p>
<p>Dootrine of sixfold path or şadadhvan is another chief content of the work. The path is arranged in two groups, vacakadhvan and vaohyadhvan. The constituent parts of the first division in an ascending order aro mantra, pada and varna. The latter consists of bhuvana, tatta and kala.</p>
<p>Arrangenent of the Şadadhvan in the four andas, called parthiva, prakrta, mayiya and &lsquo;sakta, is another peculiarity of the school.</p>

<p>In conn motion with purification (bhuta&ndash;suddhi), the mention of the threefold anganyasa, that is, a para, paraper and para vidhi, is a remarkable character of the work.

<p>Concentrations (aharanās) on the gross elements, panoatanmatras, mana, buddhi, ahankara and ten senses (indriyaa) expose the peculiarity of the Sadhana the school lays down. It also discloses the fact that macrocosm and niorocosm are equally important to a spiritual seeker (Ma. XII-XVI).</p>
<p>TF kinds of Sadhana, laksvabheda and cittabheda,</p>
<p>referred to in Ma.XII, are remarkable.</p>
<p>The work does not fail to mention the method of pranayana (breath-oontrol) with its other variations as a</p>
<p>e means to self-control. As a matter of fact, the system does not attach much importance to it.</p>

<p>By a brier review of the contents, we cannot hesitate to remark that the work contains philosophy and religion and its importance as a philosophio and religious work cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>(b) The tantras are an epitome or the different forms of Sadhana because they are influenced by the varied religious cults and the divergent branches or Indian philosophy. Like the Vedas, they also claim great antiquity. The students of Tantras can not miss the</p>
<p>monotheistio philosophy of the Upanisads and the absolute</p>
<ol start="15">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>monism or Sankara in them. Some of them are character igea by polytheism and pantheism of the Vedio period. In spite of all these various contents of them, they strongly stress 11beration as the summum bonum or human life. They have adopted different methods to meet this end.</p>
<p>The chief contents of them are description or the Şadadhvan, oono option of Matrka for the origin of letters, explanation of the thirty-six prino iples and their wonderful sidanis. In view of these characters, we do say that the nature of the Ma. system is Tantrika. ::</p>
<p>In spite of the features that reduce it to the Tantrika level, the system is, to some extent, a bit different from it. The essential character that differen tlates it from Tantras is its peouliar conoeption of the Absoluto, Both, the Mā. system of Kashmir Saivism and the Tantrika Sohool, regard Siva as absolute and transcendent.</p>
<p>The two terms, &lsquo;absolute&rsquo; and &rsquo;transcendent&rsquo; mean beyond relation&rsquo;. But the term, &lsquo;beyond&rsquo;, according to the Śaiva School of the Ma., means - &rsquo;exceed ing&rsquo; or &lsquo;wider than the relation&rsquo;. In the Tantrika School of Saivism, the same term, &lsquo;beyond&rsquo;, 18 explained in the sense - &lsquo;having no relation at alll. The Ma. School does not deny or exclude relation. In other words, it mentiong that the absolute is related to the world but has a wider sphere tban that of the relation. Aocording to this view, the absolute has relative universe in it. It is not denied. It exists in the absolute Reality but the latter is beyond it. The second view is acoepted by the Tantrika monism. It says that the absolute has no relation. The Vedanta also follows this view. The relative world 18 a play of Maya or a mere 11lā. To this view the world is umreal.</p>
<p>.</p>

<ol start="16">

</ol>
<p>For the further olar irigation of the term, absolute&rsquo;, diagrams (based on M.M.) are quoted in the following: -</p>
<p>TRI</p>
<ol start="17">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>I - &lsquo;A&rsquo;, the absolute, has excluded the B, a symbol of the relative world and, at the same time, is fuller than it. From the Chart, it is clear that the former (A) contains the latter (B) in it. The relative world is not excluded from it (the absolute). The Malini School of Kashmir Saivism holds this view. The system has pointed out this idea by two terms, &ldquo;Sakala&rsquo; and &lsquo;Niskala&rsquo; (mā. I, 18), meaning &lsquo;visvanaya&rsquo; (immanent) and &lsquo;visvo ttirna&rsquo; (transcendent). Both, immanency and transcendency or tho Reality, are agreeable to the Ma. School.</p>
<p>II - &lsquo;A&rsquo;, the absolute, is quite separate from the &lsquo;B&rsquo;, the relative world. The Tantrism and the Vedanta</p>
<p>explain the absolute in this senge. The supreme 1s irrelative and remains aloof from the relativity.</p>
<p>As regards the nature of the supreme, the view of the Trika 19 similar to that of the Melini. It also regards the Reality as visvamaya and visvottirna. The basis of this dual character of the supreme is its twofold aspeot. The School has conceived Siva, the Reality, as a united whole or two aspects dynamic and statio. The firat character implies sakti or vimarga-rupa sakti, an essential nature of siva. As regards the second aspect,</p>
<p>1t refers to its prakaga (universal 11ght) or oit tattva.</p>
<p>(oonsciousness). The Reality is immanent due to its</p>
<p>dynamio character. The basis of its transgendence is its statio feature. In a plainer language, we can say that the Absolute, according to the school, is balanoed state or&rsquo; . Kriya (dynami9m) and jnana (static) or vimarśa and prakasa.</p>
<p>To distinguish the Malini from the Tantrike School</p>
<p>in conneotion with the nature of the Supreme Reality, it is entirely essential to quote the words of Pr. Hr. in the following: -</p>
<ol start="19">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;Vigyottirnamatmatattvariti tantrilcah. Visvamayam&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. visvottirnan visvamayam ca iti trikad idarsanavidah&rdquo;. - Pr. Hr. Sv. 8, Comm,</p>
<p>Trom the statement, it is obvious that all of the three schools, viz. the Tantrika, the Kaula and the Trika, hold Siva as the Supreme Reality but as regards its essen tial nature, they differ from one another. The Reality, according to the Tantrikas, is transcendent. The Kaulas lay emphasis on its imanence. The Trika, on which the Malini is an authority, stresses the dual character of the Reality. It is both, immanent as well as transcendent.</p>
<p>As regards the nature of the Absolute, the view. of the Malini as well as the Trika School in comparison with that of the Tantrika and the advaita Vedantio system 1s illustrated by the two diagrams, cited above. They, as a matter of fact, are not sufficient to make out the correot position of the Ma. and the Trika Sohool in con nection with the supreme. I deem 1t fit to present the basic views of the schools by other diagrams, which, in fast, will enable the students of the Kaghmir Saivism to understand it in its true perspective. They will also disclose the stages of its manifestation. They with their partioulars are given as under:19.</p>
<p>· I. A B, the symbols of the absolute and tha rolutive universe or Sakti, are in an equalised state. It is a united whole of the dynamic and the statio aspects. The state points out the siva-sakti-Sanarasya or Samya avasthā (homogenious stato).</p>
<p>II. A - absolute contains the B, the relative universe or sakti in it. Hetrogeniety begins in this state but it is not explicit.</p>
<p>III. A - absolute and B-Sakti or the relativo world appear linked in their separate entities. The state 1s technically called &lsquo;yamala&rsquo; or twin.</p>
<p>IV. A, B and o refer to the absolute, the Sakti and the individual (the product of the A and B) rospective ly. The &rsquo;d&rsquo; in the table points out the phenomenal universe that proceeds from the O, the limited solr.</p>
<p>To estimate the position of the Ma School correot ly, the brief review of the Trika literature, divided into three parts, Agama, Spánda and Pratya bhijñā sastra, is</p>
<p>necessary.</p>
<p>The first and the foremost work, belonging to Agama olass, 18 siva sutras, which, as the Kashmirian tradition mentions, are revealed through Vagu Gupta. The work, as it seems from K.S. lays down the elementary prin oiples of the Trika system for the first time. The work represents itself as a type of idealistio moniam. The ultimate Prino 1ple, admitted by the School, 18 Siva, the Absolute, The system regards it, as immanent and trans oondent. The character of the work is theoretical..</p>
<p>The Spanda branch or saivism lays down the main</p>
<p>prino iples of the system in a more detailed form than the</p>
<ol start="20">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Siva Sutra, without, or hardly, ontering into philosophical</p>
<p>I susonings fu their support.</p>
<p>The principal work belonging to this class 13 Spanda Karika by Kallata. The theme of the work is based on the Siva Sutras. It seems as a commentary on them.</p>
<p>The author of it, no doubt, admits siva as the supreme,</p>
<p>but signiricance attached to the Spanda (vibration) Sakti cannot be denied. The theoretical feature of the work can not enable us to distinguish 1t from the Siva Sutras.</p>
<p>The Pratya bhijna (recognition) Sohool may be regarded as the Manana or vicara Sastra (philosophy) or the Trika. The School is founded by Siddha Somananda, most probably a pup 11 of Vasu Gupta.</p>
<p>The first work which has laid the foundation of the School is Siva drsti by Somananda who deals rationally with the doctrines, tries to support them by reasonings and</p>
<p>refutes the views of the opponents.</p>
<p>The second chier work of the School is Isvara pratyabhijna by Utpala dova. The treatise on the School deals with the fundamental prinoiplas of the Trika ex</p>
<p>haustively and, to some extent, has superseded the Siva. drati or Somanenda.</p>
<p>From the brief account of the principal works on the Trika philosophy, it is cleur that they strengthen the philosophical aspect of it. As regards the practical side</p>

<p>of it, they gey vory little.</p>

<p>that separete it from the other uvailablo wolks, such as, Svecchandatantra, vijnana Bhairava, Batanga, Mrgendra and Netra tantra of unknown authorship, are its dootrines of Punadašu and trayodusa vidhi, etc. (Mū.II). Similarly, the doctrine of the threorold anganyasa is also a pecu liarity of the system. The apara anganyesa is presoribed for the Sadhakus of the dvaita class. According to it, the body of a Sadhaka, from feet to forehead, is supposed to be 84 fingers. In this measurement, all the tattvas are to be realised. The parapara vidhi is meant for the dual plus non-dual olags of Sadhakas. The body, from feet to brahmarandhra, is considered to be 96 fingers. All the principles are realised in this space. The para method</p>
<p>of the anganyaga 19 specified for the Sadhakas of the</p>
<p>advaita class. The body of a Sadhaka, from feet to brahma randhra, is supposed to be 98 fingers. Twelve fingers are to be added to this measurement. In the space of 108 ringers, Sadhakas are directed to realise all the categories</p>

<p>III. Outline of the Trika Culture (Philosophy and religion)</p>
<ul>
<li>with a brief review or its history.</li>
</ul>
<p>(a) &ndash; 1. The triple thought, specially known as Trika Sasana or Sastra, is a chief branch of Kashmir Saiviam and upholds, as its name indicates, three oategories, viz., (1) Siva, all-doing and all-knowins, (2) Sakti, personal nature of the ultimate Prino iple and (3) anu, the individual</p>
<p>selr under the bondage of three impurities or 1 imitations.</p>
<p>The three principles, mentioned above, represent basic unity, due to which, the school is called non-dual (advaita). As a matter of fact, the one fundamental unity, by means of its freedom or Svantantrya Sakti, mani rests itself in the three forms in the state or creation. The Supreme Reality, in its solr-division, does not lose its essential nature and remains the absolute one.</p>
<p>From the psychological point of view, the three prinoiples of the triune thought, Siva, Sakti and nara; correspond to consciousness, sub-conscious and unconscious - negs respectively and refer to the three phases of Indian. philosophy, viz., unity (abheda) unity in diversity (bheda - bheda) and diversity (bheda).</p>
<p>From the 3 akta point of view, the trichotomy or</p>
<p>the system is understood as combination of three Saktis, para, paraparā and aparā or lochā, jneng and kriya, which algo indicate abheda bhed a bheda and bheda.</p>
<p>From another (tantrika) point of view, the Sohool represents three short vowels, a, 1 and u and 18 technioally oalled Sadardhakramasastre (T.3.IX) or Şadard hakr ana vijnana (T.A.I). As a matter of fact, the six vowels, a, a, i, i, u, u, are recognised as forma</p>
<ol start="33">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>of Anuthara (šiva or oit-sakti) Ānanda (ananda sakt 1) Iccha, Igena, Unmesa and Urmi respectively in the tantrika school. The three vowelg, a, i, u, are taken out of the six, already mentioned. The name of the school is based on them and they are regarded as forms of oit (Anuttara), Iocha and Unmesa (Jnana Sakti). The long vowels a, i, u are représentatives of ananda Sakti, isana (condensed form of locha) and Urmi (condensed form of jnana).</p>
<p>In connection with the meanings of the term, Trika&rsquo;, the Tantrika view, which stresses the three short vowels as a true form of the Trika, seems most agreeable to the Ma. of all those, already mentioned. From the text or the Ma., it is obvious that it has arranged the six vowels, mentioned above, in three groups, called Satka, Trika and ake, which represent a ā 1 uü, ai u and a respectively (cf. Tatra S ampujayet gatkam trika vapyekareva va, Ma. VIII, 109).</p>
<p>There is one point to be noted in this connection. The three short vowels are associated with the oit, Iocha and jnane, recognised as the principles of the purs universe. The Kriya Sakti is intentionally eliminated from this aroup as it is related to the waya, a tattva or the impure world. The relation of the three vowels to the sacred universe implies their purity that Tantrikas and the Ma. School have kept in view. Besides, their place in the Tantrika Sadhana is no less important.</p>
<p>A brief account of the three principleg is as</p>
<p>under.</p>
<p>I. Siva.</p>
<p>The supreme Reality, Siva, is conceived as a</p>
<p>United whole of the two attributes, consciousness (jnana)</p>
<ol start="24">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>and Kriya (freedom). The characteristics are regarded as tyre espects of one Reality. The first aspect, called Toit&rsquo; (oonsciousness), represents itselr as (Prakasă! (111umination). The second aspect, regarded as &lsquo;freedon or &lsquo;Kriya&rsquo; represents vinarsa&rsquo; or the illumined. The idea of the two aspects or siva is referred to by Ma. I,</p>
<p>in other way.</p>
<p>The perfect balance or the Static end dynamic aspects of sive 18 experienosd by &lsquo;I&rsquo; which represents Perananta (full egoity). The I-ness of this state is symbol of perfect unity and is free from all differentiat ions. The sense of this-ness (Idam) is fully merged in the I-ness. It is the State of supreme consciousness (Para Samy it) in which subconsciousness and unconsoiousness are also latent in their unmanifested forms.</p>
<p>II. Sakti.</p>
<p>In the State of Menifestation, the equ1libriu or bodha (consciousness) and Kriya (freedom) is lost. The vimarśa aspect renresenting free will of the supreme Reality 19 disegsociated from the balanced state of Jnana and Kriya. Sakti Tattve, 98 a matter of faot, is not an independent unit. It is the freedom of Siva, manifested in the form or Sakti. Due to this separation of freedom, developed as</p>
<p>gakti&rsquo;, limitation begins in the essential nature of Siva, who was regarded as free agent, all-door, (omniscient and Omnipotent). In the Sakti State, the aense of diversity begins to emerge. mhe definite nature of this dirferen tietion 13 yet not known. Sakti, no doubt, 19 a seed of limitation, which hsg not been externalised. The State is also experienced by the &lsquo;I&rsquo;. The I-ness of the Sakti</p>
<p>State is different from that of the Siva State.</p>
<p>The .I!</p>
<ol start="25">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>or the latter is emlar than thet of the former. The &lsquo;I&rsquo; or the Šekt 1 ig bent tovards this-ness (Idanta). At any rate, we cannot establish salti, as a geperate entity, apart from siva, It is his instrument by which he delimits Fimself.</p>
<p>. From psychological point of view, Sakti is sub conso lous state of the perfectly conscious Siva. It falls between two roles, 1.6. consciousness and unconsciousness. Sakti is neither perfectly congcious nor totally uncona cious. It is means that transforms the absolutely oonscious into the totally unconscious. It helps the Infinite to make Itself finite.</p>
<p>III. Nara (Limited Self).</p>
<p>Nero, technically called &ldquo;anu&rdquo;, represents limited form of sive, who has abscurated His essential nature by His own free w111. It is a bound state (Buddha-avastha) of the Roality, created by Its sakti. The equilibrium or bodha and Kriya, which represents Siva state is totally lost in the Anu State. The Kriya aspect appears as Sakti, which again divides the bodha aspect and manifests it ag Anu. As a matter of fact, Nara and Siva are not distinct from each other (of. Jīvaḥ,Sivah Sivo Jivah Sa Jivah Kevalah Sivah. kui ?. Cha. IX-42).</p>
<p>Thus the one whole (Purna), appearing itself in the three forms, does not lose its essential characteristio. The one remaing one. Siva 18 like universal artist. His Sakti is just like a brush. The anu is a picture which the Artist draws by His brush, the Sakti. The instrument and the product corresponding to sakti and Nara aro not. dirrerent from siva, the Universal artist. The pioture, drawn by His free will, is the universe of phenomena.</p>
<ol start="28">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The three principles, nar&rsquo;a, sakti and siva are teonnically termed as &lsquo;Sthula&rsquo; (gross), Sukşma (Subtle) and Para (Beyond subtle), respectively. The trichotomy of the system is applicable to all the tattvas (elements ) and fundamentals, conneoted with the Śaiva School (of.. Sthulam suksmem param viduh (T.A.).</p>

<li>Before we explain Spanda and Pratya bhijna in relation to the Trika, it is proper to say a word or two a bout the siddhanta and the Pasupate Schools or sa ivism, which, in spite of their agreement with the Trika in their externals, basically differ from it in fundamentals.</li>
</ol>
<p>· Siddhanta Selva School is a duelist in the sense that it believes in the existenoe of the three basio prin ciples, viz., Siva, Sakti and Vindu. Siva is said to be pure and absolute conscious. It is imrautable in character and is regarded as Cidrupa. As regards the sakti principle, it is also conceived to be cidrupa but it is not statio like siva. Phenomenal expansions and contractions or movements are assigned to its dynamic nature. Both, siva and Sakti are immaterial. Vindu, in its pure and impure form, is matter aria is the material basis of the created</p>
<p>universe.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Man, as such, is of the nature of siva though this nature may remain clouded or obscured until it is finally restored to its divino status.</p>
<p>According to the Pasupata School, Pati (Lord), Pasu (animal) and Paga (bonds or fetters) are the three ultimate principles. Pati or more correctly Pasupati (Siva) is divine. Pagu is also conceived divine by nature and is under the bondage of matter called Paga. When this bond 19 snapped it regains its diyine character but not the status of Mehesvaratva or Lordship.</p>
<p>The chief characteristic of the school is its conception or Mukti (11beration). It admits a lower form of mukti, called Kaivalya (freedom). This is callad. duhkhenta or Kairalya mukti when the pasu is freed from the chaing of the world and from all the miser les incidental</p>
<ol start="30">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>to the worldly life. The pasu-nature still continues. Suoh a pasu is called niranjana, as opposed to sanjana, but it is not divine.</p>
<p>In the Trika system, siva and Nara (individual</p>
<p>self) are one. When siva is under limitations, it becomes pasu or animal. When fetters are removed, it is again Śiva (or. Pasabaddho bhavej fivah pasamuktah sadasivah, vi. Bhai). It is the fakti of siva, oalled roddhri, that veils his essential nature and he appears as a pasu. when he rsa ing his essential character through his own Sakti, called vikas ini in this case, he becomes Siva. Thus, sakti in this school is most important tattva. Both, pasu-bhava and Siva-bhava are dependent upon it. The School is styled as an idealistic monist. The one appears in three forms oraated by its own freedom. In spite of the triple form, the one is still one.</p>

<li>The Term, &lsquo;Spanda&rsquo; (Lit., Inown as movement),</li>
</ol>
<p>O</p>
<p>Ocurg O</p>
<p>Eng</p>
<p>represents itself as an aspect of the Trika and exposes the secrets which are latent in the Sakti or śiva. The word &ldquo;Spanda&rdquo; occurs once in Ma. 18th, 5 in the sense of a vibration situated in the human heart. A Sadhaka 1g . directed to meditata on this movement, which according to Ma. seems to mean The Supreme Prino iple.</p>
<p>Abhinava Gupta has also explained the term (Spanda) in the sense of Parama Siva or Suprene conscious negg, which manifests Itself in the three forms, called Siva, Sakti ond Nara, correspond ing to the avyakta (non dual) vyaktavyakta (dual plus non-dual) and vyakta or dual (ot. Ekasya Spandanasya iga tridha bheda vyavasthitih. T.A. 5th.). Similarly the Spandana is also used in the sense of Anuttara #meaning the Supreme Self or Siva&rdquo;.</p>
<ol start="31">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The Euthor of 9.1.9. in the 1st. Ka., has used</p>
<p>the Spanda in the sense or flutter or movement. According to this text, Siva Tattya is the first flutter of Parema siva.</p>
<p>It enables us to say that the Spanda is freedom (svatantrya Sakti), regarded as an aspect of Parama siva. The advocates of this free will have raised it to a high status and explained the same as a separate, Spanda sakti by writing treatises on it. As a matter of fact, its value 18 as an aspect in the Trika and not a separate school.</p>
<p>Like the Spanda the Pratyabhijna (recognition) 19 not a separate school and is connected with the aspect #consciousness&rsquo; of Perama Siva. The supreme self and the individual self are identical in the state or liberation. This identity is forgotten in the creative State due to ita own freed om. The recognition of the lost identity is&rsquo; oall ed Pratyabhiina.</p>
<p>The foundership of the Spanda is attributed to Kellata, a pupil of Vasu Gupta. The principal work oon taining the tenets of the aspect is spanda Karikago by Kallata. It is a controversial point that Spanda Karikas</p>
<p>are not an independent work. They represent the theme of the Siva Sutras which are said to have been revealed to Vasu Gupta by Sivá. As tradition mentions, they were inscribed on a rock on the Mahadeva hill, four miles far from the Nishada carden in Srinagar in Kashmir. He taught them to his pupil, Kallata, who composed the Spanda Karika on them for the instruotion of his own pupils.</p>
<p>The followers of the Spanda system hold that Siva</p>
<p>as a supreme Reality is neither an erficient nor a material</p>
<p>gaus e.</p>
<p>According to them, God is independent and he</p>
<ol start="32">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>greates the world merely by the force of his will. This Torce or Şakti, regarded as responsible for the projection, maintenance and the destruation of the universe, is called Spanda. This sakti is a nain raotor that bringe an imal state as well as liberated state to $iva. A sadhaka realising this spanda tattva can know his real natura (S.N.N1. Com. Ist Ka Ibid. III N1.Ka 16).</p>
<p>The authorship of the Pratya bh1jna (recognition) is ascribed to Somanande, whose main work is &lsquo;Siva Drst1&rsquo;. The other principal treatise on it is Isvara Pratya bhijna by Utpaladeva, the commentator or which is Abhinava Gupta. The votaries of the aspoot hold that Siva is the fundamental Reality, which appsars as a phenomenel universe. They lay eruphasis on the Abhasa (Evolution) Vada, according to which, the world of multiplicity is evolved b ra, which was ideal -ly existent in the Reality.</p>
<p>The main topic of the Fratya Bhijna aspect 19</p>
<p>en identity of the individual sell and the material worla vith SiV9. Like the Trika thought, which mentiong the</p>
<p>unity of the three Tattvas, the aspect also admits the unity of the limited self, the sakti and the universal self. The doctrine of the crention of the World and the relation</p>
<p>betreen the individual soul and the supreme soul are the</p>
<p>same in this aspect as they are held by the Trika School. All diversity proceeds from unity and to reach the latter one should begin from diversity. To approach this unity is the primary the system deals with. But its approach is dirferent. The limited self and the supreme soul are</p>
<p>indentical.</p>
<p>The nature of the former is not separate from</p>
<p>that of the latter. The former has totally forgotten his essential nature, owing to the three taints, 1.8., anava, Karma and Maya Mala. The system mentions that the lost</p>
<p>N)</p>
<p>identity is recognised.</p>
<p>The Anu, when it recognises its</p>
<p>identity with Siva, is no more animel.</p>
<p>It becomes Siva.</p>
<p>The Sohool, like the Vedanta, does not mention that the phenomenal universe is an illusion. According to 1t, the material world is a reality. The mundane world is, in reality, Lpsychical life of the all-soul (Śiva), projected outwardly. The uppeurenco (Srsti) and dissolution (Pralaya)</p>
<p>are said to be urmesa (opening) and &lsquo;Nimesa&rsquo; (closing or $1va). Be awakens, the world, potentially latent within Fim, comes into being, when He 13 in the waking State, the world of phenomene exists. When he goes to sleep the world</p>
<p>withdrewn into Him and disappears. He is asleep and the world rests with Him As a potential magnitude till the now day of waking comes. Thus the world is not dirferent from the objectified or materialised conseiousness or Siva. siva, according to the philosophy, is simultaneously both cause and effect. He is quiescent and is always in perfoot repose. It is the doctrine of the Svantantrya or sovereign ty of God&rsquo;s will that imparts an impetus to the wordly process. . Thus the sakti of siva is algo prim un datum in this school.</p>
<p>The principle of the Prayabhijna school, in short,</p>
<p>1s that the individual golf in man is 3 iva. This identity of the limited self with the universal self is forgotten owing to the nascience and delusion. When this innowa</p>
<p>identity is brought or recognised, it is Pratyabhijna (I.P.A.). For example a King knows a man. Owing to some reasons, he forgets him. The minister of the king,</p>
<p>presenting the man before him, says - This is the man whom you already know&rsquo;. The knowledge or the man to the king is recognition. When the three taints of the limited.self disappear, it becomes aware of its siva state like the</p>
<p>prince who was taken away by a cowherd und was brought up in his association. He forgot his roal mature but when he</p>
<p>recognised his princely state, he was no more a cowhera.</p>
<p>According to the Vedanta philosophy, the whole universe is Brahman. The appearance of the phenomenal universe is Maya, or an 11lusion. The individualselt (livatman) does not realise itselr that it is Brahman. It is deluded by Maya. Sometimes a man mistakes a ropo for a snake owing to darknes&rsquo;s. Similarly the world ig Bratman but due to Maya it is not perceived correctly in its true perspective. The rope cannot be a snake. It is darkness that presents the reality in other form. When this misleadice element 18 ronioved, the reality appears as it is. The Vedanta reaches the Reality by negation. It denies the world, which, according to it, is a false show. Frou the Śaiva point of view, the world is reality. It cannot be denied. The universe is siva. The limitedselr 1s algo Śiva. It has forrotten its true nature that He is 3iva. To misunderstand a rope as a snake is not due to the darkness. According to the Salva Philosophy, it is forget fulness that works out and presents the rope in the form or a snake. When the reality is recognised, there is snake. It is the rope, which, for the time being, was forgotten and was misunderstood as a snake.</p>
<p>To sum up the fundamentals and dogmatics of the three, Trika, Spanda and Pratyabbijna, it would not be out of place to mention here that the Trika Philosophy is a blend of the three ways of God-realisation. The Spanda mentions the energy of the Lord Siva ag all in all. For</p>
<p>the realisation of this energy, an aspirant is ordered to</p>
<p>oontinue his meditation on the object till the vision or that supreme Bhairara comes. It is a Dhyana Yoga&rdquo;. By</p>
<ol start="35">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>this method all the impurities are oloered away and the en</p>
<p>med itator attains to eternal Bliss in the end.</p>
<p>The Pratyabhijña method is different. It does not mention any control of breath (Franayama eto.) for the attainment of the supreme vision of Sive. It maintains that the r6penition of oneself a9 3its is the way to obtain 11 beration. This method is philosophical and J.C. Chatterjee aalls it a &ldquo;Manang&rdquo; or &ldquo;yichera&rdquo; Šāstra (K.$.).</p>
<p>The Trika does not emphasise any one method. It equally mentions Kriya-yoga (anavopeya) inolud ing dyana yoga, saktopaye (Kriya frena) and Samonavopaya jnana). The system represents itself as a compendium of the various</p>
<p>methods for spiritual Sadhana.</p>
<p>4.From the Vedic age, it appears that Sabd ad or Mantras were regarded as a chief means to self-realisation. The spiritual efforts of the Vedic seers for God-realisation were absolutely based on them. They, therefore, from the earliest times, we find, have a close correspondence between the two aspects of Brahman, 1.0. Sabda brahman and Para brahman. Sabda brahman, represented by a Vedio Mantra, wag considered to be realisation of Para brahman. This method of Yoga, later on, came to be known as &ldquo;Vagyoga (Lit. unification of speech, techa, realisation of God. through speech or Sabda). We find it stated in the traditional literature of Vafyakaranes (Cremmar leng) or whom Bhartr Hari was best representative. He has clarified the position of Sabda and restored it to the divine status (or. Anad inidhanam brahma gabda tattvam pracakșate. Vivar titi &lsquo;rthabhävena prakriyā jago yatah, Va. p.). Parallel to the Vedic line, we come to know the same truth in the Tantrika line of oulture. Here we find a very close analysis of the structure of Sabda and the science or the</p>
<p>e</p>
<ol start="36">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Ame</p>
<p>Matrka that came to be developed in the Tentrika School in course of time. So called letters of the alphabet are und erstood, in reality, es ultimate units of vocal speech. Great Yogins applied their enervy to an investigation or all these principles, which constituts Mantras, and formu lated their views in their own ways. From the study of</p>
<p>history, we find that there were at least two methods or</p>
<p>arrangement of letters in the alphabet current in tho . anoient times. One method follows the genetic order or letters. According to this method, from the five princip centres of the articulato speech, from larynx to the lips, there arose five successive orders of both, vowels and consonants (cf. Akniha viser janiyanam kathah, etc.). This is the normal order, specially based on the I U laryngeal system, in vogue today. But there appears to have been another gecret order, in which, the alphabet begins with &rsquo;naand ends with pha&rsquo;. This peculiar arrangement is favoured by so called Ma. School, such as, distinguished from the other Matrka School. It seems that it is a very great spiritual significance.</p>
<p>The Ved 10 method of Sadhana, as we see, is in timately related to the Mantras, formed by tha units of syllables. This line of Sadhana is still continuing in the Tantrika Cult. Besides, the great spiritualists or the Tantrika period have found out the other method of Sadhana, called Varnayoga, as distinguished from the Mantra yoga. They have proved the fact by their personal exper. ience. Meditation or concentration on a certain phone yields the fruit, similar to that of the Mantra-Yoga. The recitation of an individual letter (Varna) is no less important than that of the Mantras. The ultimate goal,</p>
<p>according to both, Varna-yoga and Mantra-yoga, is equal.</p>
<p>The Tantrika approach to the unity through the .Varnas is</p>
<ol start="37">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>shorter than that of the Vedio School through the Mantres</p>
<p>but both are logically and psychologically based on sound prino iples. The former, in comparison with the latter, is simple and does not require the rich materials the latter needs. Moreover, the &lsquo;Tantrika way of self-reali sation through this method has no restriction. Any man or any class is admitted to the Sadhana of this culturo.</p>
<p>In this respect, the reis of the Tantrika oult are more broad-minded and generous than those belonging to the Vedio School. The Vedio Sadhana, in short, is meant for</p>
<p>men of a special class.</p>
<p>Mantras, as we learn from the Vedas are arranged in groups. The seers have assigned them to particular deities. Likewise, the scholars of the Tantrika system</p>
<p>have arranged the letters of the alphabet into two groups,</p>
<p>vowels and consonants, technically called &ldquo;Vija&rdquo; and</p>
<p>Yonin which represent one doity, Siva, in his two aspects, viz., sive und Sakti. This monistic trend,&rdquo; as opposed to that of polytheism, found in the early history of the Vedas, is a peoullarity of the Tantrika School.</p>
<p>Ascreption of the two-fold letter to Siva and Sakti has affected the saiva and the sakta cult, which, in this respect, are mutually related to each other. The Siva principle is oldrupa and static. The sakti is regarded as dynamio and is said to be part and parcel or siva. The equalised state or the statio and the dynamic</p>
<p>aspect makes Parama Siva, understood as tattvatita or</p>
<p>beyond name and form. From the point of view of the Varna Yoga, both, vowels and consonants, are representations or the &lsquo;Siva and Sakti prino ipleg. Varna-Yoga and Vyanjana Yoga, 18, in fact, a symbol of Śaiva Yoga in its two ag peats, siva and Sakti. Šaive Yoga, itself with its</p>
<ol start="38">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>.</p>
<p>symbolio form, is the inain theme of the Śaiva and Salcta</p>
<p>Tantras in general.</p>
<p>From the historical point of view, the progrerg ive development or the Šalva and the sakta cult is briealy mentioned. As regards the development of Kashmir Saivom It seems a fact that it has added one more principle, called &ldquo;jiva&rdquo; or &ldquo;anu&rdquo; to the twin (siva and sakti), already developed in the Tantrika culture of India and named it as &ldquo;Trikam. The third principle, &ldquo;anu&rsquo;, is understood as a joint product of Siva and Sakti, regarded as father and mother, in the form of a son. The three principles of the system, as a matter of fact, represent basic unity and refer to the doctrine of oneness (cf. Ekoham vahuh syam) of the Vedio oulture. The system speoially points the doctrine of evolution and explains it how one becomes many (or. Ekam vagtu dvidhā bhutam eto. P.T.). The first work, containing the elementary princi ples of the system is siva Sutra, revealed to Vasu Gupta, a Kashn Irian saga, through stva a Siddha. The time of Vagu Gupta&rsquo;s flourish, stated by R.G.Bhandarakara and Dr. Sudhendu Kunar Das in their works, HV.S.M.R.&rdquo; and 3 rospectively, is the oth contury A.D. The non-dual natur of the systen, mentioned in the work, reduces the phono menal universe to the fundamental unity which is character. 1ged as &ldquo;Caitanyamatma&rdquo;, s. 3ec., ist. Sec. The occasion references to the letters, representing Siva and Sakti are</p>
<p>also founâ in the work.</p>
<p>Its value as a representation of</p>
<p>the Trika tenets in brief, 18, no doubt, remarkable.</p>
<p>Kallata and Somananda, two pupils or Vasu Gupte, oont inued the tradition of the Trika system by their two respeo tive works, Spandakarika and Siva drsti. The linet</p>
<p>work, as we have already mentioned, is reproduction of the39.</p>
<p>game theme we find in the Siva Sutras.</p>
<p>The second work,</p>
<p>as its name signifies, deals with the Śaiva philosophy.</p>
<p>Throughout the work, the author stresses the idealistic</p>
<p>monism of the school. The author favoirs the thoory or evolution (abhagavada) and explains hov: moultiplicity begins from unity (cf. Yogivu nirupai anamartha jatam prokasayat s. dr.). The work, airsotly or ind ireotly, is related to the Trika School and lays down the foundation of the Pratya bhijñā.</p>
<p>The contributions of Utpaludeva, the disciple of Somananda, to the triple thought are very great. He</p>
<p>adopted the game three principles and explained them on the besis of pratyabhijna (recognition). He lays much emphasis on the forgetfulnose or siva that puts him under 1 imitations. The recognition of this state is, according to him, liberation which can be achieved by means or jñana (philosophy).</p>
<p>Another chief contributions to the syster are the works of Abhinava Gupta. Tantraloka in 32 chapters, called ahnika, entirely deals with Saivism of Kashmir. The work itself is a commentary on 2!al ini. The author of T.A., though eocepts the views of his predece 380rs but his pre</p>
<p>ference is to that of via. which he calls &lsquo;Briplerva Sastra&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He seems to explain the fundamentals of the latrka School</p>
<p>but in support of his views, he orten quotes Malini.</p>
<p>The method of the Varna-Yoga, as we have seen it, is ohiefly related to tho latters of two types, vovels and oongonants. The order of the alphabet, in which vowels</p>
<p>and consonants are comingled, is also associated with the Varna-Yoga and has its own significance. This order is favoured by the Ma. Sohool and it refers to the perfect unity. The system does not accept the two-Told division</p>
<p>of letters and their assignment to give and Sakti.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>Matrka system reaohes the baslo unity through duality. But the system Approaches the unity through unity. As Siva and Sakti are basioally one, similarly their ropre</p>
<p>sentatives, vowels and consonants are also one.</p>
<p>The exponents of the Malin i system have gone to the extreme. They are not prepared to accept difference between vowels and consonants, representing Siva and Sakti, and therefore they have commingled them in support or their</p>
<p>view.</p>
<p>This is a new approach to the Supreme Unity. For the first time, we have seen it in the system. All letters are equal and refer to the Malini Sakti behind when the transcendent siva exists.</p>
<p>Apart from this distinctive feature of the Na.</p>
<p>School, the other characteristio of the system is its prac tical Yome. The Malini cultura has understood theory and praotice or philosophy and religion as two aspeots of one thing. Theory without inner experience can not live long. Religion without the theoretioel support is lamo. In the system, both, jnana und practice, go side by side.</p>
<p>In the process of spiritualisation, according to</p>
<p>the Tantrika Sadhana, there are three states, viz., puri</p>
<p>ricatory, illuminant and unifying, rslated to tho three bodies of an agpirant, vayic, Sakta and vaindava. &ldquo;The first state implieg the bhuta suddhi which results in the removal of the Mayio body. The second state points out the nanodaya (the state of 11lumination or sthiti). 15 is not possible unless the sakte body is formed. The tert stresses the utility or the bhinna yoni Malini for</p>
<p>the formation of this deha (Ma. III, 36 ) which is trans</p>
<p>-rorine</p>
<p>into the Vrindava body.</p>
<p>As regards the literature of the Ma. system, we have got only three works, Maliniy ijayottara tantra, Tantraloka and Malinivijaya vartika by Abhinava Gupta. T.A. mainly deals with the Matrka School but occasional references to the Malini are not missing. The third &lsquo;work 1s e commentary on Malini, Vi. and seems incompleto. It has dealt with a few fundamentals of the system in a very dirrioult language. The only source that enables us to expose the nature of the system 13 the text of the Malini Vi.</p>
<p>To say anything on the correct position of the School is very difficult. The system is intimately re</p>
<p>lated to Purva Malini (preliminary section of the work),</p>
<p>Siddhayogisvari, siddha and Namaka tantra, which are not available at present.</p>
<p>(b)</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>1It is the spontaneous and innate tendency or</p>
<p>human mind that it attempts to find out the solution or the mystery of the universe after the task of meeting tho</p>
<p>immediate necessities of life. We must regard this inward maroh of human mind as the origin or philosophy. Tho human understanding, in its solitude, wants to find an explanation of the phenomenal multiplicity and variety. It desires to</p>
<p>know whether this visible plurality can be traced to the</p>
<p>original unity and whether this seeming variety is unreal.</p>
<p>It tries to ponder over the cause of the present disordu</p>
<p>and disconnectedness behind which the porrect harmony exists. This search or human reason for some common ground or fundamental unity, whero all diversities return and where all wbys are stopped, is a true aim of philosophy. The nature of this common ground, as Sastras describo, 18</p>
<p>eternal and whence tall 18 never possible (cr. Yad gatva na nivartante tadhana par aman mama. Bha. 61.) Whon a man reaches the Absolute Unity, he feels that all his faculties have attained their richest fruition. In this perfect state, nothing remains unknown to him. By the knowledge of the Infinitude everything becomes known to him (cr. Yasmin vijnate Sarvamidam vijñatam bhavati, cha. U. Chap. VI). It is a state of the perfect Homogeniety where no hetrogeniety remains. The Bhagvat Gita has explained this</p>
<p>state as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yam Labd hva caparam labham manyate nadhikan tatah, VI, 22 (Attaining which nothing in this universe seems to be better).</p>
<p>It is the funotion or philosophy that it dis oloses the inner vision of a man and brings the direct!</p>
<p>experience of the Absolute which pervades his whole system with the unspeakable joy. It is the intuitivo experience</p>
<p>of the Absolute that we are enabled to have a correct estimate of philosophy. All human reasonings should continue until&rsquo;the final goal, the perfect synthesis is reached. The real value of philosophy lies in the attain inent of the absolutely homogenious Reality.</p>
<p>There is a considerable difference between the conception of philosophy as it is understood by the Indian systems of philosophy on the one hand and as it is taken to be by the Western Philosophers on the other. Although we noto important points of similarity between the philosophi oal discussions of the Westera thinkers and the Indian systems of philosophy st111 we cannot ignore the fundamental digt inotion between them. Philosophy, in the West, 12 tha words of Dr. Nalini Kanta Brahma in his work P.H.S., is the</p>
<p>Thinking consideration of things. It is the rational</p>
<p>explanation of the universe as a whole. Thus, in the West, Philosophy is somathing purely intellectual. It is lilo the other subjects of study and bears no special importance. The transcendent mer it and the indepenient character of philosophy which the six schools of the Indian philosophical systems emphasise are not recognised in the Weat. In the East, Philosophy is taken as summum bonum of life. It is understood as be-all and end-all or life in India. It 19 hardly anything more than an intelleotual pastime in the West. In this connection the words of 3 ir Radha Krishnan are remarkable - &ldquo;In many other countries of the world, reflection on the nature of existence 19 a luxury of life. The serious moments are given to action, while the pursuit or philosophy comes up as parenthesis. In the West, even</p>
<p>in the hey-day of its youth as in the tinies of Plato and Aristotle, it leaned for support on some other study as</p>
<p>Politics or Ethics - - In India, philosophy stood on its</p>
<p>own legs, and all other studies looked to it for inspiration and support. I.P. Vol.I.</p>
<p>The Indian mind has regarded philosophy as ons of</p>
<p>TOOI</p>
<p>the chief egt means that solve the richest problem of sal vation considered as the ultimate good of human liro. It relieves men of the miseries of life and bestows on hin the indescribabla bliss. A man, seeking emancipation from the fearful bondage, occupies himself with the study of philoso phy. The intellectual discussions available in the Indian Philosophy are not merely intended to supply the needs or intellect. They are meant to serve the ultimate and funda mental need of human life, viz., The nsed of liberation.</p>
<p>In India, philosophy originates when a man feels a need or erano ipation, when he desires something nore than the objects of the ordinary interest. Thus the Hindu philosophy acog</p>
<p>not find its origin in the love of wisdom cr in the desiro</p>
<p>to know something (Jinaga).</p>
<p>It comes into being wiona</p>
<p>man desires for proteotion from the wordly bonds. In the Wegt, philosophy means to achieve vision for its own saks. and not for any praotial purpose. The theoritical charac ter of philosophy has got much eraphasis and its practical aspect has been throw behind there. The case, in India, is different. The theory has been subordinated to the practice. It is the praotical aspeot of philosophy that inatters much in India. Practice has a full domination over theory. Thus theory and practice, or philosophy and re ligion have kept pace with each other. In most cases re ligion has preceded philosophy. In India, as a matter or fact, philosophy is founded on religion, faith and intuitivo experience. Indian thinkers neither advocate actless W12 dom nor support wisdonless acts. They are equally attaohod to aotion and contemplation. They are active first and then! contemplative. Individual rəis first of all, have got vision of the Absolute by their intuitive experienco. Later on, the same oxperience is philosophically ligoussed and its value 13 determined for the ordinary people. In India, the philosophies which are not based on the intuitive experience or taith, have got no long life. We should also beer the fact in mind that in some cases, religious exper ience comes after ratiocination (Vicara) which is supposed to be the function of philosophy. In the Vedanta, for example, we find that intuition (dargana) is supposed to come after meditation (Nididhyasana) which again follows ratiooination (Manana.). It does not matter much whether religious experience or intuition comes first and ratio</p>
<p>oination takes place after it, or meditation falls rirst and intuition 19 its fruition. The fact, which we have to emphasise in this connection, is the interrelation or</p>
<p>religion and philosophy.</p>
<p>In India, theory and practice</p>
<p>are Interwoven in every schoci or philosophy.</p>
<p>They aro</p>
<p>nover a Ivorced from each other in the six systems of the</p>
<p>Indian Philosophy.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, reason and intuition are not two separate things. They are regarded as two aspects or one attempt or approach. The ultimate goal of these two criteria is one, viz., Salvation. From this point or view, the aim of the Nyaya and Vaisegika, of the Sankhya and the</p>
<p>Yoza, of the Vedanta and Mimaasa, of the Buddhist and the Jain, is the game, 1.9., the attainment of the Highest and and complete emancipation from all miseries. It is very dirfioult to state that the Vedanta and the Sankhya are philosophies aná not religions. In reality, theory and practice are mixed in the six system of philosophy. Un doubtedly, in India, philoşophy and religion are but theori tioal and practical aspects or one attempt at realising the final end of life. Thus reason and faith or philosophy and religion should be regarded as two oriteria or the Righest truth.</p>

<li>According to Abhinava Gupta, philosophy or jnana is that by which the knowledge or the fundamental Unity or absolute whole (Purna Prathatnaka) is obtained. This jnana is said to be or two kinds, that is, baudaha (related to budahi or intellect) and paurusa (related to Purusa or spirit). Both intellectual and spiritual jnana</li>
</ol>
<p>are required for the supreme goal in the saiya philosophy.</p>
<p>Tither of them will not autrice.</p>
<p>Similarly the Ajnana (Ignorance) has also two kinds paurusa ajñana and baud üha ajnana. By the paur uşa ajnana, we moun anava mala, which is intimately associated with Anu or individual solr. For its destruotion, Śaiva philosophy stresses Diksa. Suppose this afnana is</p>
<p>destroyed by Diksa and the anu 10 purified but Bauddha&rsquo; ajnene remeins in its active state, shall we get liberation? This question is answered by T.A. in the 1st.A. Tho des-, truotion of Paurusa Ajnane certainly brings freedom (inolaa) after the fall of this physical body. In life-time wo can not experience the state of liberation, because the bauddha a jngna exists and stands in the way or the true self realisation. Intellectually we do not know whether we are spiritualised or not. Thus for the attainment of livan</p>
<p>Mukti, the removal of the bauddha ajnana is indispensable,</p>
<p>As the disappearance of bauddha ajnana 1s 63822</p>
<p>tial for the realisation of Jlvan Mukti, similarly the doli verance from paurusa Ajnana is highly essential for the attainment of supreme liberation according to Śaiva school or thought. Suppose, we are elevated intellectually and spiritualised by the study of holy soriptures but our paurusa mala or anava taint remains in its active state,</p>
<p>shall we have supreme state as it is acceptable to the Śaiva School? Acoording to the school or the Vedanta, liberation 19 based on bauddha jnana on which it lays muoh</p>
<p>emphasis. From the Tantrika point of view, it is a mere freedom or vijnana kaivalya and not supreme state which can be obtained after the destruction or paurusa ajunans.</p>
<p>From whatever is stated above, it has to be noted :</p>
<p>that pa urusa jnana and bauddha jnana are interrelatod.</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>mere removal of paurusa ajnana by paurusa jnana will not</p>
<p>bring jivan mukti. Similarly the destruction of bauddha ajnana by bauddha jnana cannot achieve gupreme state.</p>

<p>From the vurious doctrines mentionod in the following pages, we are sure to believe that they are not mere formulas. Their deep spiritual eignificance cannot be ignored. The philosophical illustrations of the system are entirely related to the inner experience.</p>
<p>(I) Philosophy of seven promatrs mainly points out seven grades of Sadhakas according to their spiritual capacity. These stages, viz., Sakala, pralayakala, vijnanakale, mantra, mantresvara, mentrar ahegvara and Siva, as a matter of fact, are direct references to tho gradual spiritualisation of aspirants.</p>
<p>mentre</p>
<p>ASV</p>
<p>Of these seven Praratrs, the 3akala is the lowest</p>
<p>experienoer which represents et symbol or completo materia</p>
<p>lity and diversity.</p>
<p>The Pranata of this class regains in</p>
<p>volved in tha three ripur itios, 1.e., angve, karma and mayiya. It is the stage of unboundei diversity.</p>
<p>The Pralayakala Prematr has the same qualities,</p>
<p>which are found in the Sakala, except one Karmamala. This experiencer also has no possibility of deliveranoo und 11 the</p>
<p>diesolution takes place.</p>
<ol start="48">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The vijnanakala 13 the third state in the ascent to the supreme Pramatr, sive, into which for the first time, the idea of the subjective unity begins to peep and which is far superior to the states, already mentioned. Only anava Mala (innate ignorance) dominates it, while the other two taints come to an end. As a matter of fact, it is an intermediate state of duality and non-duality (dvaita-dvaita.), The Pramatr 1s gaid to be between the two tattvas, i.o., pure and impure (Mayordhvam suddha vidyadhah).</p>
<p>&hellip; The Mantra Pramatr is a bit better than tho Vijnanakala. The tendency of this Pramatr is more inward than that available in the preceding Pramatr. The anava mala, which a bounds in the Vijnanakala, begins to proceed towards destruotion. The idea of perfect unity appears in its wavering state, that is, sometimes, it appears whilo at others it disappears. The full balanced tranco (Hirvi kpaka Samadhi) of Yoga, which is experienced in the next higher Pramata is yet very far.</p>
<p>In the Mantresvara state, the derilement anava is in the position of being destroyed (ahzansamana). The Sad haka of this state begins to realise the subjectivo unity whioh pervades the whole universe including him. But perfect onenegg has not yet got hold of his inner</p>
<p>being. His mind is more bent on the subject than that in the Mantra state.</p>
<p>In the Mantramehegyara state, the Anava Mala 13</p>
<p>destroyed (Dhvasta). It is a perfect state of the mental balance from which all thoughts or dirferentiation begin to disappear. The Sadhaka at this stage does not find any divergence between his self and the sell of tho universo. It is a high Yogio trance from which a fall is rarely expected. We can technically term it as a &ldquo;Turiya state.</p>
<p>*49.</p>
<p>No doubt there is a oneness of the subject and object in it but the supreme oneness or the idea of the impergonal God which has been described as beyond all human approaches und which has been designated as &ldquo;pure&rsquo; or &lsquo;Turiyatita&rdquo; is yot to be obtainable.</p>
<p>The siva state is the last one in which the ascend -</p>
<p>ing effort of the lower Prametrs stops.</p>
<p>On the one hand,</p>
<p>it is a starting point and on the other, it is a destination also. The supreme prino iple begins his downward march and</p>
<p>the phenomenal universe 19 manifested.</p>
<p>It 19 called</p>
<p>Sangara or jagat. When the same High Reality begins to agoend, the manifested World is withdrawn into it. It is</p>
<p>called dissolution or Pralaya. For Its independent desa cent and agcent, the Svatantrya Sakti or free will or It is responsible. No foreign element or stimulus is needed for this twofold process as it happens by its own free will. Thus this w111 or Iocha sakti of the Lord is an instrument in the evolution of the universe of Phenomena in the scrip ture Samud radi jagat krtsnam parivarta yatiochaya”.</p>
<p>The Siva state is really ever-existent and over blessed, and supreme oneness prevails in it. It is a puro Advaita or &lsquo;Paramadvaita&rsquo;. According to this state tho separate experiences of &lsquo;you&rsquo; and &lsquo;I&rsquo; disappear. There 13 no more the idea of siva, Sakti and Nara. The only on perience that emerges from this State ig &ldquo;I am alls. The name and form owing to which the ever-blessed one experian des itself as many are removed. The only thought that revives in this state is &lsquo;I am Siva and I exist everywhere. &lsquo;Myself 19 Śiva&rsquo;. Śaiva philosophers call it Ātma-Liiga or Saiya-linga which is said to be worshipped. It must bo stated in this connection that the Phallus workship prova</p>
<p>lent among the Hindus at present is a mere symbol or this</p>
<ol start="50">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>supreme Saive State.</p>
<p>Dr. K.C.Pandey has mentioned eight pranatrs in his work &ldquo;A.H.P.S.&rdquo; page 164-5. According to la., tho</p>
<p>pramatrs are seven and the doctrina OL pancadasa vidhi 19</p>
<p>based on them.</p>
<p>(II) It is not out of place to mention tha three popular Lingas specially referred to by the advocates or the Kashmir saivism to be worshipped for the self reall sation.</p>
<p>The first Linga called &lsquo;Apara Linga! or &ldquo;Vyalta Linga&rsquo; is a symbol of an exoterio Sadhana (Bahiranga Sadhana) in which external objects are emphasised to be worshipped. This linga is meant for the Sadhakas who are beginners. It is an elementary stage acoording to whioh, emphasis has been laid on the object-factor. The process of this Vyalta Linga, prescribed for beginners, correspond to the well known anavapaya, one of the three means mentioned for the realisation of the self in saivism. The worship of the &lsquo;Apara Linsa&rsquo; implies the duality which has got hold of spiritual seekers. In this stege subject and object aro understood as two separate entities.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The gecond Linga is termed as &ldquo;Vyaktavyakta&rsquo; or &lsquo;Parapara Linga&rsquo; and corresponds to the Sakt opaya prescribed&rsquo; for the saühakas or Sakti State. The state refers to tho unity-in-diversity. The distinctions between the subjeot and object begin to disappear. This Liriga is superior to the previous one. From this state, the esoteric (Antaranga)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sadhana, which is specially associated with the spiritual</p>
<p>realisation, begins.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The third linga designated as &lsquo;avyakta. Or</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;Para Linga&rsquo; is condentsi with the Sambhavopaya&rsquo;, mentioned</p>
<ol start="51">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>for the highest apirants. In this state all diversities</p>
<p>come to an end. The subjootive unity emerges out. It is the state or perfect harmony where suprene Reality pro dominates.</p>
<p>(III) So far as the philosophy for the work in</p>
<p>concerned., seven ways (Vidhi), connected with the above</p>
<p>mentioned geven classes of the experiencers, aro siven a special inportance in order to approach the hichest Reality. The first and the lowest way, 1.0., Panoudaga Viahl, is prescribed for the Sakala Pramatr who is totally involved in the three impurities and who represents the worst possible form of the Pr&rsquo;amatr. According to the Pancadasa Vidhi, geven Pranatrs with their saven Skatis bogin their practice on the object, whion is technically called a Sya rupa or form. This dharana or Pancadasa Vidhi is meant</p>
<p>for materiolistio type, full of Sadhakas or the three</p>
<p>Males and revolving round matter.</p>
<p>The second way, Trayodaga Vidhi is said to be useful for the Pralayakalas, who with the other rive Pramatrs and their Saktis begin to meditate on the object, which, in this case, is 3 akala Prumatr with his Šalti. After the Pancadasa vidhi, the Sakala Pramatr with his Sakti losos his personal entity as a Promatr and assumos the form of an object or Svarupa in the Trayodagavidhi. The name of this way is the thirteontold method or trayo dasa Vidhi as it consists of six experiencers, viz., Iron Pralayankala to siva in ascending order with their sis $aktis and one object.</p>
<p>The third way, called the Ekadasavidhi&rsquo;, nouns</p>
<p>the rive measurers with their five Saktis and one Svarupa (Pralayakala with his Sakti) and represents the formation of the elevenfold method.</p>
<ol start="52">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>In Navuvidhi the vijnanakala with h19 Sakti bo.</p>
<p>comes a Svarupa and the other four Pramatrs with the 11 Saktis</p>
<p>rema in as experiencers.</p>
<p>All the four Pranatrs or this</p>
<p>olags belong to the pure creation of the fivo pura prinda ples, 1.e., Suddha Vidya Isvara Sada śiva, Śakti aná ģive.</p>
<p>According to the Saptavidhi, Mantra Pramatr with his Sakti becomes e Svarupa. The remaining throo Pramatrs</p>
<p>with their Saktis appear as experienoers.</p>
<p>In the Pancavidhi Mantramahesvara and Siva with</p>
<p>their respective Saktig are experiencers and tho Mantra</p>
<p>svara with his Sakti remains a Svarupa.</p>
<p>In the trividhi Siva, with his Sakti is experiencer</p>
<p>The Mantramanešvara with his Sakti become3 Svarupe.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>framing of these seven doctrines is reasonable because thoy</p>
<p>are useful for men of various temporamonts.</p>
<p>(IV) The philosophy or the five states, asoribed to the supreme Reality, is not less important. These states are also connected with the rive faces and the livs functions or the Lord Siva. As a matter or fact, siva in</p>
<p>his essential character, is unity and represents supramo</p>
<p>consciousness.</p>
<p>The five states are the variations of the</p>
<p>Reality and represent its five Saktis owing to which tho former appears as many in its Sangaridasa (creation). To should remember that the fundamental principle of the system is basically one and remains so in all its states which are mere aspects or grades of the same. The individual golves, anus or pudgalas, as they are stylcd by the exponents of the Philosophy, are not different from civa, who is bounded by his own mysterious Maya Sakti. It is a Sansari Stato Or</p>
<p>Siva, philosophically termed as Jagrat avastha or waking state. All the limited selves or the creation are in tho</p>
<ol start="55">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>waking gtete. • Objector-factor predominates hero (Cr. Moya&ndash;</p>
<p>bhumiriyem mukhya, T.A.).</p>
<p>The second state 19 Svapne avastha or dreaming</p>
<p>gtat 3.</p>
<p>Practically it is the same state which a man</p>
<p>experiences in a drear.</p>
<p>The idea oe the object which</p>
<p>prinar lly. pravall3 in the woling state begins to come. to en and. The Sadhaka, in this state, experiences the subjective idea, but its appearance is just as a dream.</p>
<p>In all respects the state is a bit better than the preceding one. It is a reprssentation of manabhumi (State or noaeuro)..</p>
<p>The third state is Susupta Avastha or dreamless sleep. The Sadhaka, in the state, is disconneoted from the impure creation or materiality though at the same tine the pure realm is still out of his reech. The approach</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>towurds self-roalisation starts from this state. vision of the inner spirituelity begins to dawa.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>state is technically called prematrbouri.</p>
<p>the fourth state or turiya-avastha represents the pure creation. The objective plurality a igappears. The</p>
<p>subiective domination is a distinctive characteristio OP the state. T.A. calls it prama bhumi.</p>
<p>The fifth is termed as Turiyatite&rsquo; in whion the</p>
<p>supreme consciousness or transcendent (Nisprapanca) Siva</p>
<p>is experionced. Malini has named it &ldquo;Sarvutita* or the state beyond all, the knowledge of which is said to be the os use of liberation (Bervatitah Sivojneyo Yam Viaitva Vimucyata). These five states are named variously and el barotately mentioned in the Ma. Adhi. II.</p>
<p>(7) The Trika system lays much emphasis on tho &lsquo;Atman!. According to the followers of the Śaiva though, all that is found in the macrocosm, should be realis od 1</p>
<p>the microcom.</p>
<p>For the realization of the sixtold road</p>
<p>($adadhvand the founders of the school have framed three ways &lsquo;Aparı&rsquo;, &lsquo;Parapara&rsquo; and &lsquo;Para&rsquo; which represent three olasses or Sadhakas (dvaita, dva itadvaita, advaita) respoo tively.</p>
<p>Accoriing to the Apara method, the body or the</p>
<p>Sadhaka, from his feet to the forehead, is supposed to be</p>
<p>eighty-four fingers and all the tattvag of the sixtold road</p>
<p>are said to be realised in the space above mentionsd.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>method is meant for the Dvaitists.</p>
<p>In the Parapara method, which is applied to the followers or Dvaltadvaita, the human body, from the root to Brahma Randhra is thought to be of 96 fingers and all the tattvas are deemed to be existing in that space.</p>
<p>The Para method is the best type of monisia.</p>
<p>Tho</p>
<p>himan Microscam, according to it, from feet to Bramma Rand hrs., should be supposed to be or 98 fingers upto Branda Randhra, and beyond it twelve fingers more should be added to this measure and thus the whole measurement is 108 fingers. The method signifies that the supreme Roality is equally preveding the microcosm and macrocoSI (For</p>
<p>deta11 see notes on the 8th adhi.).</p>
<p>(VI) The mention of the various abaranas (concon&ndash;</p>
<p>trations) on the phenomenal objects provos that tho Śaiva philosophy does not nezleot even the meanest thing or the universe. The followers of the School regari everything an a form of Sive and therefore they prescribe cherana sven on the Phallus (Lina) ideally whioh is by no means a guesablo to the civilised olasg of thinkers. According to popular belief, everything of the World, whether it is conscious or unconscious, 18 identical with Siva. They deny nothing.</p>
<ol start="55">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>they have deified all the objects of the world.</p>
<p>This idea</p>
<p>of the deittention 13 a dominant factor in the mention or</p>
<p>the various dharenas.</p>
<p>(VII) The Anavopaya (Lit. related to anu or in dividualsal) emphasizes the physical efforts to be made by tine Frematrg of the Sakalavastha or materialised state for anlvation).</p>
<p>The Saktopaya is a combination pr physical as well as mental efforts and represents dvaitndvaita state.</p>
<p>The Sambhayopaya consists of the mental efforts</p>
<p>and 1s exclusively meant for those who are spiritually</p>
<p>awakened by their preceptors and think the universo to ba Śivamaya (full&rsquo; or Śiva).</p>
<p>(VIII). As regards thə projection of physical universe, the frika School holds that the universal con ciousness (cit) 1n the sole independent cause of it. The qualities, inch as, Sarvakrttva&rsquo; (all-doer ship) Sarva jnatya (all knoworship) -eto. are attributed to all pervading principle. It is a unique and singular characteristic or Indian Philosophy that it has reduoed the whole phenomenal show of the material world into one ultimate Reality, which 18 all consciousness (cit). The view of the modern philo</p>
<p>sophers that the universe is a creation of the mind is not</p>
<p>accepted by the founders of the Trila system. According to them, the mind is not different from oonsciousness (Cic) which has descended from its essential nature (citanapada) and has passed into a stage of limitation. This universal consoiousness has two aspects, Prakasa and vimarśa. This &ldquo;Prakasa&rsquo; aspect in its gradual manifestation from its . essential nature, comes down and appears as pasu who in his gradual agcent is transformar to sivahood. The doctrine of seven Pramatrs is based on this gradual ascent,</p>
<ol start="56">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>(IX). The will or Siva is regarded as &ldquo;Svētantrya Sakti&rsquo; or free will, to which, the causality of the apparent phenomena is asoribed. According to the Tantrika theory or creation, the projection (srsti), stability (sthit 1) and destruotion (Samhara) of the universe rely on this trao will of the All-controlling - Reality. The supreme Reality, of which the world is a mere sport, has been admitted absolute and transo endent. It is the divine will that</p>
<p>creates a desire for enjoyment in the limited sell (vijnana. Kevala), who is not different from Siva Himself. Thus the World is a round created by Him through His free will or</p>
<p>sportive nature.</p>
<p>In this connection, a similar statement of Dr. Radhakrishnan who does not accept Karman and Pralrt1 as.</p>
<p>prompting cause and material cause respectively and supports the will of the Lord for the creation of the Universe, is quoted below:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The existence of a prompt ing cause, liko Karman, or material eause like Prakrti, for the creation of the World is not admitted. Nor is Maya tha principle which creates illusory forms. God 13 absolutely independent and creates all that exists by the mere foros or His W111&rdquo;. I.P. Vol.II.</p>
<p>(x) The philosophio point, on which Veasnt in and Śaiva philosophers equally lay much stress, is the doctrine of Sakt ipata or divine grace. In this connection tho Upanisads, which are the monuments of Indian philosophia thinking have the following estimate of the same.</p>
<p>Nayamatma Pravacanena labhyo na medhaya na</p>
<p>vahunam Srutena yameva isa vrnute tena La inyo Yasm9 l vivrute Svam Tanum.</p>
<ol start="57">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>All efforts of an aspirant for the sall reall sation are useleag unless Sakti descenas end delivers hin from his earthly life. The intuitive vision, whion has a tremendous Importance in the sonool, is the ohior rector.or apiritual uplift. Tantraloka has olagsfried it under theo heads, viz. Manda, Tivra and Tivratara. Malini has also mentioned that the Sadhaka under tivratara Sakti Peta a los atonco and becomes siva. Besides, Malini ordinarily mentions the marks of those who are united with the Rudra Sakti.</p>
<p>(XI) The conception of the absoluto, admitt så by the Trika School, basically differs from that of the advaita Vedanta. From the Trika point of view, it is a united whole of two aspeots, called static and dynamic&hellip; The latter chiefly represents freedom or Svatantrya Sakt 1 of the absolute. The absolute or the Vedanta consists or static aspect, totally free from dynamism, This freedom ghould not be regarded as a separato sub stanoe from the absolute. This dynamiem 18 inseparable, in its quiescent state, from the absolute. Most of the Śaiva Scholurg, on this basis, have attributed to it tho qualities, similar to those of the absolute. The dynami of the absolute evolves itself in five cruies, called five Saktis, viz., cit, ananda, iocha, jnana and kriya. Tho dootrine or the five funotions, 1.6., projection, stable 11ty, destruction, grace and concealment, is intimately associated with the rive Saltis, due to which siva in held as Pancavidha Krtyakarin. The amanic theory or the five faces, assignsit to Siva, is deonly conneotod with the dynamism of the absolute, which evolves itself in the five states in its creative movement.</p>

<p>-tinguishes it from the Vedantio absoluto 1s its suprono ezoity (Paruhanta). It is also based on the theory 01 movement or dynami3m. In the Vedanta, partect woity (parahenta), in any caso, is not attributed to the Supremo Reality, the Brahman because the dynamism is not accepted by the system.</p>
<p>(XII) The theory of becoming or the dootzino or Manifestation, recognised by the Trike, is oonnected with the two modes, being and becoming, or the Supreme Reality, Parana şiva. The manifestation or the phenomenal universe, from the Trika point of view, is but en expression of tho 18848, or more oorrectly, the experience, or Parana siva, a united whole of being and becoming, toohnically under.. stood as prakasa (11luminating aspect) and vimarśa (che 11lumined). The apparent multiplicity or the phenomenal universe is a developed form of the becoming aspect (v imarsa), intrinsically related to the absoluto, Parana : 3 iva. This process of manifestation is technically callod A bìaga (Lit. Shining out), as opposed to the Vivarto (Lit. whirling) of the advaita Vedanta. In other words, the term (vivarta) means mappearing in diversa fore&rdquo;. This only difference between the two may be stated as follows:</p>
<p>According to the founders of the Vivuite, tha</p>
<p>appearances are mere names and forma (Nem rupamatre). and</p>
<p>can under no olroumstances be regarded as real. From tho Vedantio point of view, they are quite different from the Supreme Brahma, rogurded as conso iousness. They are the produotion of Maya or illusion, recognised a8 ingorutablo in the School. Moreover, the position of maya in tho. School is peculiar. It is neither existent nor non existent. The School of the advaita Vedanta regards $8</p>
<p>as Sadagadanirvadaniya.</p>
<p>It is hela as a more adjunog52.</p>
<p>(upadhi)..</p>
<p>It is both, unconscious and unreal bcouuso 1.</p>
<p>has no relation to the Brahman, regarded as conscious (cit svarupa) and real. The world of names and forma, produced by maye, from the Vedantic point of view, is false and uno ons o ious (Sada).</p>
<p>The position of the parinamavad in algo dirtex&rsquo;s from the Vedanta. The Sankhya Sohool holds that tho world</p>
<p>is real because it is the oreution or prakrti, regarded eternul. But as regards the nature of prakrti, 1t 10. said to be material (jada). From the point or viow or Surkhya, the world is simultaneously real and aoic (sada).</p>
<p>From the Trika point of view, the world is both real as well as conscious (cit). It is the creation or Sakti, regarded congoious and real. Besides, the justi. fication of the a bha se vadin is that the world was alroady. existent in Siva in its embryonio form. (0r. Vartamana vabhaganem bhavan anava bhaganam. Antah sthituvutaneve</p>
<p>ghatate vohirotmana, I. Pr. 32). The view or PT. HT 1s algo similar to that mentioned above in conneotion with the a bhagavada. The author of the work has used the term unmilena&rsquo; for a bhaga or shining out. Tho common</p>
<p>tator has explained the term as under:</p>
<p>Unmilanam avasthita syaiva prakatikaranam.</p>
<p>(XIII). The conception of the şudadhvan OP 01 -</p>
<p>told road, from the Tantrike point of view, is regardca an obstruction to self-knowled me (adhva vand hasya keranan). Ag refards its nature, it consists or two parts, called, vaonka (Sabda) and vacya (artha), mutually connected with each other. There are three stages or the ovolution or the vacaka (sabda) and they correspond to tho throo COOH</p>

<p>we find may be expressed in the following tarmu: -</p>
<ol>
<li>Varna is a minimus divisible, unit or Sabia</li>
</ol>
<p>and it is entirely associated with the Kala, a minimus divisible unit of artha. On a study of the parallel lino</p>
<p>or evolution, we find an internal relation existing beton</p>
<p>mantras and padas on one hand and with tho tattved and bhuvanas on the other. A br ist account and the nua bax, or varnas, mantras and padas as well as of the Kal08 tattvad and bhuvanas are given below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Varnes, regerded as Sektis, aro, Prom tho. Tantrika point of view, firty. Their individual oign picance is much emphasised in the Tantras and they are tachnioally understood as matrka. In connootion with the origin or latrkus or varna, we must rører to the Para Sakti or the Logos, regarded as Pars Vak, whit getininally contains all Sastrag and words in it. It is supremo state wherein all words are lantent in their wdirroren tiated form. It is an inherent nature or Sive and in this supremo state it oannot be distinguishod trou ta&rsquo; ultimato source. From the evolutionary point or risk its second state is Pasyanti won words (Saba) tid thoir meaninge (artha) are separated intornully. The statue</li>
</ol>
<p>in comparison with the previous one, ls, no doubt it diererentiated because sabda and arths aro separated in the form or Sabda and Artha but their this qual formation in at111 implioit. They have not st111 &amp;seta sd the design nation of væoaka and vaoya. In short, thone se dau of dirrerontiation in this etato. P.T. has cleri</p>
<p>ho position or Pasyanti in the words - bhedanaesyaturunan.</p>
<ol start="61">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The state is said to be just like the muterial, existing in the age of a peacock, whion in its ex br yonio form is not dirrerentiated (cr. Mayurandurasopama).</p>
<p>The third state of the Para vak 1. madhyama when separate units or sabda ana artba are formed. In this state, they appear in the form or vacanta and vaaya separately. P.T. has defined the stato by one tern,</p>
<p>bhedava bhasa&rsquo;, whioh literally means the appearance of duality. Sabda and artha are, a bit, externalised but they have not yet assumed the position of perfect sepa ration. They are still linked by ono uniting thread. In this stat., they are internally spoken and they oonvoy their meanings also. Physical ears can not hear them., 1.1. defines the stato as under :</p>
<p>antah suin jalparüpa tu na srotramupasarpati.</p>
<p>The words or P.T. (or. Madhyamapade atmu iva samsrnoti naparah) in connection with tho madhyama ar. ro markable. All our sastras remain stored in this state and are revealed through some med i um. State is specially associated with the yogins or high status.</p>
<p>In the Vaikhari Vak, regarded as the fourth state of the supremo spoooh, Sabdas and arthas outwardly appear and become known as vãoaka and vaaya. The state corres ponds to the Matrka or Varna stege and P.T. states it as tri ed asphutata (full appearance of differentiation).</p>

<li>Mantras, from the evolutionary point of view, are a developed form of varna. An approach to self roalisation through there is a bit grosser than that through the former. Ordinar lly, nantras ar. innumerabi. but from the tantrika point of view, their number is oloyon. As ;</li>

<p>Tantrika oulture is intimately $9900iated with the cultivation of mantras (saored fornulas) on the one</p>
<p>hand and Yantras (diagrams) on the other. Mantras repre sent the combined form of spiritual nature and yantras stand for moohanism and moohanioul devices through which those roroes can be asserted and made to fimotion on the physioul plune. A yantre is, thorororo like a maohina whereas the mantra is a motive power which gives it motion. Mantras are composite foroes expreguoj through sounds or phonetio symbols and consist of certain primal energies emanating from the Absolute. These onargius manirust i themselves on the highest plano us spiritual wound which 18 a poouliar oharsoter, pertaining to each aound.

The proosus whion donverts letters or sounds into Nada 1. identioal with th. process which givos lire to the Mantra and makes them potent. Ultimately the Nada which begins to runotion in Madhyama vak beoomes intensified in the higher state or Pasyanti and becomes one with its object. As a result or this method or pur irioutlon every mantra baoomes sublimatod Into the basio state and the Sadhaka or Yogi is converted 11kewise lato the state of Mantrodvera, Mantra Mabesvara or even siva.

<p>transform an ordinary man into the divine status of siva and lead him to suprena Reality.</p>

<li>Padas. The third form of vioakadhvan is padas, regard od as grossost development of the varnas, from which no further evolution 18 possible. Like varnas and mantras, they are also intimately related to the con caption of Kaladhran or time. Their number, generally accepted by the Tantrika Sohool, 18 eight yone. A seoker of the truth, according to the Tantrika Sadhana, has to start from pades, whion closely correspond to the anayopaya, ordinarily a lowest means, pregoribed for a Sadhake or materialised type.</li>

<dt>As alreudy mentioned, vaayadhvan consists of Kala, tattvas and bhuvanas. The oreation of these principles is groggar then the former. A brief account of the principles belonging to this group is as under:</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Kala is said to be an energy of siva. The Sakala or immanent state of Purama Siva is due to this energy. When it transcends or is beyond this tattva, it is oelled niskala or transcendent. The number the Kala is five. The first kala from the point of view of desoont, 18, avakasada and 18 related to Siva tattya. The supreme stute of this tattva 18 Paralla $iva, regarded as niskala.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The second kala, called santa, is directly related to Sarti prinoiple. Bodhini, pratestha and nirvrtti kalas are connected with the maya, prakrti and chara respeotively. The nirrtti kala is the last develop ment from which no further development is possible. ,</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<p>Further development of Kala is tattvas,&hellip; related to mantras. As regards their number, they are</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>thirty-six and are arranged in three croups, called, juddh, yuddhasudha und asuddha. Tuo division is ohiorly con nected with the domination or oit-tattra.</p>
<p>The Supreme Principle, to which the origin of various tattyus 18 ascribed, has been called Purama siya. It is one but becomes nany by its own freedom (avatantrya hetutan, Tr1. R. jna. Khu. 58). As a matter of fact, the supreme is rexarded as a united whole of static (conscious noss) and dynamio aspects (free w111). The nature or tho second agroct 18 threefold, oit sakti, maya sakti and jada sakti. The first state is transcendent, regarded as nirvikalpaka. The second state represents vikalpa bh liaukhya dasa. The third state, oallod jada bakti, is referred to by various numea, such as, avidyo, mulavidya or tumus (darkangs). It oniorly represents vikalpadeda and the origin of different oatogories owes to it.</p>

<p>(II). Every monistio school of India has tried its best to explain the complicated problóm or the one-way</p>
<p>in its own way. The method adopted by the non-dual school</p>
<p>of the Kashmir Saivism 18 unique and 86 Eng logically quits</p>
<p>sound. The supreme consciousness in the sense or Purata Siva is a byolutely free from time (Kala) and spaoo (desu). This samy it is regarded as a back ground of the. It is natural that the self-expression or the one as many is not possible unless the para Sanvit or the statio condo loudness is invested with Spapda (flutter or vibration) and appears as prana.

<ol start="71">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>prana rather in Samvit although every manifestation has,</p>
<p>for its basic background, samvit itself. The prana Sakti is divine power primarily or the nature of Kriya Sakti. The appearance of the body ay conscious footuna)</p>
<p>is not because consciousness pervadeg it but Locauso It</p>
<p>is permeated with prana which is the manifestation or the</p>
<p>Supreme Power as Kriya Sakti.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned that the Supreme Prinoiple is statio in its basio character. It is free from conceptions of time and space. Krama or Buooession is the chief characteristic of Kriya Sakti, developed from the Supreme Principle in the form or Para Samvit. Now it is easily explicable how both, tine and space or Kala and desa are associated with Friya Sakti and not with any other Sakti. Krama or succession as property of Kriya Sakti is</p>
<p>twofold, viz., abstract and concrete. The existonos or Krama or suo 0 ession as units of abstract motion or ideas explain our notion of time. But the existence or the same succession as concrete units, co-existing and forming varie ties in body-consoience, accounts for the conception of space. The two lines of evolution as a bytract and oonorate, are parallel and interelated in every way. In wr the order of Kala or time, we find IRMX Varna, mantra and pada, for these all are connected with the uoohara (11t. pronunoiation) which implies an utterance of sounds and refers to the succession of events in time. But the principles or Kala, tattva and bhuvana, which correspond to varna, mantra and pada respectively, belong to the order of space and not to the order of time. Thus all our ideas, abstraot and con orete, are unified in a single experience dominated by tine and space.</p>
<p>From what has been said above, it is evident</p>
<p>that every finite experience is ultimately based upon the conception or time and spece from which the Suprema Expor ience is only exempt.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>In the foregoing paties orrorts are made to expose the doctrinal points the work has dealt with. They are not mere theories and intellectual digoussions, which we usually rind in the ph1losophioul treatises, but</li>
</ol>
<p>they have their practical essence also.</p>
<p>The work, as we</p>
<p>have studied, mainly represents the tantrika roligion, generally consisting of the four fundamental principles, viz., jnan (philosophy), yoga, kriya and carya. They colloctively and individually help us to achieve the ultimate goal of life.</p>
<p>As regards the function of philosophy, it surfices to say that it, acoordina to the Eastern thinkers, 1s not a thing of intellect only as the Western philoso phers take it. India never admits that it, apart from its intellectual equipment, does not serve any purpose of life. It is understood as an essence or life. We oun emphatically say that philosophy is one of the essential principles of hunan life. It analyses life and enables to know what we are. By philosophy, we can discover the gecrets lying in the supreme solr. It diutinguishes the self from non-self and teaches man that he is, as a matter or fact, intrinsically related to the universal solr.</p>
<p>The term, yoga, in the tantras, is generally understood as a soience or unirioation. Ma. has also stressed this sense (or, yogamekatvamioohanti vastuonyana vastuna, ma. IV, 4.). It teaches us various methods or identification. The present work has laid down tho : principles of twofold d 1ksa by which an aspirant can be</p>
<p>identified with the Supreme Principle.</p>
<p>The third principle, according to the Tantrika Sadhane, for self-realisation is Kriya. The doctrina of Kriya points out how a spirituul seeker should not for</p>
<p>the attainment or the suprema unity. Iractioa or mantra</p>
<p>and vamayoga and celebration or ritual ceremonies are entirely recognised a9 parts of this section.</p>
<p>The carya part of the tantrika &lsquo;Sadhana chiefly</p>
<p>dealt with the convential practices (Samaya) which the</p>
<p>seekers of Truth have to observe during the period or their</p>
<p>meditation. The dootrine of carya teaches Sadhakas how to live in the course of their spiritual training.</p>
<p>(o) The Ma. Sohool is regarded as monistic and therefore every approach to it is to be considerad from the same point of view. The supreme aim or hunan being 19 attainment or perfection and the perfection 13 nothing but self-realisation or man of supreme stute which is absolutely divine. Ma. and gayertha, the commentator or T.A. have referred to this state by their two respective terms, 3varupasthiti (or. Suidhe avatmani tisthati, Mu. I</p>
<ol start="47">
<li>and Svarupaprathana (cf. Mokso hi nama raivunyuh</li>
</ol>
<p>svarupaprathanam hi san. Svarupam catmanah say it &hellip;. 1.A. I, 31, Com). It is believed that God or Parama Siva has assumed the role of a man after self-11m 1tation and the object of man&rsquo;s life is to do away with the 1 in itations and return to his real status as Parama Siva. To remove the</p>
<p>bonds, the individual efforts alone on the part of man are</p>
<p>not sufficient unless they are affected by divine grace</p>
<p>(Sakti-pata). Sometimes, but in rare oages, Sakti functions almost exclusively to spiritualise Sadhakas. In most cases, this divine grace affects spiritual efforts in accordance with the varying capacity of the individual</p>
<p>concerned.</p>
<p>It 19 a fot that una ided efforts or a man are</p>
<p>ne no avall in this field because the removal of self induced obstruction 19 possible through will and the</p>
<p>aotivities of the ultimate source alone.</p>
<p>As a matter</p>
<p>or fact, the basis of this divine intervention is freedoin,</p>
<p>conceived as a svatantrya sakti or free will or the lord</p>
<p>Siva in the system.</p>
<p>Both, self-contration and self</p>
<p>expansion, are, in all cases, affected by divine hand.</p>
<p>Besides, in connection with liberation, as it is already mentioner, one has to bear in mind the theory of twofold jnana (spiritual and intelleotual) and twofold ignorance (paurusa and bauddha). The removal or paurusa</p>
<p>a jnana or innate impurity, called anavamala, is not possible by any effort on the part of man though the removal of the intellectual ignorance may be alrected by hunan efforts, as penance, physioal exercises, pranayama etc., and mahavakya-jnana (knowlodge given by a Guru), mentioned in the Yosa School of Patanjali and the advaita</p>
<p>Vedanta of Sankara respectively. The rise of bauddha</p>
<p>jnana, which d is pels the intellectual ignorance, is, in fact, an absurdity unless it is preceded by the elimination of the spiritual a jnana, helped by divine grace through a Guru. The destruction of the spiritual ignorance is more important, from the Tantrika point of view, than the des truction of the intellectual ajnana. As we experience, without the latter, Sivetva or divinity is ags uned after the end of the present body. The lack of the intellectual Jnana is only an impediment in the way of realisation or fivarmukti (liberation in life).</p>
<p>The conception of liberation (mukti), from the Śaiva point of view, is briefly nentioned. This oonoeption is absolutely different from that of the advaita Vedanta,</p>

<p>The supreme state, achieved through the intellectual jnane (baud dha nena) according to the Vedanta, 18 not agreeablu to the advaite Saive philosophers. They call it atmia or spiritual state, free from all impuritios. This counci pation from the level of tattvas iu a pure knowledge or Suddha vijnana kaivelya. Saive scripturas describe it as under:- &ldquo;givo Tai ka ivalastatra atina jnana - kriyanvitan.</p>

<p>S.T. 4th. P.388-9.</p>
<p>3 imilarly, the state of puro oreation, from Su vidya to Sakti, 13 not fuvoured by the Sohool as a supreme status. The state does not imply the perfect unity between the inale and kriya, which the sohool calls the Bupreme state. There is an experienes of both, jnana and</p>
<p>kriye separately in this Su. vi. state,</p>
<p>Even the Siva state is not recognised by the Sohool, as the Supreme state. In the Siva state, both,</p>
<p>consciousness and freedom are experienoed a bit separately. The State, no doubt, points out the domination of the oit tettva, the static aspect of Perena Siva and apparently seems superior to those already mentioned but it is no</p>
<p>perfect unity between the Jnan and kriya, which the Sohool</p>
<p>has conceived as the Supreme state. The highest stata held by the Ma., is full equilibriun between the jnana and kriya (static and dynamic aspaots). The state represonts perfect balance or 31va and Sakti and is technioally called as Parama Siva or Siva-Sakti-Samarasya.</p>
<p>The author of s.r. mentions it as a state, beyond the approach of mind and sensas (Sarvandriya mano tita). The chier characteristio of this supreme unity 1s &lsquo;a bhava&rsquo;. The commentator of the work, with th13 view</p>
<p>that readers may not take the term in the sense of sunya or void, has clariried its meanings. The term refers to the state where all ideas or jnana or snaya totally cease (or. Na vidyante vod yad irupa bhava yatru, 3.T. 4th, 277, 0.3.). The text has also olariried the sense or &ldquo;abhava. lot. Abhayah so samudd isto yatrs bhavah ksayan gatah, 3&rsquo;,T. 4th., 282). The state ohiefly means where all distinctions, Buch as, pranieya, pramana eto. disappear (Na vidyate preme yodi prapanco yatra). The system has named it as sarvatita</p>
<p>or tatt vatita gtute (cr. sarvatituh 31vo jneyo yan vid 1tva</p>
<p>vimuoyate, Ms.).</p>
<p>As rerurds the process of the attainment of the ultimate poel, the advaita school of Suivism generally</p>
<p>believes in the Iadual ascent, which, 28 matter of fact,</p>
<p>starts from the atma state and ends in the Parama Siva state</p>
<p>but the instances of a sudden spiritualisation are also</p>
<p>found.</p>
<p>To have a correot estimate or the liberated state</p>
<p>according to the Śaiva School, we must take the doutrine of supreme osoity (parahantu) into consideration. The Śaiva system admits that the supreme state is charaoteris ed</p>
<p>by supreme aharta, regarded as a united whole of two i ulements, consciousness and freedom. The Vedanta dos</p>
<p>not hold freedom as a chief characteristic of Brahman. is a result of this the supr eine status of this gohool is a mere statio state with no supreme egoity, which is sbsolutely associated with the dynamic character. The experience of perfeot ego ity in the supreme state in the</p>
<p>Kashmir Salva School of philosophy 19 positive due to</p>
<p>dynamism, admitted ag an aspect of the Supreme Reality.</p>
<p>Association of jnana and Karma as Saktis is a</p>
<ol start="77">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>peculiarity of the triple thought. Bondage and freedorn are based on these two prinoipla3. Like the muyavada of Sankara there is no foreign element for the creation of bondage. Both liberation and bondage, are self-made. The conception of mukti or supreme state, according to the Trika School, is balance of consciousness and freedom, regarded as jnana Sakti and kriya Sakti. In the state or oreation, their balange is lost. The disappearance of the Supreme unity results in anava mala due to which the Para Pramatr, becomes pasu or bo und. The disturbance. between the jnana and the Karma occurs in two ways. Consciousness, devoid of Kriya Sakti, is according to the School, conceived as bondage. Kriya without knowledge is also bondage. Abhinava Gupta is right when he mentions the twofold nature of anava mela, viz., bodhatriya kriya and Kriyatriva bodha.</p>
<p>From the above, it is obvious that the equilibrium or gnana and kriya is moksa and its break gives rise to atrolka obscuration (anava) due to which the Inrinite be comes finite. The basis of this bondage and liberation, or self contraction and self-expansion, as matter of fact,</p>
<p>is freedom.</p>
<p>For the attainment of the supreme goal, mentioned above, the different schools of Sadhana and philosophy have adopted different ways. The schools of Sadhana in the West lay stress on meditation through whioh the true self is realised. According to the Bhakti school of Vaisnavas, supreme self is realised by means of love. Realisation by meditation and love means that something</p>
<p>is realised by something. This realisation implies that subjeot and objeot are different entities. This view or duality is not accepted by the non-dualistic schools.</p>
<ol start="78">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The Yora school of Patanjali has laid emphasis on. the physical means which help a spiritual Sadhaka to reach the Highest goal. The means adopted by Patanjali result in Samprafnata (objectful) and as amprafnata (objeotless tranoo) Samadhi. In any case, the object consoiousness does not disappear from an aspirant even in the two states of Samadhi, mentioned above. The Advaita school does not re cornise the method adopted by Patanjali. The sense of dualism which the school implies can not be denied.</p>
<p>The way for self-realisation according to the dual school of Sankhya is different. It does not depend on the physical means which the exponent of the yoga school recognises. From the Sankhya point of view, supreme realisation is obtainable through discrimination between</p>
<p>Prakrti and Purusa.</p>
<p>For this distinotiva knowledge of</p>
<p>Prakrti and Purusa, one has to rely upon higher specu lation.</p>
<p>The Nyaya school of Philosophy recommends argu mentation and Analytic knowledge of substances (Padarthas) to realise supreme self.</p>
<p>The founder of the Mimansa school has advocated the good deeds and Vedio terts as a chief means for selr</p>
<p>knowledge.</p>
<p>The author of the Gita has mentioned various</p>
<p>devices for self-realisation.</p>
<p>Various methods adopted by different forms of Sadhana for God-realisation imply that subjeot and object are separate. They worship God as an object though the underlying reality of whioh 18 oit, an all pervading psychio prino iple. It is also a worship or cit in disguise. The method of the Advaita Vedanta is70.</p>
<p>quite dirferent from those already mentioned.</p>
<p>It does</p>
<p>not proceed to worship God as an object. Its way for self-realisation begins with Cit direotly and realises 1t pure and naked. The Vedanta has conceive by God as Absolute spirit or Pure Cit. The School does not admit that God should be realised as an object. In that cuse He would be Jada or Nonself because all objets are non-gelf. The Vedanta believes in the worship of the Higher self by the lower selr (Jivataman). According to</p>
<p>the monistic School of Sankara the Atman 1s all-pervading principle. It should be worshipped by the puriried mind. The school prescribes the worship of the Cit by the Cit. Thus the Vedantic method of self-realisation is not attainment or something that was not or that is foreign to the self but 18 only the unfolding or the latunt in rinitude of the apparently finite. It is the working or Maya that the Absolute appears as the relative. The Infinite manifests itselr as the rinite and the Omnigoient seems in the disguise of the ignorant. It must be borne in mind that the finite can never be deduced from the Infinite and the rinite can never reach the Infinite. The Vedanta accepts that the Inrinite, which is distorted by Maya and which appears as the finite, realises its own infinitude in the state or liberation. For this self</p>
<p>realisation, the Vedanta has adopted various methods, viz.,&rdquo;</p>
<p>knowledge or Sastras, divine grace, Manana and Nididhya Sana of the Yoga school and Mahavakya jnana (knowledge given by Quru).</p>
<p>The Salva as well as the Tantrika way or sell realisation 18 absolutely dirferent from those mentioned a bove. Both admit that the Infinitudo 19 rinitised by its own Sakti. In the liberated state the Inrinitude realises ita iririnitud: malo realisation is obtainable</p>

<p>through various methods, such as, Sakti-pata, three upayas, concentrations eto. The votaries of the diksa school or 9.1. attaoh preference to the dikaa method. The Ma. . school also lays much emphasis on diksa and mentions that no aspirant 19 competent to be admitted into the Bankara Yoga unless he is initiated for the purpose (ot. Navadhi karita d1ksa vina yoge sti Sankare, Ma.). The method of diksa as a means to self-realisation, accepted by the Salva School is logically quite sound and based on the cono option of the Supreme Reality.</p>
<p>As regards the nature of dikga,a statement or</p>
<p>Javaratha, the commentator of T.A., explaining the whom etymological meaning of the term &lsquo;Diksa&rsquo; has stressed its dual function. The initiation outwardly and inwardly makes a Sadhaka quite fit for the spiritual journey. It imparts him sell-knowledge and destroys its inner-impuri ties (or. Diyete Jnanasad bhavah Ks iyante Pasuvasanah. Dana Ksapa gamyukta Diksa Tenaha Kirtita. Corom. T.A. lst. A. 43).</p>
<p>Another statement of the same commentator, similar to that mentioned above, asigns utmost iraportance to this ritual of Diksa which relieves a Sadhaka or the aixfold road (9 ad ahvan) and leads him to the status of Siva-Bhava (or. Tasmat Pravitated Bandhat Parasthana</p>
<p>Nirodha kat. Dikgaiva Mocayatyurdhvam Śaivam Dhama, Nayatyapi. Comm. T.A. lst, A. 43).</p>
<p>The conception of the sixtold road in the Śaiva thought is curious. It includes all parts of wateriality and 18 considered as bondage. A spiritual seeker oannot be identified with the supreme selr unless he has freed himselr from this bond.</p>
<ol start="81">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>From the close study or the statement oited in the previous Paragraph, we cannot hesitate to say that the function of Diksa is twofold, viz., Negative and positive. As rewards its negative function, it purifies the whole being of a Sadhake and enables him for spiritual reali sation. According to the canons of the Salva Philosophy, a Sadhaka must be purified by removing the various bonds (paga) which often stand in the way of spiritual uplift. This negative Diksa in the words or Svacenanda Tantra is called purifying initiation (Sodhan1 Diksa).</p>
<p>After the purifioatory Diksa which negates all the contents of the sixfold road as bonds (Pass), a Guru should begin the positive Diksa (called Yojani Diksa to unify the selr&rsquo; or a Sadhaka with the supreme Reality, Siva. At the very outset or Yojani Diksa, a Guru should make his pupil under his real, golf whioh is non-11cferent from Siva. In this rite, he ought to divert his attent ion from the Puryastaka which he has misunderstood as a seat of Parahenta or highest egoity. Similarly the mind which is understood as a centre or supreme Reality, must be negated. After crossing Puryastaka and the mind the third stage 18 &lsquo;void&rsquo; (Sunya) which 18 gone times mistaken as realm of Siva State. We cannot deny its supremacy over the Puryastaka and the mind but it is not a final desti. nation. The Sastre calls it a state of Sada siva. The unification or a Sadhaka with this state can result in a fall for. Sivasyordhe sivo Jneyo Yatra Yuktana Jayate. S.T.P. 4th. 197).</p>
<p>The two kinds, that is, Jnana and Kriya Diksa, mentioned by Ma in the 4th Adhi. are based on sound principles. They are assooiated with the conception or Anava Mala (innate def 11 ement). According to the Śaiva</p>
<ol start="82">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>thought, the balanced state of consciousnos8 (Jnana) and freedom (svatantrya Sakti) is regarded as &lsquo;Purema Siva&rsquo; state. In the state of creation (Sansara Dasa) this bulance is lost and appears in two dirferent ways. Wa call the consciousness (Jnana) dis associated from freedom (Friya) Anava Mala. Similarly freedoin without Jnana is also hnava Mala which arrects us in two ways. When in tellectually we fail to realise our trusself, it 18. bauddha Ajnana (related to intellect). When spiritually we do not understand our real nature, it is Paurusa (related to our inner spirit) Ajnana.</p>
<p>The Jnana Diksa removes our intelleotual impuri ties while the Kriya Diksa helps us to destroy the taints connected with our spirit. (Purusu Mala). Both of the initiation are interrelated. A mere knowledge or something has no use unless it is actualised by Practice. To prad</p>
<p>tise a thins without its proper knowledge has no value at ali. It is a l&rsquo;act that wisdom and action never divorce</p>
<p>from each other in the Şaiva Sohool or Thought.</p>
<p>(d) Both, the Saiya School of Kashmir and</p>
<p>Sankara&rsquo;s system do not seem different from each other</p>
<p>in their externals. We cannot deny the fact that they, both, represent idealistio monism. But the monisi or the Kashmir School is distinguished from Sankara&rsquo;s system in a most remarkable way. Sankara believes in the perfect unity of the Supreme Principle but he cannot, at the game time, do without the principle of maya without which the origin of Jiva and the world becomes inexplicable. Though the system is the monistio and therefore it implies the existence of one ultimate prinoiple. It is, no doubt, a fact that maya, in the system, doos not have a separata existence. The School of the advaita Vedanta doos not!</p>
<p>recogn130 it as an independent prinoiple. In thet ouse, the doctrine or nonian would surely sufrer. Consoquently Sankara holds maye to be inexplicabla baing neithor true nor false. This is the significance of the doctrine of fulsity which inherents in nayavada. The Kashmir Sohool on the other hand, is more extremist and steers clear of the dootrine or insorutability (anivaoaniyata) which outs at the root or nonion. As far as the question or mere 1s concerned, the Śaiva School of Kashmir &amp;inits one maya as a category of pura and in pure group. This maya 18 totally different from that or Sankara. This oute-. gorical maya comes under the thirty-six prinoiples and therefore it holds no ground to compete the maya or Bankera. Apart from this maya, the system does not hold anything except the Supreme Principle. It is, therefore, hailed that there is nothing outside the Absolute principle not aven Kaya, which in the system, is no longer i principle of inexplicability but is cons olousness as port ect Systentrya or freedom and one with. the absolute. As a result of this, the idealistio moniam of Kashmir is, more consistent than that of Sankara. The natur, or maya, ecoording to Bankara, in non-sentient or material. He holds the empirioul reality suohit (non conso ious) because it is the creation of maya, regarded as Jada. The ohief characteristio or the Valantie Brahman 18 its indetermination. All determinations are waye &ndash; mado or aupadhika. But maya the existence and the powe&rdquo; or maya ag Sakti in the salva Sóhool cannot be denied by the saints of Kashmir. It is well-expression mu powor or the absolute itself and is as real as the abæolute is. Ma. has imparted the status, aimilar to that or Parama Siva, to it (cr. Anadyanta Sivesani vyahira oa kathyate, M.A. I, 28). It is all-pervasive, transcendent and the</p>
<ol start="84">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>store housu or the world. The world which appears out of it is neither unreal nor material (acetana) as it is be lieved in Sankara&rsquo;s system. The universe, thus, 18 an expression or the Supreme Sakti whioh is conscious itselt and is one with the basic Reality.</p>
<p>. In other systems, the dyn ann 10 prinoiple 18 posited outside the Absolute directly or indirectly. In Sankara&rsquo;s system, it is maya, regarded as totally dirrerent from Brahman, and therefore it cannot touch the Reality as suob. It functions from without. Its existence or non existence does not affect the principle of the Ultimate Reality. In the idealistio moniam of the Buddhists the dynamic prinoiple consists of avidya (ignoranoo) and is more or less similar to that or 3ankara&rsquo;s Bohool. It d 18 appears on the origin or perfeot knowledge and persists so long as the kriowl sige has not appeared. It is also in consistent with the true knowledge. It flourishes in limbo or the o bacure baokground. It, as the gohool adnits, exists best not in association with the Reality. In short, according to the Vedanta and the Buddhism, the principle of a ynas 1sm is quite aloof from the Absolute.</p>
<p>8000</p>
<p>In the Kashmir Saivism, however, dynamism does not lose side of the Reality itsole in both, rest and motion. Contradictory aspects, statio and dynamiem, involved in human knowladge, have their place in the Reality itself. As Sakti, it is dynamism and as Siva ft</p>
<p>is statio. It is, at simultaneous embrace, both, motion less and motion. It is always itselr without action being a silent witness or the natura of pure conso iousness and yet it is always moving in the state of action. It acts in infinite ways. In the process or aotions, it is @volving itself into Lany forms and many grades. Besides,</p>
<p>Sen</p>
<p>it is a silent witness. It observes and controls all its aotivities. The moniem of the abeolute in the Kashmir School is so perfect that apperent contradictions between the static and the dynamigni do not hold a grounå to rely upon. This is the importance of freedom or 3vantantrya which is the natural deduotion of the metaphysical back ground of the Kanhi ir Śaiva system. In the Vaianta, the ground of the unity 18 jnana without acts which are ascribed to maya, regarded as juatorial and an element of the foreign agency. The sources of consoiousness and acts are different in the non-dual sohool of the Vedanta. But in the trika system, it is the same ground whioh in volves will as well as acts within itself. In other words, the Vedanta recognisas Siva as real but it is always free from Sakti. Bu the Trika believes in the same siva witn its essential nature, oalled Sakti. It is eternally oonjoined with it. In the Vedanta the self-luminous character of Brahman is eternal but not experienced. There is no special feature of the self-luminosity of the - Vedantio Brahmen. . But&rsquo; in the trika, the existence of the vimarśa (Sakti) is an essential property or the solr</p>
<p>luminous Siva.</p>
<p>The Prakasa or the suprome illumination</p>
<p>or the divine Being 18 1ts eternally solr-luminous</p>
<p>character and experienced at all times. Thus the self luminosity of Siva is more positive than that of Brahman.</p>
<p>Inspite of the importance or Sakti in the work one cannot oonolude that Śaiva philosophy of Kashmir is Siva-daya ita qualified by Sakti (Sakti visista). The . elaborato aluo idation of the concept &lsquo;Sakti&rsquo; available</p>
<p>in the various Salva literature of Kashmir is a more</p>
<p>Indication of the fact, how supreme Reality, Siva, being one fundamental unity, manifests itself ag various forms of Sakti in its oreative state. The author of Malini has</p>
<p>816,</p>
<p>styled it as &lsquo;Parama advsita&rsquo; (Ma. 18.4.) so that its read ers may not call it Jakt 1-V 1sista slvadvaita due to the varisd development or Sakti. The evolution or Sakti, stroese by the writers of 3aiva Philosophy should not be taken as a justification for designating this philosophy as &amp; Sive-dvaita qualiried by Sakti. Wo cannot deny the descent or the sakti as a principle. It existe as an agent of Siva in His Creative state. It also exists and appears as a Sakti in the least quantity, in the state or dogtruotion (Samhura-avastha). Thus we way should not for get the fact that the relation of Sakti to Siva oxigts only</p>
<p>in the two states, that 19, Sansara-avastha and Samhara avastha. But in the final resort when the individual spirits are liberated, Sakti fully merges with Siva from Śaiva ph 110sophers call Parama siva. It is a transcending state in whioh the absolute oneness of Siva predominates. Technically it is called &lsquo;unity of Siva and Sakti or Samarsya of Siva and Sakti.. It is a state or full mergence or Sakti with Siva and it points out the same oneness which we experience between the salt and water when the former molts into the latter and loses its separata individuality. It is the state where in the distinction or Siva and Sakti</p>
<p>and Sri Kantha, who are exponents of visistadvaita Vada school or qualified monism, we should not call this philo sophy visistadvaite.</p>
<p>Visistadvaita school of Ramanuja holds that in dividual selves and the objeots of the inanimato world are not mere appearances as the great Sankara states them. They are real and form the part of Brahman. They appear as body and attributes of Brahma. Apart from it, they have no separate individuality. The founder of the school</p>
<ol start="87">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>has admitted the unity of individual souls, inanimato phenomna end Frahman. According to him, the 1 united selves and the phenonnel objects are autordinate elements which have yigesya or attributed (predominating el groent),</p>
<p>Brahman. One of them cannot exist geparately. The complex whole (V 18 ista) which they included is conceived a3 unity. In this conneotion, we should note that Ramanuja has formulated a relation or inseparability betwson the attributed (vigesya) and the attributing (Visegana). The relation, inseparability or Aprthak Siddhi is imaginary. So far as attributing capao ity of individual selves and the phenomenal objects 1s concerned, we have no objection. They are subordinate elements and qualify the predominating elevent which is Brahman. We cannot deny the fundamental fact that the relation or the attributive and the attri buted is otornul. This relation ay continuo in the precos3 or manifestation but in the final state when &quot; individual selves are liberated, it has to cease. Aga matter of faot, both of them Visegana and Visosya will not continue in the state of liberation. Either or them will have to disappear. In that case, we will have no digtination or Vigoyana and Visegya. The qualifying element will fully merge with the qualified slowent. It</p>
<p>is the state of absolute oneness where in the sense of</p>
<p>duality disappears forevor.</p>
<p>Like Ramanuja who formulated the Visigtadvaita Vadu school in the moniatio philosophids or Madlasval</p>
<p>India, Sri Kantha also holds Visistadvaita Vada in Salvigna. He has rajooted the Dvaitadvaita sohool expounded by Bimborkasarya, on the basis that multiplicity and unity</p>
<p>being opposed to each other in nature, cannot co-axist on the gubatance. In conneotion with the bhed a bheda sohool, he holds that the difference between the ultimato Raality</p>

<p>It is believed that all 34 iva Atanas recognise siva or Perana 3iva as o suprerne Principle of perfect egoity. It is understood as a united whole or the two&rdquo; significant features, walled jnana and Kriya or prakusa and vimorsa. In a plain language, both of the aspects correspond to Slva and Sakti reapeotively, on which the philosophioal edir 100 of the Śaiva Sastras 13 baaad. They, though apparently seem distinct from eaoh other in their creative state, are interrelated and become one in the supreme state. It is an adulttad faot that one without the other cannot exist. Slva is understood as a symbol of consoiousness while Bakti uopeut is represen tative of dynaniam. Thay, both, in their natura, ara equal. To some extent, thay goom emphatia in their own position and are placed on equal footing. As we rind from the cloue study of the Salva Agamay, the status of Sakti principle, in most casss, is a bit higher than that ot give. This o bylous supremacy or Sukt i over siva ig due to the varied aotivities which are assigned to the former. As a result of this superiority of the Bakti, as we find, Sakta Sohool 1g originatai. As a matter or fact, Saive and sakta Schools are interrelated and general ly do not seem different in their fundamentals.</p>
<p>The Trika school or tho Kashmir gaivism is chiar</p>
<p>ly inrluonoad by the Śaiva Aganas and, therefore, it, in fact, represents the theory as well as the practice or the former in a new shape. The gohool or the Kaahir saiviam, as we study, chiefly follows the Agamio oult and philoso</p>
<ol start="90">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>-phical views of the Balvaguas, The School is absolutely non-dual and believes in the Supreme Unity of one Principle which evolves itselr into many forms through its own free will. Inspite of the fact that Supreme Prinoiple is Salva, the School does not fail to mention the importanco or Sakti, due to which, the former establishes its existence. Hence the place or Sakti in the Trika literature of Kashmir, is no less important than that in the Salvagamas. All the expounders of the Kashmir Saivism have paid tribute to the Sakti, to element and restored it to the rank or Siva. The nature of Sakti, to which all the funotionings of creation are assigned, is variously explained by the different exponents of the Sohool. In spite or so pro found and significance of this tattva, the trika thought 18 regarded as a Saive School and not a Sakta one. The obvious reason is that the founders or the school have not mentioned it as a separate principle. It is regarded as</p>
<p>an essential nature of the Absolute. For the justirioation or their statements, they have pointed out the various relation of Sakti, such as, Sanavaya, tadatmya, abheda, etc., to Siva. In short, Sakti exists but not apart from the Supreme Reality.</p>
<p>The position or the sakti principle in the Malini Sohool, whion, in many respeots, is understood as an essence of the Trika system, absolutely differs from that in the latter. The prino iple or Sakti has got a prominent place in the Sohool. Though it is an innost nature of the Supreme Reality, but it 18 regarded as all</p>
<p>in all.</p>
<p>The work, as the very name, Nalini vijayottara tantra, points out, is chiefly connected with the Malin&rsquo;i Sakti, which from the sakta point or view, rerers to the</p>
<ol start="91">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Para Sakti or Para Vak.</p>
<p>The gohools, related to the</p>
<p>tantrika culture, balieva that all phones, in their un</p>
<p>manifested form, remain latent in the Para Vak, supposed to be in a form of a garland. We admit that the Lalini School is monistio like the Trika School and recognises one Supreme Principle, Siva. It is also a fact that Sakti, apart from the essential nature or Siva, does not erist. The founder of the Sohool is aware of the taot that Siva or the statio naturo is, without Sakti, motion less and Sakti without the former is non-sentient. Their mutual support to each other is entirely needful. The Trika School stresses the interrelation of Siva and Sakti Both are equal in their nature and character. The view of the Ma. School about the 3 akti concept is a bit different form that of the trike system. The founder or the Sohool has gone a step higher. He is not satisfied with the mutual relation of siva and Sakti. To him, Sakti as a principle of action is mora favourable than sive as a statio prinoiple. He prefers Kriya to fnena.</p>
<p>He pays much tribute to Sakti and awards a very high</p>
<p>position to it. The various manifestations of Sakti enable us to form our opinion that the work, though monist1o, chiefly ropresenta Sakta charactor.</p>
<p>As soon as we read that Siva is explaining the</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>contents of Siddhayokisvari tantre, in which halini 18 also included, to his consort, Parvati, we see the author of the work, elaborately eluo id ing the term &ldquo;upadaya&rdquo;, which literally means &lsquo;acooptable&rsquo;.. He attaohes the greatest importanoe to the Supreme Prinoiple and wentions it as All-doing, all-pervading and trangendent. The point worth noting is that Sakti does not lovu hiu sight. It has also got Siva&rsquo;s primary position (or. Sakalo niskalo nantah Sakti rapyasya tadvidha, Ma. I, 18). By this first</p>
<ol start="92">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>nention of Sakti with 3iva, we can rorm an idea that both, Siva and Sakti, have equal importanco. Later on, it appears as a desire of siva (nijoooha) and become a tool by which the Lord Isnicest Hindelr es many. This pr 12 ciple, in its inotruinentalises state, 15 torud us ways (ot. jagad utpadayanesa maya-Mavisya saktibhih, ma. I 25).</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;paya&rsquo; nay not confusa readers, I wish</p>
<p>to make it olear. Tha meya of Sankara&rsquo;s syatea is not accepted in this school. The place or that maya is taken by Sakti which is absolutely different from the torner. The fundamental distinction betwesa the two is that the maya or &lsquo;Sankara&rsquo; School is non-sentient and therefore it has no relation consoious Brehman. But the Sakti or the Śaiva School is conscious naturo of Siva and it 10 nover dirferent from hin. The word, maya in the verse, mention ed above, is used in twofold sense. Firstly it is unior stood as.Sukti, non-distinot from Siva. Secondly, it is not that maya or which Sankara is swaro. It is tattva rupa maya from which Kela eto., tattvas are originated.</p>
<p>This Sakti, even in its manifestation as maya, continues to taka pra-erdinent position and the author has regarded it as beginningless, endless and all-pervading (ua. I, 28). A most important quality, attributed to it, 18</p>
<p>Jagato nidaih&rdquo; which literally means a atore house or the phenomenal universe. This epithet, used to show tho signirioano. of Sakti, also points out a bhasayada. We read from the text that out of this maya, those appear other prinoiples, such as, Xala, meu. vidya eto.</p>
<p>In this conneotion, it is a noticeable point that the Supreme Reality, to whioh thiu sakti belongo, in thrown into a hollow back ground and its profound position ag</p>
<p>baon awarded to Sakti.</p>
<p>The opithets, such as, siva,</p>
<ol start="93">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Igani and Eka&rsquo; refer to the signirioant position or this prinoiple. Inspite of its absolute onuness, which is</p>
<p>denoted by the terza &ldquo;k&rdquo; it bud om au many and Quusds tho</p>
<p>outegorical universu (cr. Asuta sa kala tattva 19. yad yogada bhavat puman, ma. I 27). Tha Ultimate Reality or the system has become a mere abstract idea or a pura exporience and it has been replaced, as the text says, by Sakti, which has been gradually brought to the forefront.</p>
<p>INOM</p>
<p>In connection with the utmost importance of Sakti, an add uoeable point is that the school layo much stress on the maya from which various categories spring up, though the process of oreation, viz., Siva, Sakti, Sedasiva etc., mentioned in the trika literature, is also agrseable to the School of Malini.</p>
<p>In the foregoing paragraphs, I have pointed the twofold development of the Supreme will of siva a Sukis and maya. We must note now the third manifestation or this Sakti. This evolution or Sakti is tripartite, isoha, jnana and Kriya. The author, nentioning the proper nature of these Sakt is, has regarded this will as a oraation or the whole universo (jugaddhati1). The term undoubtedly, refers to the origin of natter and letters. In conneation with the oreation of various phonga, tho tounder or ths Wa. School has mentioned this Sakti as Mutrka and Walini, The further evolution of the Matrka into rirty lottore, called Saktis, is another remarkable point that refers to the significance of salti.</p>
<p>In adaition to the manifestation or Sakti, un entioned above, there is another further tripartito development of Sakti, viz., Para, Parapara and Apara. This olassirioation is absolutuly based on the functions of Sakti. Ao we losrn from the text that the &ldquo;Sakti of</p>
<p>Siva is endless. It is due to its functions that it is olassified under three heads. The name &lsquo;para&rsquo; stands for those benign Saktis which are Supreme like Siva and lead worldly creatures to the supreme status (of. Sivadhama phlapradah Ma. III, 33). By MParapara&rdquo;, we mean those Saltis which bear the progress or the limited selves (anus) towards the final goal by bringing about their attachment to the mixed fruits of their actions (Ma. III, 32). Last ly the &lsquo;Apara&rsquo; is styled as &lsquo;Ghorataie&rsquo; and it implies those Saktis which closely embrace the individual souls and draw them more and more downward by attaching them to the objeots of the senses (Ma. III, 31).</p>
<p>From the direct or indirect references to Saktis</p>
<p>in this book, it is not difficult for a reader to conolude the high position which this concept has got throughout the whole school of Malini. For example, let us examine</p>
<p>the importance the exponent of the school has imparted to</p>
<p>thig Sakti,</p>
<p>At the very outset the word, &ldquo;maric1&rdquo; implies Sakti which is regarded as related to the moon of wisdom (oon soious Siva) in the benedictory vorge of this work. It is mentioned here as dominating the whole universe like the rays of the moon.</p>
<p>Let us adduoe another instance which also con fers that the main character of the work is Sakta (rolated to gekti). It is Sakti that inspires the sages, Narada, Agastya, eto. for the study of Siva-Yoga and consequently they go to Kartikeya (Ma. I. 3).</p>
<p>By a olose study of the contents or the work, wa oan form our opinion that the work breathes out the sakta</p>
<p>spirit and represents a Sakta Vedanta.</p>
<p>As soon as Karti</p>
<p>-keya begins to relate the Yoga, heard from 3iva ani ! Parvati, to the gapos, we find that the Goddess tha, the divine consort of siva, is plaod on an equal footing with her Lord. Later on this equal position of Sakti becomes prominent. The suprome Principle, Siva, retires and his essent al nature oorog to the forefront with all the attri butes or her Lord. Wo see that Siva becomes a principle of pure experience and his Sakti reigns suprane over all the processes of the cosmic evolution,</p>
<p>From the prominent position, awarded to Sakti, we can say that the founder of the Ma. Sohool has correotly estimated this principle and rogarded it as a world energy. : Its devotees are asked to concentrate themselves on it in the form of a woman. The worship of the womanly aspeot of God cannot be ignored as a vague idea of the Indian mind. The female character or God is highly respected by the Indiang. It is connected with the Sakta School or philosophy.</p>
<p>It is an admiftod fact that the condopt &ldquo;Sakti&rdquo;</p>
<p>occupies very important place rather uniquo ite oharactor in the history of the tantrika philosophy. Even the Śaiva systems, which hold 31va as a Supreme Prino ipla, have not failed to recognise the importance of Sakti. It 19 believed that even Siva as suoh, without any reference to Sakti, is as good as non-existent. This means éven the state of existenie to be apprehended, as such implies the functions or Sakti without which we can not say that a thing is or that it is not. Even puro Boing to be realised ag pure being presupposes Sakti. Hence not merely ror the dynamic purpose but for the very existence of a thing, Sakti is highly noodful. Without Sakti, so it arrirod, being ax or non-being, light or derkness, manifestation or</p>
<p>non-manifestation has absolutely no tomaniacs. This specifio value or sukti l&rsquo;opresont 3 its waique oharaotar.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the system or Bankuta, es usually understood, has its attitudo toward Erakaan as free from every form of Sakti. It says that puro exis tence or awareness or golr-bliss constituta tho vary nature of Brahman whioh ie solr-luminous. The advooates of Sakti analyse the concept of Bi&rsquo;ahman and find even here Sukti is already implied. No doubt, it is cit sakti and It is this which accounts for the soir-lwinous nature of the Fare Bralman. In this conngotion, I may be allowed</p>
<p>to put down the remarkablo verso or Bhartr Hari, a great Granarien and philosophor of his times, whor ain tha in</p>
<p>portance or sukti is clarified. (cr. Vasrupata codutloanek ava bod hasya sa svati. Na prakasah prakagata sa hi pratyaya marsoni). This shows that even solr-luminosity (Svayam prakasatva) or Braliman implies the sll ont action or Sakti which is ong with it.</p>
<p>One thing renains to be pointed out in conneotion with the Sakta spirit of the work. It is already pointed out that the tantrika Sadhana ror solr-realisation is ologe</p>
<p>ly associated with the letters of two kinds, regarded as representatives or Siva and Sakti. Tha Ma. Sohool also follows this method or varna 3adhana very strictly in its owa remarkable way. It has ouus inglad vowels and aonso nants and named it as &ldquo;nad iphanta&rdquo; order. It indicates that the subordinate position or the consonants rosogaised by the Matrka School is not agreeable to the 1a. gyetem Congonants, as Grammarians also hold, are developed forms or vowel, but this school does not take thew in that light. It stresses that both, vovels and consonants, ex oplote (purna) in their nature and do not require mutual support</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>to exist.</p>
<p>The author of T.A. also mentions that comingling of vowels and consonants inplias the equul position of Sive and Sakti (T.A. 15th., 133). The conuncntutor or T.A, hag olarified the idea that though the nad i phanta order</p>
<p>breathes out the spirit or equality betwen siva und</p>
<p>Sakti, but the character of the la. School is chiefly related to Sakti (of. Kintoo walinyangaktaaya ovubhavasya udreko yenoktum-parmarthatab S&amp; sakti tanuh, T.A. 15th. A. Comm.).</p>
<p>From T.A., it is uigo learned that there were other alphabet loal orders at vogue among the 3 a iva pecto as kulaputtalike tantra mentions but the Nad 1 phanta order was muoh used. Hence this order was adoptes by the la.</p>
<p>sohool.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tho work, in its nature, is relazio-philosophical and due to thig character, it is distinguishod from the</p>
<p>triple thought. As ter as the question or do guatios is concarnud, both, the Ma. ani thu Trika Soho024 rayu ble euoh. Both admit ona Suprexua Prinoiplo, siva, una repra sent idealistio monimn. The pouition or sakti principio 18 not as primary in the Trika Sohool as it is in the Ma. system. Due to the domination or sakti to rozari tha Sohool aa sakta is, by no means, improper. The most distinguishing faatura that separate it from the triune</p>
<p>system is its religious oulmination. The spooirio atti tude of the work is towards the praotloal Yoga. The work lays much emphasis on intuition. No@piritual wealor 18 transformed to the status of Divinity unlogg hiv intuitivo faculty is awakened by various tantrika ritua. Tho dootrine of the seven dharanad is an instanow or tho Taot. It teaches Sadhakas, how to idontify themselves with the</p>

</ol>
<p>supreme. First they ought to identify thoma elvag with the gross elements from which they start their sudhana. After transcending theao lowor lovels they should identiry themselves with the Inrinito. The montion of various dharanas is a proor or this eralual acont the work favours. Due to this religious forvour of the work, Abhinava Gupta hag regarded it as an authority and authentioity on the Trika (or. trikasaran malinimatain, T.A.).</p>
<p>In religio-philosophical literature or the Agenio oulture, Malini vijayottara tantra occupies a very important place. Being arfiliated to the Salvagamas or Kaa hinir, it inherits all the wealth and grand aur of the Śaiva mate physics and descipline. But in certain respecto, it geems to go beyond the recognised concepts of the Trika. There is no doubt that the Sohool was very anoiont and its</p>

Even in the age or Abhinava Gupta, who was one or the best exponents of the School, the line or the teaching or this school was already on decline.

<p>FIRST ADHIKARA.</p>
<p>SUMMARY.</p>
<p>In the benedictory verse, the author has rerarred to the importanou of the universal congoiousness (01t Sakti) which prova 11. everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The author has brought Kartikeya, the son of Mahe vara and Uma, on the scene to relate the Siva-Yoga to the sagos, Narada oto., who approach him to learn tho</p>
<p>game.</p>
<p>He begins to tell them the story of Sankara Yoga as he has learnt it from Siva, whon ha was relating the same to Parvati. She, keeping in view the well being or ran kind, requested Maheevara to relate the there or siddh&rsquo;a Yogisvari Tantra in its abbreviated for as the same in detail cannot be grasped by men or low intelligenoa.</p>
<p>Sankar has mentioned the portion or th: Siddha Yogisvari Tantra, the name of which 18 Walini vijayotra Tantra and which He has got from Aghora (Anabhya Siva). The work mentions two olasses or the phenomenal objects. The first group, which contains Siva, Sakti, Mantra, Mantresvara, Mantramehesvara and Vijnanakala, is accept able. The name of the other group is avoidable, which inoludes the thro, impurities, viz., anava Mala, tho Karna Mala and Maya Mala. The two kupects, viz., imenoutal</p>

</ol>
<p>(Sakala) and transcendental. (Niskala) or ultimate Reality (3 iva) aro mentioned. Similarly Sakti, whion is not dirferent from him, has also two aspouts, dynamic (uutivo) and static Siva, desiring to oreate the world, first of all, greated eight kinds or vijnanakala (Pudsals) and awakened them to rise to the status of the Vantra, Mantre vara and mantramahusvara.</p>
<p>The laportance of the independent Will of tho</p>
<p>Lord (9iva), whio, oroates the universe by 1t, 13 mentioned..</p>
<p>The rirat limiting adjunot, which brings I iritation to hin, 18 his own free will, called Maya.</p>
<p>The Maya Tattva oroatos Kala fron whioh the Asuddha Vidya is mainirested. Similarly the creation of the other tattvas. 18 pointed out. The three taints, !</p>
<p>strengthen the animal state of Siva and bring 1. imitation</p>
<p>to His qualities, guoh as, all-knowarship eto.</p>
<p>The Lord has created three and a hal sroras or</p>
<p>Mantras, which liberated the Anus and went back to eter nity. Thus in course of time, the Anu,, when it is consi</p>
<p>dered as capable of Katting liberation, is unified with</p>
<p>the divine power. In this philosophy, lovation or fall of the individualgelr (Anu) 10 dependent on the Sakti. When the salvation of the limitodaclr is, intended, this Sakti in unified with the Anu and it is divide into thras</p>
<p>classes.</p>
<p>The unirloation with the Sakti in ltg acuto form cannot be realised by the aspirant in his physical boing. After getting this Sakti-Pata, tho Sadhaka aies at ongo and bacones 31va. The second Lind is reallued in thio body. The Sadhaka enjoys tho World and after death attaina Siva-3tate. In the third kind, tho aspirant is</p>
<p>inspired and encouraged to go to</p>
<p>toucher in order to</p>
<p>1 earn Siva-Yoca.</p>
<p>Eraphesis is laid on the Curu for the spiritual riso. The entire satisfaction of the Quru is highly 69sential for tha Sadhaka, who is said to be or four kinds, Samayi, Sedhaka, Putraka and Acarya along the four kinds of initiation. The Sivayoga cannot be completo unless one learns to distinguish betwoon the mooaptable and avoidable</p>

<p>SECOND ADHIKARA</p>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<ol start="3">

</ol>
<p>dharapa, by which a Sadhaka can oross tho oocan or the</p>
<p>various principles to attain the supreme Reality.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>names or these &lsquo;dharanas are as followi</p>

<li>
<p>Nava Vidhi. 5. Suptavidhi. 8. Panoavidhi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trividhi.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Panoad asa vidhi is applied to the Tuttvad, beginning from the earth to Prakrti Tattva. Siva in His activa State 18 different from Sakti. Again Siya who 13</p>
<p>the chief pramatr assumes seven grades termed &lsquo;Saptu Pramati</p>
<p>Bhunikas! in His wordly state (Sansari-dasa).</p>
<p>The nanos</p>
<p>of these soven measurers in descendius order ars as kun</p>

</ul>
<p>Siva 1s not without nia Sakti.. Therefors thosa</p>
<p>geven Pranatrs have also their sovun Saktis.</p>
<p>Thus the whole number is fourtean. The foru or the thing on whion th. Pramatr Med itatos is called &lsquo;Svarupa&rsquo;. This Svarupa in the Panoadasa Vidhi, in the case of the earth, is dulln688 (gadatvadi). The whole number 19 fifteen, 1.6., ono objeot of the meditation (Svarupa or Sakalantara) and seven Pramatrs with their soven Saktis.</p>
<p>This is the lowest dharana, from whioh a Sadhaka has to start. After completing this cours of the lowost dharana and getting mastery over the olass of the twentytour categories, a Sadhaka enters into a bit higher teat, ballad *Trayodasa Vidhi&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In this higher dharana, Sakala Pruwatr with his Sakti becomes an object of meditation (Svarupa) and tho remaining gir pramutrs with their sakt18 nad itato. This method is applied to the six categories, 1.0., from Purusa to Kala (one Purusa Tattva and rive its aspects - kala, Raga, eto.). &ldquo;This group, though inferior, is a bit super ior to that already mentioned. The next stop, whion an aspirant has to take, is elovenrola (Eladasvidhi) wethod which is applied to the Pralaya Kavali Praratrs as well as to the Maya-Tattva, both of which are superior to tho aforo said tattvas.</p>
<p>The ninafold othod (Nava viali) 15 suquired for the vijnanakala Pramatrs who aro superior to tlu Pralaya kalau and who stand betwoon the Waya Tattva and Sudha.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>promat</p>
<p>Vidhya (Mayordhve Suddhavidyadhah, T.A.). In thig dharana, the object or meditation is Vignanakala with his Sakti on which the four pramatrs, from Mantra to Siva with their four Saktis, meditate. In this Dharana Vijnanakala with his Sakti is an objeot of meditation and the other four Pramatrs beginning from Mantra to Siva with their respect</p>
<p>lva Saktis, are med itators.</p>
<p>Nert dharana is Sapta Vidhi (sevenfold method) in which Mantra Pramatr with his Sakti is held an object with the other three measurers along their faktis. Tho Mantra Pranata is far superior to the measurers already mentioned as it has only one taint in the stata or baing destroyed.</p>
<p>In the fivefold dharana, Mantrosvara is a form of</p>
<p>an object (Svarupa) and the other two measurers with their gaktis are med 1tators who conoantrate on the objeot.</p>
<p>Next to this dharana is the threefold method (trividhi) which has, from the Trika po int of view, con tains the significance of the triple Mantramaheevara Pramatr with hia Sakti as an object on which Siva with His Sakti</p>
<p>moditates.</p>
<p>The whole system mentioned in these seven dharanas ahows how an aspirant can rise from a grozd Stata to the supreme reality. The Trika dootrine does not dony tho objects of the world. Its chier mark is this that as gross objects are evolved from the subtlo prinoiplo vo an approach should be made to the subtle through the gross.</p>
<p>The method of the seven weditations can be applied to the number of the one hundred and the eighteen worlds</p>
<p>also.</p>
<p>The Sadhaka practising thesa dharanak, soust inos</p>
<p>la uniried with tho Sakti or Siva. The ran unified with the Bakti has perfoot devotion to Siva, success in the Mantras, control over tho ardaturty of the world and the accomplishment or his task. This Rudru-Jakti Sanavese 19 olags1ried into five divisionu, 1.., Phuta, Tattva, Atma, Mantra and 3 akti which again ure divided into riv®, thirty, three, ton and two kindg respaotively. The whole number of these Sanavojas is tirty.</p>
<p>A great orphasis is laid on the three Sanavesas,</p>
<p>viz. anava, Sakta and Sambhava, whion have their speoial</p>
<p>signirioance in the plans of the spiritualisation or Sadhaka. The anava mentions physioal approach to tho fundamental Reality and inolud as all the means or tha Yoga method. In this Samavogs, the idea of duality prodca inates and a Sadhaka reaches his destination through duality. The Sakta Samavosa refers to &amp; Sadhake or bheda bliada olags : realises the subjectivo units temporarily. He is not mentally balonood. Sakta is ohiorly related to the two fold effort, physical and mental. The third, Samavoua, Sambhava is, free rrom all the physical us well as mental efforts. In this state everything of the world seems consciousness. The whole univorse is full of siva (Siva maya). The cause or this arekening is a preceptor, who plays a very important part in the spiritual #phero&rsquo; or Sa ivism. It should not be thought that the various Samavesas yield various fruits. They are dirferent means for self-realisation. I</p>

The Kashmirian mantravAdin abhinavagupta praising the bhairavI of trika

> ...

Here abhinavagupta is more explicit in stating that yoginI being invoked is parA worshipped in the trIshUlAbja-maNDala of the pUrvAMnAya.

It is always a pleasure to study the great Kashmirian master abhinavagupta: his language has beauty&full of tAntrika technicality. Here his ma~NgalAcharaNam praises the yAmala of the bhairava& the bhairavI while also giving his, mother's& father's name in double entendre.

The kaula tradition repeatedly refers to the bhairava as bharita-tanu: why is it understood as the universe filling his body. The principle of origination as the tradition is explained thus by abhinavagupta:

> ... 


That reflective power of the bhairava is understood as basis of creation and is the bhairavI parA of the pUrvAMnAya tradition that abhinavagupta followed. Technically his preferred system also incorporated uttarAMnAya [kAlI-kula] elements like the goddess kAlasaMkarShanI.

In this snippet abhinava salutes his predecessors in the pUrvAMnAya, i.e. trika tradition that he calls traiyambaka. This connection with tryambaka rudra is an old one the name reflects rudra's connection with the three goddesses. These appear as parA, parAparA and aparA on the 3 prongs of the trident in the trIshUlAbja-maNDala of trika. 

His use of the term the "pearls from tAmraparNI" to praise these ancient teachers is notable. We hold that it is not merely to compare them to the luster of pears from shrIlankA but to indicate their origin in the south. This goes with the fact there was once a lineage of successors of abhinavagupta in south India and also the presence of a trika tradition there before him from chidambaram in the drAviDa country.

## konkan
Second, abhinavagupta himself trace his lineage to south India. Hence, we cannot conclusively say that the pUrvAMnAya originated in Kashmir. It was just one of the seats of the tradition. In fact kaula tradition internally points to a root in the Konkans.

That is not to say that was the ultimate source because there other root places mentioned like oDDiyAna in the Northwest. 

Finally as I pointed before western India with focality on kAyAvarohaNa in Gujarat was central to the development of the pre-Agamika shaiva traditions.

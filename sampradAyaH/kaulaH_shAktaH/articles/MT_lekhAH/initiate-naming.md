> 'Bodhi, Prabhu, Yogī, Ananda, Pāda and Avali - one should form the name of the Heroes (i.e. the Kaula adepts) and their wives (by adding) these (the names of their lineages) at the end."963 Thus, for example, (we find the names) Satyabodhi, Viśvaprabhu and so on.

For the kaula-s gotra-s there is again little evidence for diversity: madhurAja-yogin; abhinavagupta-pAda; shivabodhi, chandrabodhi. I might have seen an Avali in a pashchimAmnAya text, but don’t recall offhand.

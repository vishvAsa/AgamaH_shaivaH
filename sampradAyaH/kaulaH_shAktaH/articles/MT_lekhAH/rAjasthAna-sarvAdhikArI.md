My friend met a kaula mantravAdin in Rajasthan who is said to be a sarvAdhikArin who has undergone kramadIkSha. Hence, he practices a vidhi with 5 AmnAya-s. The usual 4 directional ones, but he has one on top of them, termed the anuttarAmnAya. That is based on an elevation of the dakShiNamnAya. 

What is remarkable is that in place of the ShoDaShI shrIkula mantra used by several other practitioners, he uses a mantra from the yoginI-jAla-saMvara. His practice also has an expanded uttarAmnAya centered on an expanded guhyakAlI practice.

Additionally, he has slotted among these various other mantra-s. 

Of note was his practice of an 18-handed tvaritA, where she is worshipped with a parivAra of 9 dUti-s: 1. indradUtikA; 2. jvAlinI; 3. shabarIl 4. karAlI; 5.plava~NgadUtI; 6. vegikA; 7. kapiladUtikA; 8. raudradUtikA; 9.brahmadUtikA.

and 18 yoginI-s:

1. nalA; 2. brahmatuNDa; 3. khagA; 4. khecharI; 5. jvAlinI; 6. shavabhIShaNA; 7. chaNDA; 8. ChedanI; 9. karAlI; 10. kharahA~NgI; 11. vakShA; 12. kapilA; 13. tejovatI; 14. raudrI; 15. mAtR^I; 16.varI; 17. ghorA; 18. brahmavetAlI

He begins his practice with a relatively simple worship of bhairava with the mantra: 

> OM bhAM bhairava bhairava bhayaMkara mAM rakSha rakSha huM phaT || 

followed by the invocation of/ offering of bali to the ogdoad of directional deities and the driving of 9 stakes into the ground for the bhairava and the 8 deities. This is followed by worship of 16 gaNa-s, the 8 mAtR^ikA-s, and the 8 bhairava-s.

While the knowledge of the YJS text is limited to its mantra in lieu of the later shrIvidyA-s is deployed by some kaula practitioners. 

While the said kaulAchArya is v1 from Rajasthan, his lineage seems to have had connections to Nepal via the ex-royal houses.

The shArdUlavikrIDita dhyAna of the bhairavI as per the mAtR^isadbhAva tantra of the brahmayAmala tradition preserved in South India. 

The chera magician shaMkaran nambUtiri indicates that it might be used for rurujit, widely worshiped in the chera country. Followers of his paramparA also teach that shubhaMkArikA is a euphemism for the asura's head held by the bhairavI in one of her arms. In this form, she may be worshipped as the mistress of the four pITha-s --  o-jA-pU-kA -- that are prominent in the kulAmnAya-s.

> सद्यः सङ्कर-संगतासुर-शिरः-श्रेणीभिर् आस्रोल्बणैर् ।  
> **आबध्य** स्रजम् उत्तरीयम् अनया **संबिभ्रतीं** सादरम् ॥  
> दोर्भिः खेट-कपाल-पन्नग-महाघण्टा--शुभं-कारिका--  खट्वाङ्ग-त्रिशिखान् असिं च दधतीं वन्दे महाभैरवीम् ॥ 
> 
> ओ-जा-पू-का भैरव्यै नमः ॥ 

She with the freshly [severed] rows of heads, with bloody skins, of the Asura-s arriving to the battle ties a garland and carefully wears it as an upper garment,  
who holds in her (eight) hands a shield, a skull, a snake, a great bell, the "auspiciousness-bestower"*,  
a skull-topped staff, a trident and a sword, I worship that great Bhairavī.

*śubhamkārikā is said to represent the head of an Asura.

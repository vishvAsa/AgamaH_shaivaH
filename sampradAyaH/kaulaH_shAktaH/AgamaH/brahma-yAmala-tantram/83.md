<details><summary>मानसतरङ्गिणीकृत् - टिप्पनी</summary>

The lacunose & somewhat corrupt paTala 83 of the Ur-brahmayAmala preserves a shaiva origin mythology as the action of kapAlIsha-bhairava, the primary deity of the system. It posits the pIlupAka hypothesis with shiva's sweat as atomic bonds for the origin of the universe.
</details>


परमाणु-समूहन्तु  
पार्थिवं तद् असंगतम् ।  
योगेन स्वेदम् उत्पाद्य  
संगृहीतं वरानने ॥ 

<details><summary>मानसतरङ्गिणीकृत्</summary>

The mass of atoms of the parthiva element did not bond together. Having generated sweat by yoga [I] had them bonded together, O pretty-faced one. 
</details>



कृत्वा करतले तं तु  
मथितं शक्ति-योजनात् ।  
अत्य् उष्णतां समायातं  
दृशा तच् च निरीक्षणे ॥ 

<details><summary>मानसतरङ्गिणीकृत्</summary>

Having made this [bonded mass] in my palm, I then churned it with Śakti (c.f. Manthana-bhairava: the churning Bhairava). By my looking at it, it became extremely hot brought together with my gaze. 
</details>


तत् तेजसा विपक्वं हि  
कठिनं काञ्चनामयम् ।  
विभाति कर-मध्यस्थं  
भानु-कोटि-समप्रभम् ॥ 

<details><summary>मानसतरङ्गिणीकृत्</summary>

Indeed, by that energy it was “cooked” and became a dense golden [mass]. It blazed forth in the midst of my palm with the light of a crore suns. 
</details>


त्रिगुणं त्रितयाधारं  
लोकपाल-निकेतनम् ।  
चतुर्दश-कुलावासं  
तन् निधिर् भोग-मोक्षयोः ॥

<details><summary>मानसतरङ्गिणीकृत्</summary>

With the three guna-s as its triple foundation [it became] the abode of the world-guardian deities. [It became] the abode of the 14 families [of beings], the receptacle of their experience and liberation. 
</details>



तत्रान्ते सत्त्व-जन्मा वै  
ब्रह्मा क्षिप्तो गुरुत्वया+++(=??-)+++ ।  
वृत्ये [सृष्टौ??] तु प्राक्-कृतः सो वै  
बुध्दौ व्यक्तिगतस् तु यः ॥  

<details><summary>मानसतरङ्गिणीकृत्</summary>

Verily, Brahman, born of sattva, fell into that mass through gravity. In the enclosure [in genesis?] he is verily the first to be made, [appearing] in intelligence and who is individuality. 
</details>



प्रजानां कारणं सो वै  
विवेकान् संप्रकाशकः ।  
द्वितीयो ऽपि ततो देवि  
तमसा सत्त्व-योजनात् ॥ 

<details><summary>मानसतरङ्गिणीकृत्</summary>

He is verily the cause of beings, and the manifester of discernments (i.e., agency). Then, O goddess, through the union of sattva and tamas, a second [emerged]. 
</details>


उभाभ्यां तु रजोमूर्तिः  
निर्मितः कारणेच्छया ।  
सो ऽधिपालन-योगाय  
तद् अण्डे संनिवेशितः ॥ 

<details><summary>मानसतरङ्गिणीकृत्</summary>

[he emerged] from both as the embodiment of rajas (Viṣņu), generated by intent of the primal cause. For carrying out preservation, he entered into that [world]-egg. 
</details>


स्व-स्वभावस्थितौ तौ तु  
कर्तृत्वे तमसा हितौ ।  
प्रेरितौ तु मया देवि  
तमसा सृष्टि हेतुना ॥

<details><summary>मानसतरङ्गिणीकृत्</summary>

Each as per their own nature [became] demiurges incited by tamas. They were impelled, O goddess, by me, via tamas for the sake of creation.

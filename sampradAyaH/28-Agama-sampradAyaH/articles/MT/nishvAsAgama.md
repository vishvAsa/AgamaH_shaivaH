title = "NishvAsAgama"
+++

Occidental Indologists consider the nishvAsa collection as the oldest of the surviving shaivAgama-s, i.e., [tantra-s of the shaiva-mantra-mArga](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/03/26/the-primary-tantras-of-rudra/). The lists giving the primary canon of the shaivAgama list nishvAsa as one of the 28 tantra-s of the Urdhvasrotas. The nishvAsa itself records that there were 28 tantra-s of the Urdhvasrotas of which it is one. 

## Etymology
But the rationale behind the name nishvAsa is rather puzzling. It gives the below auto-rationalization:

> अनधीत्यथ निश्वासं निश्वसन्ति पुनः पुनः । अधीत्वा चैव निश्वासन् न पुनर् निश्वसन्ति ते ॥  
निश्वास एव विख्यातस् सर्व-तन्त्र-समुच्चयः । यं ज्ञात्वा मुच्यते जन्तुः संसार-भव-बन्धनात् ॥ 
>
> Those who have not studied the Niśvāsa keep sighing (in distress) again and again. But having studied the Niśvāsa, those who sigh do not sigh again. The Niśvāsa is verily renowned as the compendium of all tantras, knowing which, a being is liberated from the bondage of samsara and worldly existence.


It is possible that this was a secondary "etymology" and the original logic was different.

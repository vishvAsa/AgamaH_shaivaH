## Dealing with denialism
There are two ways of combating denialism:

1. Tether one’s understanding of “truth” exclusively to “occurrence in historical time” like what Abrahmas do & thereby try to prove that every verse of every story occurred exactly as written — i.e. the “Time Machine test” — if you go back in time, you will see the events unfold exactly as written. That way, you are not denying history but instead sincerely asserting that scriptural accounts conform to history, down to the last letter. Good luck.

2. Expand one’s understanding of “truth”. This is good because it cuts off our Śraddhā from the aśuddhatattva Kāla.

## In buddhi-tattva
One can fully believe in events based on Paurāṇika timescales without having to extend that into historical time as we know.

The validity & truthfulness of the Rāmāyaṇa, Rāmopāsana, Rāma-mantra-sādhana & Rāmānugraha are completely independent of whether the events as described in the Rāmāyaṇa had occurred in historical time, exactly as versified.

Interestingly, in Āgama sources, as I just recalled after writing this tweet 👇🏾, the 4 yugas are seen as characteristics of the Buddhi. Can we make something of this? 

One may advance a view that the yuga-based narratives in Itihāsapurāṇas are those of events which have occurred in non-physical Buddhitattva in a non-physical way, with some similarities to events as they have physically transpired on earth in what we call, “historical time”.

This may also explain why we can have contradictory accounts of key Itihāsa events & yet hold them all to be simultaneously true & divine accounts. It is because events in the Buddhi, unlike earth, is not limited to a single “stage of action” at any one point in time. What I mean is that on earth, at a particular place, at a specific point of time (the stage), only one version of an event could have physically happened. But this is not the case with the Buddhitattva, which possesses the capacity for infinite such “stages”.

## kalpa-bheda
Additionally, the often “hackneyed” explanation of kalpabheda for such contradictory accounts could be made more interesting by being made to cohere with the idea of yugas (& Kalpas?) being functions of Buddhitattva.

A Saiddhāntika Theology of History if you would have it ☝🏾 

Believing in the two-level interpretation of Itihāsapurāṇas is the way to go. A way to understand how the “Rāmāyaṇa of faith” (as stated in this post below) works can be seen here 👉🏾https://x.com/ghorangirasa/status/1627872771282980864?s=46

A key idea in Śaivāgama is that Yugas are functions of the Buddhi/Mahat-tattva. This leads us to infer that the earth & the worlds of Devas, Asuras, etc all exist within the Buddhi-Tattva.

Even if millions of years ago,  there may not have been any humans on “this” earth we are living on right now, the literal versions of the stories of the Itihāsapurāṇas, replete with all kinds of Astras, wars between Devas, Asuras & humans & all other supernatural features have indeed occurred in the earth & other realms existing in the Buddhitattva.

## Historic tethering
Dharmaśāstra, adherence to scriptures, etc are not “Abrahamic”. What is most definitely Abrahamic, however, is the blind tethering of “truthfulness & validity of a darśana/sādhana/muktimārga” to “occurrence within historical time”. 

Such tethering is tantamount to conceit as it is basically telling Īśvara that we accept Him or His path or His revelations **only** because they occurred in linear historical time (i.e. if we go back in time using a Time Machine, we will see things unfold on “this” physical earth exactly as versified in the itihāsapurāṇa). 

Inasmuch that conceit is an insult to the majesty & sovereignty of Īśvara, who has created a plethora of subtle worlds & yet subtler timescales & informed us of them in His scriptures & who has fixed certain physical laws for “this” earth, a blind traditionalist, who has memorized 10,000 verses of the Śruti & fails to exercise his intellect creatively to understand the scriptures, is guilty of such conceit.

## Historical data well used

Going by the exchange on our TL last night, it’s clear why we need to be data-driven when it comes to questions of historical occurrence (things as they actually happened in time). Theology, metaphysics, soteriology, ontology, etc are the proper domain of scriptures & traditions. But we need to avail ourselves of the full range of sophisticated tools when it comes to historical facts & not short-change ourselves. This is particularly so when the game is rigged & will remain so for a long time, against Hindus in general & Brāhmaṇas in a narrower (but still important) range of discussions. 

If we take the position that we should blindly accept traditional narratives on historical events (however unsubstantiated they are), it only legitimizes others coming up with “traditional accounts” of their own.

Śaiva-Siddhānta was pan-Bhāratīya, its earliest Ācāryas & works were all in Kāśmīram & Madhyapradeśa. This is what objective reading of sources has given us. And it destroys the bullshit narrative created by Dravidianist “Śaivas” regarding the origin of Siddhānta. But because nobody takes rigour or truth seriously in order to prepare a good case, we have to now put up with concocted “tradition & memory” whose accounts of what happened must be true only in a parallel universe. 

Same thing goes with Gotras. It is obvious that the Gotrapravara system is Vaidika/Ārya in origin & the use of “gotra” outside this context is inspired by the Vaidika one. But we now have people making ridiculous claims such as that their super-specific sub-sub-sub-jāti’s “gotra” system is older than the Pan-Bhāratīya Gotrapravara system, codified in texts. 

Making it a battle of two alternative traditions is pointless as if both are traditions, third parties will just accept the bullshit “traditional account” because they would prefer to undermine the side they dislike. 

The side with truth on its side has to then avail itself of the evidence available at its disposal. While it is no guarantee that producing rigorous data/evidence will lead third parties to accept your position (as they may be still blinded by irrational aversion), it gives better chances for you to convince “disinterested” parties of what is sane & reasonable & what is complete nonsense. 

Anyone can come up with any number of nonsensical “traditional” accounts: Eg. Adam’s Bridge, Paraṅgi/Bhṛṅgi Malai, 1400 year old mosque in Bhārata, etc. But the way to convince at least the borderline-reasonable would be to produce solid data.

What helped us win is not whether Rāma was born at Ayodhya (for nobody can “prove” this in the conventional sense even though a billion people including myself believe in it) but whether Hindus had a continuous memory of that spot as a sacred place for Rāma—a question of dry, hard fact. +++(5)+++

### Modulate gurubhakti
Gurubhakti is absolutely not a substitute for the Śruti’s commandment, “Satyam Vada/ Dharmam̐ Cara”. It ought to be subservient to the latter. You can’t make hagiographical claims of events in real time & not expect a rigorous, evidence-based assessment of such claims. 

To approach claims about real-time events with brutal objectivity even if it diminishes your Guru’s legacy to an half or even a mere tenth of the original number of pages of his hagiography - This requires an “Ādhyātmika Pauruṣam/Pum̐ṣṭvam”. The lack of such objectivity comes from an “Ādhyātmika Napum̐sakatvam”. 

No point boasting how much of a “giant” your sampradāya is, if that growth is based on a substantial amount of outrageously ridiculous hagiographies, false attributions & appropriations. The worship of Mithyā will not be rewarded by Īśvara. Also, given the terrible statistic for mukti/jñāna in 1 of your prasthānatrayī, boasting of numerical strength is comically unbefitting.

Boasting “we are doing great work for these causes”, “we alone accomplish so much”, etc & brushing off any honest discussion is even worse. Even worse is to point out irrelevant miracles & anecdotes about your Gurus in order to impress upon others that whatever historical claims they have made must also be true.

It is trite that the occurrence of Siddhis or Adbhutas do not imply omniscience or infallibility. 
So, instead of getting upset at critiques, take a second look at this big balloon of vacuous claims, with honesty & intellectual integrity.

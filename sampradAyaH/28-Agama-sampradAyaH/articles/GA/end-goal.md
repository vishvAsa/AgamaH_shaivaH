Our worship is performed with our bodies, sensory & cognitive instruments & the physical objects (including the offerings/dravya), which are insentient, destructible & amenable to modifications. This is why a Siddhanti has to not only purify his body & internal faculties with mantras (& prepare something known as a Vidyādeha) but has to consecrate the offerings such as food & flowers (which are insentient) with a rite known as Catussaṁskāra, whereby Cit is made to manifest in those insentient substances, as Cit (which is what every Atma really is) is the perfect offering for Paramasiva who is Cidghana.

In Siddhanta, every Atma is fully pervasive like Śiva while the current non-pervasiveness any of us experiences is due to the insentient impurity called Mala.

When we are fully freed from the hold of Mala, Karma & Māyā (which is the raw material for our bodies & faculties), we realize the omniscience, omnipotence & omnipresence we have always had. If we are each an infinite Cidghana unit like Śiva, what is there to speak of Śiva containing us or us containing Him? The moment one realizes this (after being freed from the fetters), that Mukta realizes that he or she is eternally the Cidghana being, one with the Cidghana that was never bound by the fetters +++(in service)+++.  

## View as worship
It is an eternal offering of the Cit in the Cit & we realize that we are performing that highest & purest form of worship. Every soul realizes its independence in mukti. There is no “kainkarya per se” in paramukti. In Siddhānta, the Mukta has no “Lord”. However, **as I view it**, realising one’s Śivatvam & sameness to+++(~~unity with~~)+++ Śiva is itself that purest & highest worship.


## jIvanmukti
Jīvanmukti has nothing to do with preservation of body. It is the attainment of the state of Mukti while still being in the body. If Mukti is defined in this context as freedom from desires & other fluctuations of the mind, then yes, one may say that Siddhānta too holds that to be possible. 

However, be it Kevalādvaita or Siddhānta, the body is always under the effect of Prārabdhakarma and will have to disintegrate one day. 

Body is a Aśuddha-Māyeya (that which is made of Aśuddhamāyā). The body lasts only because of Karma & Karma can operate on even a highly advanced soul because of residual malaśakti. If that malaśakti irreversibly degenerates into a state of non-operation, there will no longer be place for Karma or Māyā to operate.

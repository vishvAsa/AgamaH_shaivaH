There are at least three versions of what we call the "Demiurge", a term used in Platonist, Neoplatonist and Gnostic philosophical texts: 

1. A perfect, powerful and omnibenevolent being that co-exists with evils born of "Necessity" 
2. A non-ultimate & 'ignorant' or ‘imperfect’ being that is benevolent and created the cosmos with good intentions, albeit ending up creating an imperfect one riddled with flaws 
3. An evil being that deliberately creates an evil world 

Īśvara will not fall under any of the above 3 as He does not directly create the cosmos and beings but does so through a chain of intermediaries and it is the higher end of these intermediaries that we are concerned with, in finding parallels with the “Demiurge”.

For the 2nd option, we find a parallel in Brahmā/Prajāpati, who genuinely wants to create a cosmos thriving with beings which will find joy in embodied existence. But given his limitations, he ends up creating a deeply flawed cosmos that includes net-negative entities. 

For the 1st option, we have Ananta Vidyeśvara in Saiddhāntika Śaivam, who is given overlordship of all creation in the impure plane (Aśuddhādhvā) though He Himself resides in the Śuddhādhvā, is practically equal to Īśvara and genuinely wants to help souls find their way to Śiva through the intervention of Mantras (whom He lords & whose liberation/spiritual progress He directly facilitates)—Yes, He not only commands Mantras to facilitate our progress but He facilitates the progress of even those very Mantras.

Mutatis mutandis in "we have Ananta Vidyeśvara in Saiddhāntika Śaivam"  - applies to viShNu in shrIvaiShNavism.

Overall, an exceedingly benevolent entity who has to contend with both the eternal reality of Mala (the beginningless impurity that stains all souls except Śiva and the liberated) as well as the infinite number of souls & work within these constraints (since eternal things cannot be destroyed & infinite souls means that Ananta has to keep the creation and dissolution cycles ongoing). 

Now, what about the 3rd option? An evil being who genuinely wants to introduce evil into creation? Do we have a parallel for this version of the Demiurge?

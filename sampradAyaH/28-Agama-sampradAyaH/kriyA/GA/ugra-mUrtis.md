4 forms of Vișņu are singled out as examples of Ugra Vișņumūrtis in Śrīmat-Kāmikāgama: Viśvarūpa, Vațapatraśāyī, Narasimha & Paraśurāma (& the first two can be seen as particularly Kārșņeya forms).

These forms + Bhagavān’s Ugramūrtis (Gajāri, Kāmāri, Kālāri & Tripurāri) are recommended to be kept at the village’s outskirts in the north-east.

I will make a remark. सिद्धान्ती अर्चक-s are truly very blessed among temple priesthoods. While आगमिक priesthoods in general are vastly more resourced in giving a proper basis for their rituals, I have always felt that सिद्धान्ती-s went many an extra mile in this direction.

I am not too sure how many सिद्धान्त-शिवाचार्य-s follow me here. Perhaps, less than 5. In any case, I hope how fortunate they are. And I will explain it very briefly.

-The number of commentaries you have on your क्रियापाद texts (portions of the आगम-s that deal with ritual) & विद्यापाद-s (portions dealing with metaphysical wisdom)
- अघोरशिवपद्धति with निर्मलमणिदेशिक's commentary that gives a deeper meaning for the smallest of details 
- सोमशम्भुपद्धति with त्रिलोचनशिवाचार्य's commentary

सिद्धान्ती अर्चक-s truly owe to their forebears to be able to give complete, rigorous and enriching explanations for every tiny detail of the rituals they do. There are still many who can. And we hope more will do so.

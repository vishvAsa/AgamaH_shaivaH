> "According to Ramakantha the scriptures of the Saiva Siddhanta teach that salvation can only be attained by ritual. To be bound to the cycle of death and rebirth (samsara) is to be ignorant of one's true nature, but knowledge of that nature cannot bring that bondage to an end. 
> 
> This is because the absence of liberated self-awareness is caused by impurity (mala). This cannot be removed by knowledge, because it is a substance (dravya). Being a substance it can be destroyed only by action and the only action capable of destroying it is the system of ritual prescribed in the Saiva scriptures.

This prose by Sanderson is a slight misrepresentation of the Siddhānta’s message. The fundamental contrast is between knowledge and Śiva’s action, not formal ritual per se. 

The word for Initiation, “Dīkșā” is actually understood by the great Master Sadyojyoti (who predates Rāmakaņțha & is revered by him) in the broader sense of Śiva’s action. Dīkșā, in fact, is Śiva’s innate power (Śakti) that is inseparable from Śiva and is Śiva qua in relation to all other existents. 

Various types of ritual initiation (depending on background of initiate) are species of “Śiva’s action” or different forms of Śakti. The idea is that a substance obscuring one’s own innate nature beginninglessly needs to be made non-operative through Śiva’s action/Śakti.

This is why Bhagavān Sadyojyoti leaves it open for Dīkșā to mean Śiva’s knowledge, will/desire, etc as Śiva’s will/knowledge/desire to grace are all nothing my but mere names of Śakti.

And yet, dIxA requires positive action from the to-be-dIxita, right?

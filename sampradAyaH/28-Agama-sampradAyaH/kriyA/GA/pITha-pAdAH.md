The पञ्चासन of सैद्धान्तिक ritual - A "super-throne" made of five layers. So, one can see the four lions on one of the layers (the सिंहासन layer of the पञ्चासन).

What is the significance of these four lions?  
The 4 lions are धर्म, ज्ञान, वैराग्य & ऐश्वर्य. This is clear.

Now, in the साङ्ख्या, these 4 are the भाव-s of the बुद्धि, apart from the 4 counterparts: अधर्म, अज्ञान, अवैराग्य & अनैश्वर्य. 

However, if understood this way, it presents a problem for a सिद्धान्ती. What is that? See, in सिद्धान्त-शैवम्, the 36 तत्त्व-s are grouped into three categories:

1. आत्मतत्त्व-s - अशुद्धतत्त्व-s - (1-24)
2. विद्यातत्त्व-s अशुद्धतत्त्व-s - (25-31)
3. शिवतत्त्व-s शुद्धतत्त्व-s - (32-36)

Categories 1 and 2 (green and purple in the above image) are overall, "impure". They are part of the metaphysical architecture responsible for a soul being a bound beast, for the soul being a "पशु".

So, if the four lions in the five-layered throne, namely, धर्म, ज्ञान, वैराग्य & ऐश्वर्य are the भाव-s of the बुद्धि and बुद्धि is in Category 1 (green in the above image), how can a सिद्धान्ती, in good conscience, worship something so hierarchically low in his ritual?

And the 10th century सैद्धान्तिक आचार्य of काश्मीर-देश, भट्ट-रामकण्ठ, points out the foolishness of thinking so and explains what they really are, in his commentary on the सार्धत्रिशतिकालोत्तरागम -

> 'धर्मादयस् त्व् एते ऽनन्तस्य सामर्थ्य-विशेषाः,  
> यैः सर्वं धत्ते जानाति, न केनचिदनुरज्यते,  
> सर्वेश्वरश्च भवतीति ।  
> न तु बुद्धिधर्मा इति मौर्ख्याद् व्याख्येयं, तेषाम् अत्र प्रगमासंभवात् ।  
> न चेह पशवः पाशाश् चेज्यन्ते यतः ।

> Translation: [The properties such as] धर्म, etc are the special abilities of अनन्त by which [he] sustains everything, knows [everything], [by which he] is not impassioned by anything and becomes the lord of everything; thus [it is to be explained].  
> 
> Not thus as the characteristics of बुद्धि are they to be explained out of stupidity, because of the non-occurrence of the coming of those [धर्म, ज्ञान, वैराग्य & ऐश्वर्य as the properties of बुद्धि instead] here [into the शुद्ध/pure realm]. And since, here [in the सिद्धान्त system], bonds (पाश-s) and bound souls (पशु-s) are not worshiped.


Now, there are few more things I can note here. But I will stop here for now. Note how a 10th-century commentary written in काश्मीर-देश helps explain what one may dismiss as some feature of a ritual object that one may see today only in temples in TN.

In the सिद्धान्त, ritual and metaphysics are inseparably intertwined and a small feature (such as the four lions) can serve as an aid to teach one so much about the deep philosophy of the सिद्धान्त.

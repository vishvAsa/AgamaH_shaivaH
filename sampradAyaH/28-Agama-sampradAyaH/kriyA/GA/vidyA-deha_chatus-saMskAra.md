Our worship is performed with our bodies, sensory & cognitive instruments & the physical objects (including the offerings/dravya), which are insentient, destructible & amenable to modifications. This is why a Siddhanti has to not only purify his body & internal faculties with mantras (& prepare something known as a Vidyādeha) but has to consecrate the offerings such as food & flowers (which are insentient) with a rite known as Catussaṁskāra, whereby Cit is made to manifest in those insentient substances, as Cit (which is what every Atma really is) is the perfect offering for Paramasiva who is Cidghana.

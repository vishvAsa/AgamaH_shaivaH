One must be very very careful when presenting the story of nandanār. 

The story as presented in the thread is not true. It was cooked up by a narcissistic śivadrohī named gopālakṛṣṇa, who would rather distort the story of nandanār in order to promote his own “Creative vision” than be faithful to cēkkizhār’s original story. This cooked up story of a wicked mind was the inspiration for that stupid film, “nandanār”. The oldest version of nandanār’s life is from periyapurāṇam.

Nandanār did not have any employer. Cēkkizhār doesn’t know of any landlord employer. When Cēkkizhār first introduces Nandanār (after his usual poetic description of the village, etc), he already mentions that Nandanār is one with hereditary rights. 

The original verse: [thevaaram](http://www.thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/songview.php?thiru=12&Song_idField=1218&padhi=72&startLimit=11&limitPerPage=1&sortBy=&sortOrder=DESC)

What is the exact phrase (in above link) that Cēkkizhār uses to describe Nandanār, who was born in the pulaya community?

> “ஊர்ப்புலைமை யான்றதொழில் தாயத்தார்”

What does this mean?

The pulayas/paRaiyas rendered various kinds of services for a town/village: cleaning, various goods (leather, etc) & other works. Due to the essential nature of these works, the kings, particularly the cōzhas, allocated them tax-free land.

I had earlier covered here how under cōzha kings, the paRaiya-s/pulayas were often the only ones who were granted such tax free lands, apart from Temples, monasteries & vaidika brāhmaṇas, who were granted the brahmadeya/brāhmadeya lands. Returning to this verse we saw here:

> ஊர்ப்புலைமை யான்றதொழில் தாயத்தார்  
ūrppulaimai yāndratõzhil dāyattār

What does this mean?  
Because of his hereditary occupation (tõzhil) as a pulaiya of that town (ūr), he was one with land rights (dāya).

Those who can read tamizh can refer to the additional commentary on that verse [here](https://twitter.com/ghorangirasa/status/1264575757910593541?s=21): & also see this additional commentary here on the [word](https://ta.m.wikisource.org/wiki/
http://www.tamilvu.org/slet/l4100/l4100pd1.jsp?bookid=120&part=II&pno=1369), தாயம்/dāyam


So, Nandanār was not a peasant working on the fields under a cruel landlord! He had rights in his own land himself by virtue of the services his clan was providing for a cōzha town for generations! It takes a especially perverted mind (referring to gopālakṛṣṇa, not the OP) to distort the story like this. 

Also, Nandanār is never mentioned as working in the fields. His actual occupation is also precisely stated by Cēkkizhār in his beautiful periyapurāṇam. The original verse [here](http://www.thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/songview.php?thiru=12&Song_idField=1218&padhi=72&startLimit=13&limitPerPage=1&sortBy=&sortOrder=DESC)

Cēkkizhār again takes the pain to mention that Nandanār derived his sustenance from the துடவை/tuḍavai (the fields granted to the pulaya community at that time for their sustenance). But he himself did other work.

He supplied, in a righteous way, the leather required to make bheri-s, the sacred drums required in all āgamika Temples even today, as well as other “mukha-karuvi-s”, musical instruments with “faces” like drums where you have to hit on one of its “faces” to play it. He also supplied leather for the coverings of musical instruments. He supplied binding materials for fastening these coverings to the instruments securely. He would supply the guts from dead animals to make stringed instruments such as vīṇā & yāzh.

Whatever the work he traditionally did, he always found a way to utilise his hereditary craft for the sake of Śiva. This point is clearly expressed by Cēkkizhār:

What is the phrase Cēkkizhār uses?

> வருபிறப்பின் வழிவந்த அறம்புரிகொள்கையராயே அடித்தொண்டின் நெறிநின்றார்  
varupiRappin vazhivanda aRampurikõLgaiyarāyē aḍittõṇḍin nẽRininḍrār

Cēkkizhār states that Nandanār’s conviction/goal was such that he stood in the śāsana/dharma (nẽRi) of the service of Śiva’s feet while carrying out the dharma (aRam) thar has come to him by way of heredity. Cēkkizhār is actually rephrasing a renowned āgamika verse in tamizh here. Is anyone willing to figure out the sam̐skṛta inspiration behind this tamizh verse?

This is the āgamika vākya that seems to have inspired Cēkkizhār:

वर्णाश्रमाचारान् मनसापि न लङ्घयेत् ॥ यो यस्मिन्नाश्रमे तिष्ठन् प्राप्तो दीक्षां शिवात्मिकाम् । स तस्मिन्नेव संतिष्ठन् शिवधर्मं च पालयेत् - श्रीमद्भार्गवागमः,

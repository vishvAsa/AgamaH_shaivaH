## 3 shaktis
Paramashiva has an inseparable shivashakti, which, though one, acts in different phases:icchA, kriyA and jnAna. There is a high level of trimUrtis, which are identified with these shaktis.

A liberated soul, in the state of shivasAmya, manifests its own shivashakti (every soul has its own, innate cicchakti), that can manifest its own brahmA/viSNu/rudra-rUpa icchA/jnAna/kriyA phases.

## Pervasiveness
Śiva, Śakti and Muktas (and their Cicchaktis) are all-pervasive; so they will be within Māyātattvas as well. However, they are described as being separate from and beyond the 36 Tattvas, as they are pure Cit and eternally unrestricted by any delimitation due to insentients. 

If one says that Paramaśiva’s (the supreme sentient) Cicchakti (His sentience) manifests in 3 phases and those 3 phases are to be known by the names of trimūrtis, it would not make sense to say His Śaktis are here or there. As is the Śaktimān, so is His Śakti. 

All pervasive yet untainted by the insentients they pervade. Māyā is to be divided into Śuddhamāyā/Bindu & Aśuddhamāyā. Tattvas are insentients. Ātmās are sentients.

### Difference from lower trimUrtis
We can speak of the lower trimūrtis as pervading up to this tattva or that because they are separate souls which are not fully liberated.

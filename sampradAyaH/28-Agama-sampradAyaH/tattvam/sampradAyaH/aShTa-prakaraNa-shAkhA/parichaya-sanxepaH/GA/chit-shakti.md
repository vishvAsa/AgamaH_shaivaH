## 3 shaktis
In Siddhānta, Paramaśiva is said to be non-different from its innate Cicchakti (Parāśakti)—in the same way every Ātmā is said to be non-different from its innate, unique Cicchakti. The Śaktimān (possessor of Śakti) and its Śakti are capable of being spoken distinctly but are not considered ontologically separate/distinct entities.

This Parāśakti is singular but manifests in different ways/phases: Icchā, Jñāna & Kriyā.

Paramashiva has an inseparable shivashakti, which, though one, acts in different phases:icchA, kriyA and jnAna. There is a high level of trimUrtis, which are identified with these shaktis.

A liberated soul, in the state of shivasAmya, manifests its own shivashakti (every soul has its own, innate cicchakti), that can manifest its own brahmA/viSNu/rudra-rUpa icchA/jnAna/kriyA phases.

These three phases of the singular Śakti that is innate to and non-different from Paramaśiva are identified by the same names of the Trimūrtis though Pūrvācārya-grantha clarified that they do not denote the Trimūrtis popularly known. The lower Trimūrtis denote actual souls.

### abheda
Whenever someone speaks of ‘abheda’, they are having in mind the abheda of two souls, whose distinct individualities are, according to them, only apparent i.e. merely an appearance. They accept that at least in a lower level of reality, there are two separate souls.

This is not taught in the Siddhānta. There is no abheda of souls and individuality is absolutely real. The abheda of Ātmā & its innate Cicchakti is what is implied in the case of the last-mentioned Vișņu.

## Pervasiveness
Śiva, Śakti and Muktas (and their Cicchaktis) are all-pervasive; so they will be within Māyātattvas as well. However, they are described as being separate from and beyond the 36 Tattvas, as they are pure Cit and eternally unrestricted by any delimitation due to insentients. 

If one says that Paramaśiva’s (the supreme sentient) Cicchakti (His sentience) manifests in 3 phases and those 3 phases are to be known by the names of trimūrtis, it would not make sense to say His Śaktis are here or there. As is the Śaktimān, so is His Śakti. 

All pervasive yet untainted by the insentients they pervade. Māyā is to be divided into Śuddhamāyā/Bindu & Aśuddhamāyā. Tattvas are insentients. Ātmās are sentients.

### Difference from lower trimUrtis
We can speak of the lower trimūrtis as pervading up to this tattva or that because they are separate souls which are not fully liberated.

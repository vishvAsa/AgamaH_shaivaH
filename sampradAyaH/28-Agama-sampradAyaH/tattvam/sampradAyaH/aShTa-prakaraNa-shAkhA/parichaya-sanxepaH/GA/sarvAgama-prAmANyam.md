Siddhānta conception of “Sarvāgamaprāmāṇya” (the authoritativeness of all religious teachings).

1. All religious teachings are valid up to the extent of the highest tattva they impart. By tattva, the Siddhānta refers to 1 of the 36 tattvas.
2. Thus, they are not all equally valid since the highest tattva each teaches is different. The Siddhānta thus gives general guidelines as to this tattva-based hierarchy of religious conceptions.
3. Of course, sects evolve; the metaphysics gets upgraded & the highest tattva the praxis claims to reach to is now higher than before. But the basic insight of the Siddhānta remains useful.
4. Since the Abrahmas teach 1 body for 1 soul, bodily resurrection, etc, they are going to rank very very Low on the tattva scale. However, their praxis may be potent for souls which have committed themselves to that system.
5. Although Siddhānta texts don’t speak of Abrahmas, we can use the general principles & analogous reasoning to conclude their tattva-rank. Note that even this highest tattva is just a potential end. The average Abrahma, in doing Deva/Veda-Nindana, won’t get even this fruit.
6. In the course of thinking about the question if there is any possibility of an Abrahma attaining his maximum potential under his or her religion, I came across ibn arabi who found a way to reconcile idol worship with his religion. As a “thought experiment”, perhaps someone like Ibn Arabi may attain his maximum potential.

## Non-demonization

In the Mūla-Śaiva-Siddhānta, Paramaśiva by His Anugraha empowers certain souls to be pravartakas of Sampradāyas to cater to the needs of different souls, with these Anyasampradāyas mostly leading souls to good ends on the Tattva-Tāratamya (albeit lower), while the Siddhānta leads one to the state beyond the Tattvas. No Sampradāya will suit all. A soul needs to become mature before it becomes ripe for the Siddhānta. 

No Asurāvatāra idea is taught in relation to even Nāstika Sampradāyas, let alone fellow Āstika Sampradāyas. 

The only Sampradāya condemned as leading to an evil end is one which teaches its followers to practice debased rituals rooted in himsā & lust.

One of the things that makes the Siddhānta very appealing to me is its zero demonization of Anyasampradāyas. Another is the zero emphasis on eschatology (good vs evil battle manifesting through historical events, rival religions being works of evil minds, etc).  

Eschatology has been important in the Sāmānya-Śāstras (although not at an obsessive level), which are a bit removed from the blessed presence of the Śaiva Śāstras. It’s also worth noting that eschatology is absent in the Śruti as a matter of concern (as is the case with the Siddhānta), it becomes an object of obsession in the Abrahma durāgamas.

Projecting weakness as a strength.  

Also wonder reg. vitriol - if veda-s have some parallel to the "shiva-dveSha"/ shaiva-droha type concepts, beyond just scorn for dasyus. Maybe they were just so dominant they didn't need it.

Minus flaws like preferring Abrahamisms, "demon-deluded" seems functional antigen, like other comparable labels. What special liabilities there?

The vaidika seem to have come to their senses by mImAMsaka/ paurANika time with labels veda-bAhya, nAstika, moha-shAstra etc.. Better late than never maybe. Thankfully, some of their quasi-rivals were sayuthyas.

Benefits clear - good way of dealing with actual wolves in sheep clothing & consolidation. As an example of clarity, observe the sheer power of "ekarAxasavAda", "unmAda" and "rAxasAlaya". If, say, the shaivas or vaidikas can't be that clear, their "magnanimity" in that area is flawed.

Come to think of it (just a hypothesis now) - Could it be that, like buddhus, shaivas were specially susceptible to the marus, considering kAshmIra and Indonesia?? And the fall of khmer to bauddhas...

## Assimilation

You are conflating the ability to ‘other’ real enemies of Dharma with demonizing fellow Āstikas & also conflating the demonization of actual enemies & demonization of their religions.  

One can see 2 examples:

The Tamizh Śaiva Bhakti tradition actually holds that the Jainas violated their own precepts by attempting evil things against Sambandhar, holds that it is Śiva who graces them through their own paths, while completely othering the actual followers and subjugating them. 

Where Bauddhas were not a threat, Śaivam syncretized with it & absorbed it (like Indonesia). 

Śaivam anticipated the current form of Hinduism and its unity (case in point: the Niśvāsamukha tradition, about which we have written before).

In contrast, demonizing others’ Ācāryas creates potential liabilities for the Dharma as a whole, while conferring no benefit at the same time. 

## Bad othering
Even worse, we have examples of those who abused Advaitīs with terrible words while holding at the same time that Yeśu & Mohamatta were Śaktyāveśa avatāras. As we see in the real world, some people loathe their own families while being friendly & pliant with strangers. 

Likewise, this completely internally directed othering, complemented by wide grins towards hostile aliens, is a useless form of othering that confers no benefit in the Dharma.

Siddhānta conception of “Sarvāgamaprāmāṇya” (the authoritativeness of all religious teachings).

1. All religious teachings are valid up to the extent of the highest tattva they impart. By tattva, the Siddhānta refers to 1 of the 36 tattvas.
2. Thus, they are not all equally valid since the highest tattva each teaches is different. The Siddhānta thus gives general guidelines as to this tattva-based hierarchy of religious conceptions.
3. Of course, sects evolve; the metaphysics gets upgraded & the highest tattva the praxis claims to reach to is now higher than before. But the basic insight of the Siddhānta remains useful.
4. Since the Abrahmas teach 1 body for 1 soul, bodily resurrection, etc, they are going to rank very very Low on the tattva scale. However, their praxis may be potent for souls which have committed themselves to that system.
5. Although Siddhānta texts don’t speak of Abrahmas, we can use the general principles & analogous reasoning to conclude their tattva-rank. Note that even this highest tattva is just a potential end. The average Abrahma, in doing Deva/Veda-Nindana, won’t get even this fruit.
6. In the course of thinking about the question if there is any possibility of an Abrahma attaining his maximum potential under his or her religion, I came across ibn arabi who found a way to reconcile idol worship with his religion. As a “thought experiment”, perhaps someone like Ibn Arabi may attain his maximum potential.

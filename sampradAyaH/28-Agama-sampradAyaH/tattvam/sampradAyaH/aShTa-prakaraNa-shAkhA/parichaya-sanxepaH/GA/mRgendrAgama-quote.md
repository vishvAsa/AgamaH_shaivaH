## Intro
My favorite śloka in the Mṛgendrāgama, revealed by Devendra to Bharadvāja-Ṛṣi. 🙏🏾 

> शैवे सिद्धे भाति मूर्ध्नीतरेषां  
> मुक्तस् सृष्टौ पुंवरोऽभ्येति नाधः ।  
> विश्वान् अर्थान् स्वेन विष्टभ्य धाम्ना  
> सर्वेशानान् ईरितस् सर्वदास्ते ॥ २९ ॥
> 
> “In the perfection [obtained] in the Śaiva [path], [He] shines above all others.  
> The liberated one, at [the start of the next] creation, is a supreme person; he falls down not.  
> Being never impelled by the [supreme] lord of all (i.e. Paramaśiva), by his own powers,  
> he pervades all objects of existence.

- In Siddhānta, it is a very unique & important belief that the liberated soul is completely equal with Śiva & is not driven or commanded by Him. The Siddhānta is unique in maintaining an uncompromising theism (Īśvaraprādhānya) & also the position that a liberated soul is no slave to anyone, even Paramaśiva, & that Paramaśiva’s function of grace is to enable everyone to eventually realize their innate equality with Him.  
- At the same time, the Siddhānta avoids the problem of multiple Īśvaras with its unique perspective without compromising its assertion that the liberated soul is equal to Paramaśiva in every respect. 
- The Siddhānta is also unique in maintaining the Kartṛtva of souls in mukti & goes against the long trend of vilifying the Kartṛtva/agency of souls.

## multiple-Īśvaras - classic solutions
Historically, most schools have taken the “multiple-Īśvara” problem for granted. “Each liberated soul will think differently & act differently, causing chaos.” That’s the classic refrain & the solution was to place restrictions on the powers of the mukta. Is this sensible? Many don’t stop to think why a mukta would in the first place be impelled to “have things his way” or oppose what Īśvara has put in place?! Why should there be chaos? And this is how the Siddhānta approaches the problem.

Śrī-Sadyojyoti summarizes the classic view of the opponent: “In the case of the liberated attaining sameness with Śiva, the Kāraṇas (the supreme causes; i.e. Īśvaras) become many. Due to the non-uniformity of their buddhis among the liberated, no action will be possible.” 

Śrī-Rāmakaṇṭha comments: Among the liberated, in the case of their omnipotence like Īśvara, due to conflicting buddhis such as “let this be new”, “let this be old”, all acts will become non-productive/naught. Thus, for the liberated, there is only omniscience. Omnipotence is admitted for only Parameśvara.”

## siddhAnta solution
Thus, we have seen the opponent’s position so far. This is no fault (naiṣa doṣaḥ), says Śrī-Sadyojyoti. Due to being connected with [faults such as] passion, aversion, etc, there is non-sameness of buddhi among men (i.e. bound souls in general). For muktas, divergent desires due to non-uniformity of buddhi are not there. The liberated souls, those who have been perfected in the Siddhānta; they are free from faults such as passion (rāgādidoṣanirmuktāḥ), their intelligence has all [of existence] in its range. (sarvagocarabuddhayaḥ). Thus comments Śrī-Rāmakaṇṭha. 

The point being implied is that when the mukta is free from faults such as passion, aversion, etc & omniscient:

1. The mukta will have conflicting desires with other liberated ones.
2. Our will to act is always based on our limited knowledge of what is good or important. The mukta’s will to act will always be that of one who has limitless knowledge. Thus, Śiva & muktas form an “omniscient community of souls of a united will”.
3. Thus, it can be said that these infinite muktas act spontaneously in conformity with their supremely elevated will without ever being impelled by attraction, aversion, jealousy, sadness, etc.
4. As an additional point, one could say that because they are all omniscient, their spontaneous acts can never interfere with or frustrate each other even accidentally.

Thus, there can be no difference of opinion (abhiprāyabheda) among the muktas; whether between anādimukta (beginninglessly free) Paramaśiva & the ādimuktas or between the ādimuktas themselves. The perfect Will of an omniscient being free from all flaws is shared by an infinite community of muktas & is perfectly carried out, without conflict or redundancy in an infinite number of ways by the infinitely numbered muktas, while pañcakṛtya rests with Paramaśiva alone.

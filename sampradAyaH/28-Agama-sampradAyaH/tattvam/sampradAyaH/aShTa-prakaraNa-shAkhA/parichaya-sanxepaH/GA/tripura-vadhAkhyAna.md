The Taittirīya-Saṁhitā version of the Tripuravadha-ākhyāna relates that Rudra asks for a boon from the Devas before He destroys the three forts of the Asuras (which He alone is said to be able to destroy since He is the “cruel” one). The boon is the lordship of Paśus, which is usually rendered as (domestic) animals.

But the surface-level meaning appears superficial & in compelling. Yes, Rudra’s “wrath” is seen to affect cows, horses & other animals belonging to the Yajamāna/sacrificer. However, He clearly does much more than that. He & His Rudras are said to exercise control over humans & the Veda makes it clear that even the Devas are controlled by Rudra from within (He is the very hearts of the Devas) & they are attacked by Him when they commit a wrong. 

Thus, the Veda’s version of the story already invites us to think deeper. It is in this context that the versions in the Liṅga & Śiva Purāṇas flesh out the inner meaning of the “lordship of paśus”. It is not a mere lordship of animals but the lordship of any soul that is bound by the fetters (pāśa/bond) of Mala, Karma & Māyā. That is the Paśu/पशु i.e. That which is bound by Pāśa-s/पाश-s.

That this is the real meaning is also suggested in a verse of the Tamizh Śaiva work, Tirumantram, a compendium of 3000+ verses attributed to the sage, Tirumūlar, who identifies the three forts of the Asuras with the three bonds: Mala, Karma & Māyā.

It is also interesting that the word for the state of being a Paśu/bound soul, Paśutvam, is often interchangeably used with Āṇavatvam (the state of being an Aṇu/atom—That is, a false attribution of atomicity/limited individuality to oneself. “I am this. He is that”).

In this context, it’s useful to note the following. Appayya Dīkṣita cites the Paurāṇika story together with a passage from the Bṛhadāraṇyaka-Upaniṣad, where a man, who sees himself as one & the Deva he worships as another, is deemed to be a paśu for the Devas to enjoy. 

> ब्रह्म वा इदमग्र आसीत्, तदात्मानमेवावेत् ‘अहं ब्रह्मास्मि’ इति । तस्मात् तत् सर्वमभवत्तद्यो यो देवानां प्रत्यबुध्यत स एव तदभवत्तथर्षीणां तथा मनुष्याणां  
> तद्धेतत् पश्यन्न् ऋषिर् वामदेवः प्रतिपेदेऽहं मनुरभवं सूर्यश्चेति ।  
> तदिदम् अप्येतर्हि य एवं वेदाहं ब्रह्मास्मीति  
> स इदं सर्वं भवति

> यथा ह वै बहवः पशवो मनुष्यं भुञ्जयुर्  
> एवम् एकैकः पुरुषो देवान् भुनक्त्य्

The Devas are clearly unhappy when a man attains the knowledge of his innate Brahmatvam (or Śivatvam as the Siddhānta puts it) because such a man realizes his all-pervasiveness & “becomes” [or rather realizes his eternal state as] the very soul/Ātmā of those Devas, that they cannot conquer him. 

This reminds one of the verse from the Śatarudriyam, “Devānām̐ hrdayebhyo”, where Rudra is addressed as the very hearts of the Devas. On a deeper level, this refers to Paramaśiva & the now-liberated Śivas (Ādimukta-Śivas), who are all simultaneously realized in their power to control all of existence, including the very Devas from within, by virtue of their all-pervasiveness. 

While the Devas in that passage of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka treat humans as Paśus to be controlled & exploited, Paramaśiva, through His agent Śrīkaṇṭharudra, puts those very Devas in their place by making them acknowledge their own Paśutvam (state of being bound), since they are clearly under the control of Mala as well as the selfish desires & attachment to their limited individualities that Mala leads to. 

## Cruelty
Further to the above, another thing in the passage from the Taittirīya-Saṁhitā that must catch one’s attention is that Rudra’s eligibility for destroying the three forts is His especial “cruelty”. 

Indra literally recounts his cruel deeds, including the breaking of peace treaties with Asuras & throwing his enemies to the brutal Śālāvṛkas (hyenas). Indra destroyed 99 forts of Śambara.

Agni, Viṣṇu, Soma, Varuṇa, etc are all associated with Asura/Rakṣas-killing & inflicting pains on the wicked. 

So, why is Rudra being singled out for “cruelty”? 

The inner meaning is this: Every bound soul is so intimately intertwined with Mala, Karma & Māyeya (body, mind, intellect, etc) that it feels cruel for them to hurt what they have identified themselves with, wrongly through delusion. 

See this for more understanding: 👉🏾https://x.com/ghorangirasa/status/1785507276813726087?s=46

“Every bound Ātmā is very tightly tied to a Jaḍa-samūha (a community of insentients): 

1. Malaśakti (one of the infinite individual energies of Mala acting on a particular soul—Mala is the internal impurity which obscures an Ātmā’s innate potential from manifesting)

2. A beginningless stream of Karmaphalas

3. Māyeya (products of Māyā - Bodies, sensory faculties)

As a result, the Ātmā experiences the Anugraha together with this Jaḍa-samūha, with which it has beginninglessly “chosen” to identify. It will not be able to directly savour this Anugraha till the Mala starts to ripen.”

Coming back, Paramaśiva, who is figuratively represented through Rudra in the story, is eternally free from the binding power of the insentients. 

The great master of the Siddhānta, Bhagavān Sadyojyoti, calls Him Pāśapratipakṣī; the “enemy” of the Pāśas. This is what makes Him “cruel”.

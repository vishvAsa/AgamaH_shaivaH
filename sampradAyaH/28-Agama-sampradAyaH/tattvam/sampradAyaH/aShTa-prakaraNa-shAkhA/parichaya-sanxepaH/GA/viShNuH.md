A Saiddhāntika cannot hate Vișņu. There are at least 3 levels of Vișņu (in my estimation, 4) in Saiddhāntika metaphysics & each of them has an importance for us.

The lowest Vișņu is himself one of the saptaguru-s.  
One of the higher Vișņus is someone an Ācārya has to worship in Dīkșā and offer the Dīkșita’s sensory faculties to him as ‘sulka’ for purification.  
A yet higher one is one of Āvaraņadevatas in the Caturthāvaraņa, worshiped in the daily Pañcāvaraņa-Pūjā.

The yet higher one (the highest Vișņu) is essentially non-different from Paramaśiva and is identical to one of His 3 Śaktis (see [chit-shakti](../chit-shakti) note). Vișņu at the highest level is not a soul but a Śakti of Paramaśiva. I am not saying: this highest viSNu is a soul that is non-different from paramashiva (who is a distinct soul). The other three viSNu-s are separate souls.

## Post attainment
To make it clear, a soul can do appropriate sAdhana and can attain the post of the 3 lower viSNus but the 4th and highest viSNu is not something that can be attained as it is innate to paramashiva.

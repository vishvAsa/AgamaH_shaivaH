A Saiddhāntika cannot hate Vișņu. There are at least 3 levels of Vișņu (in my estimation, 4) in Saiddhāntika metaphysics & each of them has an importance for us.

The lowest Vișņu is himself one of the saptaguru-s.  
One of the higher Vișņus is someone an Ācārya has to worship in Dīkșā and offer the Dīkșita’s sensory faculties to him as ‘sulka’ for purification.  
A yet higher one is one of Āvaraņadevatas in the Caturthāvaraņa, worshiped in the daily Pañcāvaraņa-Pūjā.

The yet higher one (the highest Vișņu) is essentially non-different from Paramaśiva and is identical to one of His 3 Śaktis.

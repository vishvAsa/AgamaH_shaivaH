## pashu shAstra
> What exactly do you mean by paśuśāstras ? Would श्रीमद भगवद्गीता be an example of one such शास्त्र? I don't understand the distinction? Could you elaborate?

Yes, even if a śāstra may subtly hint at higher truths, it would be a Paśuśāstra insofar as it does not reveal the higher tattvas taught by the Siddhānta. Such śāstras are given to Paśus (bonded souls) for their edification but are, by no means, effective in leading them to the highest state because they are not revealing the higher tattvas or recognizing the existence of mala, the root cause of all sufferings & limitations. Any Śāstra centered around the paratvam of an entity other than the only one who is beginninglessly without mala (Paramaśiva)—this would be a Paśuśāstra.

## mahAbhArata example
In this thread, we have looked at a number of incidents from the Mahābhārata. We take 2 of them & see how Sañjaya describes or narrates them. What are the 2 incidents?

1. The battle between Arjuna & Śrīkaṇṭharudra in the form of a Kirata; and 
2. The final battle between Arjuna & Karṇa, where Aśvasena manages to break Arjuna’s kirīṭa.

What does this have to do with the Śaiva view? The subject matter is Jñāna gained through Pati-Śāstra & Pati-mata (the scriptures & religion approved by Paramaśiva for our highest good) versus Jñāna gained through Paśu-Śāstra & Paśu-mata (scriptures & religions given by Paśus).

### Sources
What is the link with Sañjaya’s narration of the two events? We will see that in this thread. We first link both Sam̐skṛta originals & Ganguli’s fairly reliable translations of the same. 

1. The battle between Arjuna & Śrīkaṇṭharudra in the form of a Kirata hunter: Original: Kumbhakoṇa Edition👇🏾 Ganguli’s translation:

2. The final battle between Arjuna & Karṇa, where Aśvasena breaks Arjuna’s kirīṭa: Originals - Ganguli appears to have used manuscripts used by both Kumbhakoṇa & BORI editions & others too perhaps. So, we will link the relevant chapters in both editions for the interested.

Now, if you have read the translations in relation to Sañjaya’s narrations of both incidents, did you notice anything interesting?

### Śrīkaṇṭharudra vs Arjuna
Let’s see the 1st issue. Sañjaya recounts the battle between Bhagavān Śrīkaṇṭharudra & Arjuna in the context of Arjuna’s great exploits & agrees with Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s remark (in previous chapter) that Arjuna is invincible against the Kauravas. Now, in the previous chapter, Vaiśampāyana recounts Dhṛtarāṣṭra as saying the following, among other things:

#### Sañjaya's account
Essentially, Dhṛtarāṣṭra says that Arjuna, equal in heroism to the lord of the Tridaśa/Devas (Indra), satisfied Agni with his valiant services at Khāṇḍava & defeated all kings of the earth for Yudhiṣṭhira’s Rājasūya. And also that, unlike a Vajra that will leave a remainder after falling on a mountain, Arjuna will leave no remainder of his 100 sons.

Sañjaya enthusiastically agrees with this assessment but adds a reference to the Kiratārjunīya, with some “facts” of his own. What does he say?  

> महेश्वरेण यो राजन्  
> न जीर्णो ग्रस्तमूर्तिमान् ।  
> कस् तम् उत्सहते वीरो  
> युद्धे जरयितुं पुमान् ॥ Variant: **अष्टमूर्तिमान्

Sañjaya rhetorically asks who could be strong enough to cause Arjuna to wither when he could not be weakened/withered by even Maheśvara? What a strange way of describing Arjuna’s encounter with Śrīkaṇṭharudra?!

#### Vyāsa's account
How does Vyāsa describe the same incident? 

> तत एनं महादेवः  
> पीड्य गात्रैः सुपीडितम्।  
> तेजसा व्याक्रमद् रोषाच्  
> चेतस् तस्य विमोहयन् ॥ 3-39-61 
> 
> “Then, महादेव having pressed with His body the already pressed/injured one (अर्जुन), by His तेजस् He bewildered his (अर्जुन’s) consciousness.”

And Vyāsa continues: 

> ततोऽभिपीडितैर्गात्रैः  
> पिण्डीकृत इवाबभौ।  
> फल्गुनो गात्रसंरुद्धो  
> देवदेवेन भारत ॥  
> 
> 3-39-62 

Here, अर्जुन is described as having become a lump of his mangled body/flesh.

> निरुच्छ्वासोऽभवच् चैव  
> सन्निरुद्धो महामनाः। 
> 
> अर्जुन became breathless (nirucchvāso’bhavet) & was as if he was dead (caiva sanniruddho), with his body becoming restrained (no force or movement).

With this being Vyāsa’s account, why does Sañjaya distort the facts & make it appear to be the case that Arjuna, who was pounded to a lifeless pulp, was not weakened by Bhagavān Śrīkaṇṭharudra?

It is also interesting to note that Dhṛtarāṣṭra completely ignores this inaccurate example & does not respond to Sañjaya with any agreement the way Sañjaya does, and enthusiastically so, with Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s earlier speech.

#### Final battle
Now, let’s see what Sañjaya says during his live coverage of the final battle between Arjuna & Karṇa, with respect to the Kirīṭa of Arjuna, that was eventually broken by the great Nāga, Aśvasena, who hid himself in Karṇa’s arrow.

> हराम्बुपाखण्डलवित्तगोप्तृभिः;  
> पिनाकपाशाशनिसायकोत्तमैः |  
> सुरोत्तमैर् अप्य् अविषह्यमर्दितुं;  
> प्रसह्य नागेन जहार यद्वृषः ||१५||  
> - BORI Critical Edition

Sañjaya says that Arjuna’s Kirīṭa was irresistible & indestructible for even Hara, Ambupa (Lord of the Waters i.e. Varuṇa) & Ākhaṇḍala-vitta-goptṛ (Guardian of Ākhaṇḍala’s/Indra’s wealth i.e. Kubera) & their [respective] pināka, noose/pināka & lightning weapons. And Arjuna’s crown could not be crushed by even the highest among the celestials but Vṛṣa (Karṇa) broke it with his serpentine arrow. Seems utterly preposterous to suggest that something that Hara cannot break was broken by Karṇa with the help of a Nāga.

#### Moha
So, Sañjaya gives a completely inaccurate testimony in one case & makes a ridiculous claim in the other. In both cases, Sañjaya’s statements serve to undermine Bhagavān Śrīkaṇṭharudra. This is because of Moha/delusion on account of Sañjaya’s being taken in by a Paśumata. How?

We go to the Udyogaparva. Dhṛtarāṣṭra asks Sañjaya how he came to know Mādhava/Kṛṣṇa as the great lord of all the worlds & why he is not able to know the same. (Original here (Kumbhakoṇa): Ganguli’s translation:)

Sañjaya begins his reply by stating that Dhṛtarāṣṭra has no Vidyā/knowledge while his own Vidyā does not wane. And further that one in tamas/darkness & without this Vidyā cannot know Viṣṇu & that he (Sañjaya) knows Madhusūdana/Viṣṇu/Vāsudeva as the uncreated creator.

And towards the end of the Adhyāya, Sañjaya provides a fair summary of his beliefs. There is a great emphasis on Indriyadhāraṇa (restraint of senses). Sañjaya even says that learned Vipras know such restraint of senses as Jñāna itself.

Sañjaya finally concludes by saying that such a person, who has conquered his senses, is one who delights in being subject to a state of yoga that comes from the study of scriptures. (Āgamādhigamād yogād vaśī tattve prasīdati). 

Now, what does any of this have to do with Sañjaya’s statements with respect to Bhagavān Śrīkaṇṭharudra? Quite a lot actually. This is the Siddhānta-Śaiva hierarchical scheme of the 36 Tattvas. Yoga of non-Śaiva texts leads to any of the 8 worlds for Yogins in Guṇatattva, within Prakṛti-tattva, as its highest possible result. One such world is Vaiṣṇava-Bhuvana, a preferred end of likes of Sañjaya. Perfection in restraint of senses leads to a state called Kaivalya, which is an isolation of one’s self from desires & objects of desires. 

But Siddhānta-Śaivas will point to the Rāgātattva that is higher than even Puruṣa & Prakṛti tattvas. Rāgātattva is the Tattva that facilitates attraction & aversion towards an “other”. You can get to a high state with perfect sense-restraint & develop great indifference towards worldly objects at Prakṛti/Guṇatattva levels & then attain Kaivalya at Puruṣatattva level but but there is still a Rāgātattva above. And one may not be able to overcome that aversion towards Pati (Paramaśiva) & His empowered agents such as Śrīkaṇṭharudra.

The Śaiva Śāstras explain how mala, the primordial impurity that obscures a soul’s true nature, enables Rāgā to function & works with Kalā, Rāgā & other such tattvas (in purple) to create delusion (moha) & error (bhrama). This moha is greatly helped in Sañjaya’s case by his taking refuge in a Paśumata which recognizes Viṣṇu & not Śiva, as Pati.

This is why Sañjaya has delusions about Śrīkaṇṭharudra’s greatness, even though he is the son of a Ṛṣi & a spiritually advanced soul. Such delusions are especially bad because they pull one away from Śiva even further. As Śiva is the only one truly beyond Mala, He & His empowered agents such as Śrīkaṇṭharudra alone can protect a soul from such delusions.

So, Sañjaya is very confident about his knowledge gained from Paśu-Śāstras & appears to imply his own sense-restraint & his being free from tamas (darkness). But Paśuśāstras (scriptures given to, and often given by & often centered around, Paśus) will only help cement deluded views one has of Śiva/Śrīkaṇṭharudra. The Jñāna gained from it will always bear flaws & will never be truly reliable.

Therefore, one must seek refuge in Śiva & Siddhānta-Śaivam & have devotion to Paramaśiva’s empowered agents in order to obtain Jñāna that is truly reliable.

## Paratvam
Supremacy. Bhāgavata/Viṣṇu purāṇas teach Viṣṇu/Kṛṣṇa paratvam. Earlier parts of Śivapurāṇa teach paratvam of the Śrīkaṇṭha who lords over Puruṣatattva while “operating” at Guṇatattva (different from the Śrīkaṇṭharudra I keep referring to in my threads). he last book of Śivapurāṇa (Vāyavīya Sam̐hitā) & Siddhāntāgamas teach paratvam of Paramaśiva, who is nothing but pure consciousness that has never been obscured by mala.

## श्रीकण्ठ-रुद्र
The "शिव"
- who features in the classical लीला-s (the
  देवासुर संग्राम-s)
- who is *generally* the highest "शिव" taught in अ-शैव पुराण-s
- who is the popular & lay understanding of who *शिव* is

He is श्रीकण्ठ-रुद्र who, as per the सिद्धान्तागम-s:

- resides in रुद्रलोक at the very top of our ब्रह्माण्ड (which contains all our physical & non-physical worlds such as our earth, the rest of the universe, स्वर्ग, नरक, पाताल, इत्यादि; & is located in पृथिवी - तत्त्व)
- is the गुरु of all beings in this ब्रह्माण्ड; &
- occasionally manifests at barer on earth.

## श्रीकण्ठ
The “शिव” 

- who is the highest "शिव" generally taught in the संहिता-s of शिवपुराण apart from the final वायवीय-संहिता
- who is often identified with पुरुष & associated with योगी-s in those संहिता -s (उमा-संहिता,
  युद्ध-संहिता, etc)
- whose realm is said to be above that of ब्रह्मा, विष्णु, कुमार & उमा in these संहिता-s

He is श्रीकण्ठ, who, as per the सिद्धान्तागम-s:

- Is the lord of पुरुष-तत्त्व
- "operates" in गुण तत्त्व in the midst of advanced योगी-s
- Lords over the octad of worlds, the योगाष्टक- भुवन-s, in गुण-तत्त्व, which includes कण्ठ, औम, कौमार, वैष्णव & ब्राह्म भुवन -s (you can see the correspondence between what the पुराण & आगम say).

## परमशिव
The शिव

- who is the Supreme शिव taught in the वायवीय- संहिता of शिवपुराण
- who is taught to be beyond all the 36 T-s - who is beyond all name & form & is the Supreme Sovereign that acts through His agents
- who is expressly taught to be the end-goal of the सिद्धान्तागम-s

He is परमशिव of the सिद्धान्त,  
who has no form but allows us to visualize Him in certain forms for the sake of ध्यान इत्यादि &  
who blesses advanced souls like the earlier-mentioned two "शिव-s" to have subtle bodies with the same forms He assumes only in ध्यान .

Understanding these different "शिव-s" can help one navigate through contradictions between पशु-शास्त्र -s & पति-शास्त्र-s & all those in between.

Śaiva distinguish between Śrīkaṇṭha-Rudra (the Śiva of popular lore) & Paramaśiva, who is literally called “Śānta”.

The bigger issue I have with your tweet is the lack of distinction between a human expression of anger & divine “anger”.

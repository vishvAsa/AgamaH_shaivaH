A common misconception many Hindus have about the Siddhānta, including many Śaiva-s, is that the Siddhānta is centered on the supremacy of a "particular deity". Yes, Siddhānta upholds Śiva-paratvam but what exactly is Śiva-paratvam?

In the Siddhánta, every Ātmā (sentient) is Cidghana (a pure mass of consciousness) whose inseparable Cicchakti consists of knowledge & power. This Cicchakti is obscured by a primordial impurity called mala for all sentients except one, who is eternally unlimited & pure & beyond name & form. This particular Ātmā is eternally free from all connections with insentients, which is what names & forms are. For convenience & our own edification, we call this Ātmā “Īśvara”, “Paramaśiva” or “Śiva”.

What about the forms associated with this Īśvara? We meditate upon Śiva with matted locks of hair, weapons in hands, snakes on the body & so on. We sculpt icons of Śiva with these features. These are for the purposes of visualization & worship. But why these specific features? The Śaiva answer is that these forms are the forms of bodies actuslly possessed by deities we call Śaiva or Raudra. Śrīkaṇṭharudra who inhabits Kailāsa & often hears the complaints of Devas - He is distinct from Paramaśiva but he is very exalted, due to his spiritual perfection & maturity (Malapakva). He is one of the prime examples of Rudras whose forms are “borrowed” by Paramaśiva for our worship. 

In other words, though without any qualifiers, Paramaśiva, that mass of pure consciousness beyond name & form, graciously allows us to qualify Him with the actual names & forms of slightly lesser albeit exalted beings, owing to their extraordinary purity. An elaboration of this point is given by Siddhānta-Pūrvācārya Śrī-Sarvātmaśaṃbhu (Siddhānta-Prakāśikā of Sarvātma-śambhu.).

We call It/Him Paramaśiva (together with inseparable Parāśakti) because the Śaiva sages found it apt to describe this inseparable (like a thing & its essence) pair as male & female. Paramaśiva is a unique individual but remains eternally unqualified by any form, name or paraphernalia. Paramaśiva is not male & Parāśakti is not a distinct entity or female.

What you see as typical Śaiva imagery & paraphernalia (a body, let alone even more specifities such as matted hair, poison in neck, serpents on body, trident, etc) - None of this is essential to Paramaśiva/Parāśakti at all. So, what are they?

These specificities are concessions, to our needs, which are made possible through the existence of superior classes of beings (Śrīkaṇṭharudra & other Rudras) for whom these features are part & parcel of their exceedingly subtle, non-physical but ultimately material (made of pure or impure Māyā) bodies.

Some like Śrīkaṇṭharudra were so blessed that Paramaśiva chose to “borrow” the forms of their bodies (not limited to a single form since a Deva like Śrīkaṇṭharudra can take multiple forms) & paraphernalia for Siddhāntīs in their visualization & worship of Paramaśiva.

## Contrast with advaita
One may argue that even in “non-sectarian” systems, the relationship between the Supreme One & the 5/6 forms is much “tighter” than that between the Supreme One & the Śaiva forms in Siddhānta. In other words, those 5/6 forms are far more fundamental/intrinsic to the nature of Brahman than what the Śaiva forms are to Paramaśiva.

Siddhānta-Śaivam is actually far less centered around a specific deity than other Sampradāyas, including Kevalādvaita, because the specific Saguṇa/Sakala forms associated with ultimate Paramaśiva are extrinsic to It while their equivalents in other systems are intrinsic to the ultimate Brahman.

In Kevalādvaita, whether it’s a single form such as Viṣṇu (as is implied in the earliest works)+++(5)+++, or ratnatraya (Śiva-Viṣṇu-Śakti’s equal parabrahmatvam as Appayya Dīkṣitendra advances), or pañcāyatana or Ṣaṇmata formulations, the 1/3/5/6 forms are not borrowed from non-ultimate beings. So, the Advaitin cannot avail of the Śaiva Siddhāntī’s argument.

In all of those formulations, even if you said Brahman alone appears as all, including as subordinate deities such as Indra & others, there is the idea that there is something about the 1/3/5/6 entities, which makes them intrinsic to the very nature of Nirguṇa Brahman.

In fact, it’s precisely because you say that Brahman appears as ALL souls & things, you have to admit something special about that 1/3/5/6, which makes them more intrinsic to the very nature of Brahman than all of its other “appearances”.

In contrast, the Siddhānta teaches that the ultimate Paramaśiva “borrows” the forms for the purposes of its visualization by Its Sādhakas/Upāsakas from non-ultimate beings, which are distinct from it.

Therefore, Niṣkala-Paramaśiva is far less centered around a specific deity than the Nirguṇa-Brahman of Kevalādvaita.

The contrast is even clearer with other systems, which are very clear about their claims that the Paratvam is vested in a specific deity who eternally possesses an inseparable repository of certain, distinct forms.

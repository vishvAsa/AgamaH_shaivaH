## dharma
In the Śaiva context, your Dharma is Śivatvam (Śiva-Ness). To be omniscient, omnipresent & omnipotent is your true nature & therefore your Dharma. Again, Dharma here is not something you do but something you are.

## karma
Karmas get done through the bodies, instruments, world & objects (tanu-karaṇa-bhuvana-bhoga) supplied by Māyā. The fruits of Karma are also consumed by means of tanu-karaṇetyādi. As Karman is gradually burnt off by experience (whether happiness or suffering), your Karman attains pakvam (maturation) & that *individual Śakti of mala* acting on *your* particular soul, in conjunction with *your* Karman, will also get pakvatvam.

## mala-pAka
When that individual power of mala, that is acting on *your* particular soul, has reached its maximum potential, it starts to ripen & gradually slows down in its functioning & approaches a halt. This is when Śaktipāta (Descent of Śiva’s power) starts taking place.

 While I have compared malaśakti to a battery with a “finite” number of charging cycles, it has to be noted that the progress of an individual’s malaśakti is not exactly quantitative; nor is it a function of time. Each soul’s malaśakti has a qualitative, intrinsic nature, which becomes irreversibly ripened with the right series of experiences particular to *that* individual malaśakti.

A weird if partially insightful analogy would be as follows:

Imagine your own malaśakti’s current pakvatva state to be a function of all the experiences accrued over the infinite past chain of births. Imagine the malaśakti’s state to be like the sum of a divergent series. Moving forward from the current state, imagine exerting one’s free will such that one shapes up a convergent series in the forward direction with an “opposite” sum, to zero & close out this malaśakti’s operation forever. 

Now, this necessary convergent series (the optimal future series of births from the present that is necessary for maturation of the malaśakti) takes on a unique form for each soul i.e. in the form of particular births with specific experiences. This is the qualitative aspect of malaparipāka (maturation of mala). 

### Maturation points
That this trajectory varies for each soul is beautifully hinted at in the Vāyavīya Saṁhitā of the Śivamahāpurāṇa, which is the final book of the Purāṇa and the one which expounds the Siddhānta. How so? See these beautiful ślokas by Brahmā in the Vāyavīya, before he directs some Ṛṣayaḥ to Vāyu to get more answers.

However, the subsequent ślokas from 41 to 45 give examples of non-classical trajectories where the soul attains perfection. The soul may be liberated (i.e. malaparipāka; Brahmā does not directly refer to mala here, but Vāyu later explains the Siddhānta mysteries of Mala & other doctrines) at various points.

- In the womb: garbhastho mucyate
- While being born or having been born: jāyamānas tathāparaḥ
- As a child, youth or as an old man, a soul may be liberated: bālo vā taruṇo vātha vṛddho vā mucyate paraḥ
- As an animal, the soul may be liberated: tiryagyonigataḥ kaścinmucyate
- As a denizen of hell even, one may be liberated: nārako 'paraḥ
- Right after the termination of one’s otherworldly tenure in heaven or some other loka, some may be liberated: aparastu padaṃ prāpto mucyate svapadakṣaye
- Or some may fall from the otherworldly state back into this realm & then obtain mukti: kaścitkṣīṇapado bhūtvā punarāvartya mucyate
- Some may get mukti while being situated in the transit between worlds! - kaścidadhvagatastasmin sthitvāsthitvā vimucyate

Every soul, whether on a good or bad path in line with its individual karmapravāha, ***if it does not adopt vaidikadharma in order to prepare itself for eventual Śaiva-Dīkșā***, risks facing a long & indeterminate series of births ahead of it, culminating in malaparipāka, resulting in paramukti.

This series differs for each soul qualitatively and different souls may require wildly different combinations of experiences before its mala ripens or at least begins to ripen.

Therefore, an evil soul may have to be flung into evil yonīs for myriads of births and go through asura, piśāca or evil human births. It may be one, two or three of such births. Or it may be hundreds, thousands or even koțis of such births before it experiences malapakva and shortly goes on to manifest malaparipāka (full ripening) and attain Paramukti (union with Śiva).

For other souls, after a few such births, it may develop devotion to Vaidikam, which propels it towards Śaivadīkșā as stated above.


### Effort
The classical trajectory is highlighted in Ślokas 33 to 40, where a soul, due to a bit of grace, practices Dharma as propounded in Veda & gradually comes to have Bhakti for Śiva, which eventually (over lifetimes) leads to getting Śaiva initiation from a Guru.

But can we avoid a long “convergent series” ahead of us & avoid waiting for that final experience where malapakva will culminate? Can we do something? 

Yes & that leads to the answer for the 4th question about free-will.

As you can see from the ślokas above, Vaidika/Laukika Dharma helps us overcome the indefiniteness of the series of births ahead of us. It helps streamline this uncertain future into a “doable” convergent series of births. It reduces sins & kick-starts the malapaka process, when done properly. It helps engender devotion to Paramaśiva in one’s heart. 

However, that dharma by itself is not sufficient to grant mukti. One still needs Īśvaraprasāda (Grace). However, Vaidika Dharma is our best means available to sow the seeds for the phase of anugraha that transforms malaśakti & begins to manifest our true nature. 

In due time, when the soul is eventually ready for Saiddhāntika-Dīkṣā, that “necessary” convergent series is experienced & exhausted during the initiation itself, by the power of mantras, with the exception of prārabdha karma that has to be experienced in the body one already has.+++(5)+++ 

## anugraha
What is the definition of anugraha in Siddhānta? It is causing a Dharmī to manifest its Dharma, causing an existent to manifest its innate nature, whether sentient or insentient. 

In the Siddhānta understanding, Śiva’s anugraha is eternally present for all existent s, BOTH sentient & insentient. 

## anugraha on mala & karman
All this while, mala & karma have been jumping the queue & getting the anugraha ahead of you. But this is not a bad thing.

When the insentients, Mala & Karman, beat the soul on the queue & get Śivānugraha, they work robustly at performing their functions which are respectively, to obscure your powers & make you go through experiences. 

This may sound bad. But it isn’t. Why? Remember that as with all insentient things, there is a limited “lifespan” for their operation before it starts decaying. And that’s what the expedited operation of Mala & Karman does. They get worn out , making way for your soul to receive “unfiltered anugraha.”

## Longing
That direct reception of Śivaśakti is what we call anugraha (grace). When that happens, you start thinking about Śiva & start longing for an Ācārya to get the Śaiva initiation.

## Paramashiva role

The value of Paramaśiva/Īśvara being the one who causes the Dharmī (an existent possessor of innate nature) to manifest its Dharma is two-fold. 

### Setting pAsha-s in motion
a. The pāśas (mala, karma & māyā) & paśus (bound sentients) are insentient & need an Īśvara (Paramaśiva) to re-activate (at the start of every new sṛṣṭi) & de-activate (at mahāpralaya) to give rest to both the insentients & bound sentients. 

Yes, the pāśas have an innate nature to obscure the powers of knowledge & action (mala), subject a paśu to pleasure & pain (karma) & equip a paśu with the means to undergo said experience (māyā, the raw material for bodies, sensory faculties, worlds & the objects in these worlds). But innate nature by itself does not accomplish anything. 

For example, a ball’s innate nature is to roll down a slope if pushed beyond the edge but without that push, the ball is not going to roll by itself. Now, one may say, “a gust of wind or some sudden shaking in the floor may agitate the ball and/or inclined plane & cause the ball to roll down the sloped surface. There is no need for a sentient”. While this may be true in an example like this, during the Mahāpralaya period, when even time & space (which are evolutes of Aśuddhamāyā) are absent, it is impossible to imagine exceedingly subtle insentients such as Mala, Karma & Māyā burst forth into this grossly physical set-up we have now, without the “push” by a sentient entity. 

### anugraha
b. The knowledge from Śāstra is that the Supreme Paramaśiva is verily the all-pervasive grace, who not only shares with us in terms of essential nature (pure consciousness) but by His very nature (not due to deliberation) spontaneously causes all existents to manifest their innate nature. 

To reiterate what was stated in my response to No.1 above, Paramaśiva’s anugraha/ājñā (both are the same thing & just synonyms for Parāśakti) is not due to deliberation but spontaneous, arising by virtue of His very nature.

This being the case, why is our innate nature not manifesting automatically due to His grace? Why are we not liberated right now? 

This is because He impartially graces both insentients & sentients alike & our trajectory towards that self-realisation (manifestation of our nature as pure Cit/consciousness) is intertwined with the trajectories of our personalised insentient package (the individual malaśakti beginninglessly binding each of us, our uniquely individual stream of karma & the particular māyeyas each of us have—physical body, puryaṣṭaka-deha, etc).

In other words, while we are being graced all the time, so are our insentient “packages”. So, the path to self-realisation becomes painfully slow. We are experiencing grace as filtered by these pāśas. So the cycle of suffering & limited pleasure continues. 

Understanding the existence of such an Īśvara motivates us to find the quickest way out i.e. to push towards completion the insentients in front of us in the queue for anugraha so that we can experience anugraha purely & subsequently the manifestation of our true nature. 

That way is Dīkṣā (initiation), which is considered Parāśakti Herself. 

The value of the idea of Īśvara being the one who eternally causes all existents to manifest their innate nature lies in its soteriological utility. Without this, the idea that all existents eventually operate in accordance with their innate nature is a dry & merely descriptive one, with no potential to help or transform us.

Barring muktas, we are all dependent on Paramaśiva’s command (Ājñā) to run our course.

Barring muktas, we are all dependent on Paramaśiva’s command (Ājñā) to run our course. For sentients, the end-goal is the full & irreversible manifestation of our Cicchakti-s (our individual powers of consciousness) which manifest as Dṛk (power of knowledge) & Kriyā (power of action) Śaktis. At this point, the soul becomes a Paramukta & is no longer dependent on Paramaśiva.

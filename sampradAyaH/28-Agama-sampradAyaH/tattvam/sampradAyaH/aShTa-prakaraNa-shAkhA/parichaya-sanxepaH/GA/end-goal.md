## States
In Siddhanta, every Atma is fully pervasive like Śiva while the current non-pervasiveness any of us experiences is due to the insentient impurity called Mala.

The nature itself, be it if any sentient or insentient, is not “determined” by Paramaśiva. It simply is. The nature of every sentient is Śivatvam, by definition.

## Goal
For sentients, the end-goal is the full & irreversible manifestation of our Cicchakti-s (our individual powers of consciousness) which manifest as Dṛk (power of knowledge) & Kriyā (power of action) Śaktis. At this point, the soul becomes a Paramukta & is no longer dependent on Paramaśiva.

When we are fully freed from the hold of Mala, Karma & Māyā (which is the raw material for our bodies & faculties), we realize the omniscience, omnipotence & omnipresence we have always had. If we are each an infinite Cidghana unit like Śiva, what is there to speak of Śiva containing us or us containing Him? The moment one realizes this (after being freed from the fetters), that Mukta realizes that he or she is eternally the Cidghana being, one with the Cidghana that was never bound by the fetters +++(in service)+++.  

The nature itself, be it if any sentient or insentient, is not “determined” by Paramaśiva. It simply is. The nature of every sentient is Śivatvam, by definition.

In the state of Śivasāmya, which is the Paramukti taught in the Siddhānta, one realizes that all the particular words used for different types of mukti in other schools (Sālokya, Sāmīpya, Sārūpya, Sārșți, Sāyūjya & Kaivalya) become simultaneously applicable & find a semantic unity in Śivasāmya. 

Sālokya: Residence in the same world as the Deva: How does this play out in Śivasāmya? There is no particular loka for Paramaśiva or Paramuktas, who are both Sarvavyāpī. Everywhere Paramaśiva pervades, the Śivsāmya-Mukta’s innate pervasiveness is equally manifest there. Therefore, they both abide in the same loka, which is everywhere. This is the Sālokyatā of being Śivasāmya.

Sāmīpya: Proximity to the Deva: Can one speak of proximity between two souls whose omnipresence is fully manifest—Paramaśiva & the Śivasāmya-Mukta (Paramukta)? However, what is the essence of Sāmīpya? It is the ability to perceive the Devata. The Paramukta, by virtue of his all-pervasiveness, has uninterrupted knowledge of Paramaśiva & His activities. In this sense, it is always near. In Śivasāmya, the Paramukta never loses his individuality; not even an iota of it. Therefore, it remains an eternally distinct witness of Paramaśiva, knowing Him all the time. Proximity here goes beyond nearness in terms of physical space, a concept that doesn’t exist for all-pervasive entities. To be proximate, at its simplest & deepest level, is to be oneself & have uninterrupted cognition of another. Proximity in Śivasāmya is achieved through a combination of absolute omniscience and the retention of individuality. This is the Sāmīpyatā of being Śivasāmya.

Sārūpya: Having the same form as the Deva: In the Siddhānta, each soul’s innate nature is nothing but a pure unit of Cit (Cidghana). Cit is not an object. It has no materiality. It is beyond all forms. Paramaśiva’s and the Paramuktas’ Cidghanas are unobscured by mala (the primordial impurity that causes the Cicchakti of bound souls to remain unmanifest since eternity). In Śivasāmya, even though there is no Rūpa in the ordinary sense, every soul has its innate nature, which functions as a ‘form’. This shared Nirmala-Cidghanatvam of Paramaśiva and the Paramuktas is the likeness of form. This is the Sārūpyatā of being Śivasāmya. 

Sārșți: Likeness of glory and power: With the Cicchakti being no longer obscured by mala, the soul’s Cicchakti is fully manifest. Like Paramaśiva, the Paramukta is omnipresent, omniscient & omnipotent. This is the Sārșțitvam of Śivasāmya. 

Sāyujya: Complete oneness: In Śivasāmya, the Paramukta realizes its innate nature, its own, eternal Śivatvam. How else can one describe the relationship between two infinite, all-pervasive entities? It’s like water in water. Complete union with no gap or difference that can be cognized. All one can say is that “This Paramaśiva is. And so is the Paramukta”. The distinct individualities are retained at such a pure & simple level that a third party cannot say anything beyond this. There are no insentients such as bodies, location (“Paramaśiva is the one with this body; the Paramukta is over there”) to latch onto. This is the Sāyujyatā of being Śivasāmya. This complete disassociation with insentients leads us to the final point.

Kaivalya: Isolation/Transcendence. Kevalītvam: the state of being purely/only something: In Śivasāmya, the Paramukta is freed from association with all insentients. Paramaśiva has been eternally free from such association. Many schools define Kaivalyam differently, with some teaching (up to) disassociation from Prakṛti & others,
 teaching disassociation from yet higher Tattvas. But in Śivasāmya, Paramaśiva & Paramuktas are fully beyond all insentients. They are not qualified or delimited by Māyā-Bindu (the raw material for the pure and impure planes), Karman & Mala. This is the Kaivalyatā of being Śivasāmya. 

Thus, all definitions of mukti culminate in this Śivasāmya, which Ācārya Nārāyaņakaņțha calls the state without equal.

Śiva Śiva

## View as worship
It is an eternal offering of the Cit in the Cit & we realize that we are performing that highest & purest form of worship. Every soul realizes its independence in mukti. There is no “kainkarya per se” in paramukti. In Siddhānta, the Mukta has no “Lord”. However, **as I view it**, realising one’s Śivatvam & sameness to+++(~~unity with~~)+++ Śiva is itself that purest & highest worship.


## jIvanmukti
Jīvanmukti has nothing to do with preservation of body. It is the attainment of the state of Mukti while still being in the body. If Mukti is defined in this context as freedom from desires & other fluctuations of the mind, then yes, one may say that Siddhānta too holds that to be possible. 

However, be it Kevalādvaita or Siddhānta, the body is always under the effect of Prārabdhakarma and will have to disintegrate one day. 

Body is a Aśuddha-Māyeya (that which is made of Aśuddhamāyā). The body lasts only because of Karma & Karma can operate on even a highly advanced soul because of residual malaśakti. If that malaśakti irreversibly degenerates into a state of non-operation, there will no longer be place for Karma or Māyā to operate.

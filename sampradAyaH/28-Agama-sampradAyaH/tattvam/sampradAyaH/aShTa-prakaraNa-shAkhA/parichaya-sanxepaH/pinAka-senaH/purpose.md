1. To unbind the true nature of yourself, that is to free yourself of the binding fetters (pāśa) which cloud your caitanya
2. This Jagat is the means to cause the mala to ripen and your karma to be exhausted.
3. Bhagavān does not create sentients, they have always existed. 

Now the question would be why would Īśvara desire to do this, as He is beyond such desires. Correct. He is beyond desire, His anugraha which pours out - not due to desire - but volition naturally causes the different Tattvas to realise their potential.

> Why were asuras, danavas and daityas created and why do they have evil nature? Do they serve a function in the universe?

It is a natural consequence of the effect of mala and their karma which causes the soul to inhabit such bodies. In a way their birth in such a way is a blessing too, because the effect of mala on them is so intense that their “cruel” eradication by deities causes their karma to burn up. 

Another deeper interpretation is that these various asurādayaH are in fact the various malaśakti-s which bind the soul and cause the obscuration of its innate caitanya. Now Mala is singular but it has infinite potency which affect all souls except Īśvara who was never affected and the muktas who will never be affected after mukti. So we can also see a deeper meaning where Īśvara does samhāra of these beings as Him gracing us with Mokṣopāyas.

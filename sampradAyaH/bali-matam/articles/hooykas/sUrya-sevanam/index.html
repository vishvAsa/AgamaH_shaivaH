<h2 id="preface">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book has been written primarily for those interested in (Hindu) religion and ritual, and from the reviews to be written by the scholars among them, I hope to learn with which part of the Indian subcontinent and with which century of Indian history this ritual is associated. Though Indology is not my strong point, I do have a unique collection of Balinese MSS. in my possession and I feel it is desirable to publish material as soon as it has been given shape and to entrust most of the linking up to my colleagues. The last chapter has been written to stimulate them. My second aim is to encourage those who consider working on Balinese MSS., especially the MSS. in the Gedong Kirtya at Singaradja (Bali) which have not yet been described properly and which may even be insufficiently known. One cannot expect them to be faultless, but several of them are remarkably good and prove to have been copied carefully. This collection, which is, of course, not yet complete is, nevertheless, varied and rich. These MSS. can exasperate one, but they can also give one the satisfaction not only of finding what one is seeking, but other things also. They should be studied, they are valuable, even indispensable. Although, in the first place, this book is intended for the scholarly, I cannot help fostering the hope that it may reach some representatives of widely divergent groups. The first is that of Christians, for many of whom the way to God seems to present no problem - but whose churches become emptier. The second is that of the Hindus in Bali, who might be interested in having in clear print before their eyes the ritual by which their priests worship their God, and by which they prepare their Holy Water. Hitherto, as far as I know, this ritual has not been too easily accessible to them, for the greater part due to the languages in which it was written 1). I hope they will be patient where I have misunderstood 1) Just as this book was about to go to the printers, Professor Dr. J. Ensink of the University of Groningen gave me the pamphlet entitled WEDA SANGGRAHA, according to its preface called WEDA-SANGHITA. It consists of 42 pages in excellent Balinese script. It is published by the Parisada Dharma Hindu Bali (congregation of brahman priests) and was printed at Denpasar on the occasion of the huge Eka- Daśa-Rudra ceremony in the National Sanctuary, Pura Besakih, in March-April 1963. The contents are: Catur Weda, Pūjā Parikrama and Buddha Weda, and - apart from six pages of misprints-it is a faithful transliteration of Sylvain Lévi&rsquo;s book &lsquo;Sanskrit Texts from Bali&rsquo;, sections I and III, evaluated in 1.2 infra, and throughout this book (my book deals with I). In this Pūjā Parikrama, the rubric section is rather short, and since no translation of the Sanskrit is given, this pamphlet cannot yet satisfy the need for elucidation. In the &lsquo;WEDA PARIKRAMA&rsquo;, selected by Narendra Dev Pandit and translated into Indonesian by I Gusti Madé Tamba (clearly printed in Roman script, Bhuvana Sarasvati Publications, Denpasar, Bali, 1953), notwithstanding its promising title, it is only in its seventh and last section, Mantra-mantra Sanskrit dari Bali, pages 263-300, that there are any ślokas with translation. There are 35 of them, a dozen of them being relevant to the ritual dealt with in this book. No further attempt has been undertaken in this direction, as far as I know [[005]] 6 SŪRYA-SEVANA the tendency of their MSS., and that they will be co-operative and give me their criticisms. I thank them for the trust with which they confided their precious MSS. to me and also to the public library of palm leaf Mss., the Gědong Kirtya at Singaradja. SPELLING I know that even peaceful minds are prone to become overheated in the matter of the spelling of the mother tongue. In this respect, I beg for the reader&rsquo;s indulgence for the way I have resolved the difficulties with which I saw myself confronted. In Indological works &lsquo;Veda&rsquo; is the usual spelling for the word which in Indonesia is spelt &lsquo;Weda&rsquo;, and, with the exception of the preceding note, I have clung to the v spelling. But then some of my MSS not only alternate &lsquo;Varuna&rsquo; with &lsquo;Baruna&rsquo;, but also may vary the correct &lsquo;bodhana&rsquo; with the &lsquo;hypercorrect&rsquo; (i.e. mistaken) &lsquo;vodhana&rsquo;. As it is not worth while stating all the divergencies of spelling in the writings of a society where a spelling system is a twentieth century innovation, and this only with regard to the Roman script, I have, as a rule, been systematizing and &lsquo;Sanskritizing&rsquo;, even in Old-Javanese and Balinese. The use of too many capitals makes printed pages look ugly, but I could not avoid using them frequently. Constantly dealing with holy subjects as I am, usage, apart from necessity, is my justification for doing so. In Dutch, when writing of God, it is customary to use capitals in &lsquo;God Who&rsquo; and &lsquo;God Whose&rsquo; and &lsquo;His Only Son&rsquo;. Indonesians, mainly during this century, have been educated along Dutch lines, and so one may find in Indonesian &lsquo;Putera-Nja jang Esa&rsquo;. Narendra Dev Pandit in his &lsquo;Weda Parikrama&rsquo; prints &lsquo;hamba-Mu&rsquo;, &lsquo;Your servant&rsquo;. In the Roman Catholic &lsquo;Pengadjah Sang Kristus&rsquo;, a cathechism in Roman script but without mention of publisher, place or date (provided with an imprimatur dated 2-10-&lsquo;57), all holy persons, holy ideas and even &lsquo;Gěni Něraka&rsquo; have a capital initial letter; such words may even be printed entirely in capitals. The other day French Protestants and Roman Catholics agreed on printing &lsquo;Mal&rsquo; in the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer. In Bali, Protestant missionary books are only printed in the indigenous script, as far as I know. Presumably because the Devanagari script has no capitals, there is a strong tendency among Sanskritists, in transliteration, to deny themselves these useful auxiliaries. Finding myself between the devil and the deep sea, I have used capitals for the essential words of a caption, but initial capitals only for all holy persons and for personifications. In this way I have endeavoured to be fair to Believers, to those who like subdivisions, and to those who have an eye for layout. For the benefit of the last category, and also to avoid a surfeit of capitals, &lsquo;MSS&rsquo; will be written &lsquo;mss&rsquo; throughout. I have used circumflexes and hyphens freely in the transliteration of Sanskrit, as an aid to lucidity. Moreover, in the hope of being helpful [[006]] PREFACE 7 to those Sanskritists who may be ignorant of Indonesian languages, I have also put a hyphen between a Sanskrit word and its Indonesian accretion. Italics have been used for non-English words, and in order to draw extra attention to the small but important words IDEP/DHYANA, which precede an explanation to the worshipper as an instruction to him to THINK, I have used capitals. I have also sometimes spaced a word or words, with the same idea. Often I had to make my own choice between using a comma or a semi- colon and a semi-colon or a full stop; I may not have been consistent but then neither were my mss. Dashes are mine; they are not found in the mss. It is inevitable that this book will, by its very nature, demand the reader&rsquo;s concentration, and so, from the outset, I have tried to present it in a readable and surveyable manner.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgments">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>
<p>I am indebted to Dr. T. Goudriaan of the University of Utrecht who drew my attention to the existence of Fausta Nowotny&rsquo;s paper, and to Professor Dr. J. Ensink of the University of Groningen who gave me a copy of the Weda Sanggraha and who went through a considerable part of my ms. With his better knowledge of Sanskrit and Indology generally speaking, he was able to give me much help. This work has fewer flaws as a result of the aid this scholar has continually given me. I wish to thank Miss Jeune Scott-Kemball, known for her faithful and elegant translations who, without hesitation, took upon herself the un- enviable task of correcting my English and making my meaning clear; not only is the author but any reader should be grateful to her. I must also thank Miss Winifred T. Large of the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, who arranged for the photographs of the new drawings to be made, and Mr. A. M. Verheggen of the Royal Academy, Amsterdam, for the photographs from &lsquo;Mudrās&rsquo; by Tyra de Kleen, which thanks to the courtesy of Messrs. Kegan Paul of London the publisher was permitted to reproduce. This book could not have been written without the never failing help of my friend I Gusti Ngurah Ketut Sangka of Krambitan (Tabanan, Bali), who provided me with not only my best ms but also with the meticulous drawings he had made of mudrā. Writing to me about his numerous consultations with padandas and collecting all the material, which he put at my disposal for the furtherance of the understanding of his religion, must have taken him much time; I owe him my deepest gratitude.

<h2 id="i-introduction">I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<ol>
<li>THE TITLE AND ITS LIMITATION Some explanation is required here; the first is the term &lsquo;Balinese&rsquo;. Balinese princes from Karangasem, the most eastern part of Bali, ruled over Lombok, the adjacent island to the east, between 1744-1894. They built their capital Cakra-nagara in the most western part of that island. There a Balinese court flourished with its brahman priests and their learning. It was there that the Nāgara-kṛtāgama, the most epoch making ms of the Hindu-Javanese past, was found.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, when in this book, a ms originating from Lombok is mentioned, it belongs to this Balinese world. With the exception of some seventeen brahman Buddha priests, padanda Buddha as they are called, all Balinese padanda are considered to be priests of Śiva. This book deals with the brahman padanda Śiva, in some treatises called &lsquo;high priest&rsquo;, and not with the pamanku, temple or village priest, who are more numerous and whose mediatory activities are, in the main, directed towards other deities and who as a rule do not belong to the trivansa (upper three castes: brāhmaṇa-ksatriya-vaiśya) but are outside of them (jaba; a class of out castes is unknown in Balinese Hinduism).</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Way to God&rsquo; is an imperfect term for the detailed rendering of a ritual, the first half of which, indeed, consists of all the preparations to make it possible for the priest&rsquo;s soul to achieve unity with God, but the second half of which, the preparation of Holy Water by God, Who directs the priest&rsquo;s hands (kara, i.e. do-er), may be the more important. The Balinese were in the habit of calling their creed, the agama tirtha, after this Holy Water, tirtha or toya or amrta (rendered by me as &lsquo;ambrosia&rsquo;, though I know that it should be &rsquo;nectar&rsquo;). Only recently has the term āgama tirtha given way to one with a more international element in it: āgama Hindu Bali. A complete ritual will be dealt with in this book, though it is only the basis and is enlarged considerably for a variety of grand occasions: from incinerations to Eka-Daśa-Rudra, but these fall outside the scope of this book. Finally by saying &lsquo;a&rsquo; and not &rsquo;the&rsquo; Balinese priest, the intention is to show that in this religion and in this island there may exist differences, in detail and perhaps even in essence. This subject is as interesting and important as the subject of this book but is not within its field. These explanations were felt to be necessary in this field of research because every visitor to Bali is immediately struck by the enormous number of temples and offering places and on the first day of his visit may learn about the great variety of gods worshipped and of the worship- [[009]] ping of different groups. He may be shown the difference between the Śaiva and the Bauddha brahman and the (slightly Vaiṣṇava) sēnguhu (exorcist) with his extra cult objects, while all three are squatting down during their ritual and can hardly be distinguished. He himself will notice that the ubiquitous pamanku, temple or village priest, who is constantly moving about, is clad in white and has a white head covering, but he will need to have some knowledge to draw the conclusion that the dalan, puppeteer of the shadow theatre, vayań kulit, may, for part of his activities, be reckoned as being an exorcist priest.</p>
<p>It is only to be expected that with this variety of places of worship, of occasions for worship and of priests worshipping, there are a considerable number of rituals to be performed. Of all these, the Balinese have only reproduced the basic ritual of the pamanku (mimeographed; available in Balinese script and in Roman script) under the title &lsquo;KUSUMA-DEVA&rsquo; (here I must repeat that the GAGELARAN PEMANKU, mimeographed, foolscap, &lsquo;dikeluarkan oléh dinas agama otonoom daérah Bali&rsquo;, Denpasar, 9-7-&lsquo;58 contains essentially the same ritual, with the addition, however, of some inserted mention of Buddha and Tri-ratna).</p>
<h3 id="2-previous-research">2. PREVIOUS RESEARCH</h3>
<p>Hitherto three attempts have been made by Europeans to penetrate into the world of the Śaiva brahman. This priest, who plays a role in all elaborate ceremonies, festivities and spectacles, but who keeps himself completely aloof, and who, after an hour of murmuring and of making gestures, during which time he concentrates exclusively on himself, of throwing flowers and rice grains, of bell ringing and gesturing with the fingers, and holding cult objects above the priests&rsquo; lamp (fire) and the smouldering frankincense, of splashing water which is in small containers and sprinkling it in drops, then returns home again, respected, sought out as one who prepares Holy Water, but not as one who is regarded as a leader nor followed or listened to as a preacher; as one who is unheeded and not understood. All these things are of no concern to him.</p>
<p>First by birth, subsequently by education and finally by initiation he becomes twice-born, dvi-jāti; by study and consecration he changes from an ulaka (Skr. valaka, balaka, child; in Bali: a theological student who has not yet been consecrated) and becomes an ordained priest who is permitted, and has the ability to, project his soul from his body, to burn his sins away, to introduce the Śiva Soul into his pure body, to have the god Śiva Himself prepare the Holy Water, to make the God return again to the celestial abode. He does not have to ask for Holy Water or to invite the God to appear-his words and works accomplish the God&rsquo;s descent and His preparing of Holy Water. This basic ritual enables the priest to take care of the dead, to consecrate the ruler for the sake of the world of Bali, jagat Bali, and to ward off calamities. Without the worship of [[010]] INTRODUCTION 11 Śiva as the God of the Sun or God Sun (Sūrya, Āditya) and its immediate result, the obtaining of Holy Water, nothing can be done. It is perfectly understandable that my predecessors should start the study of Balinese religion by delving into the Śaiva ritual, but due to several circumstances the work has not yet been completed. In the early &rsquo;twenties, the Swedish artist Tyra (de) Kleen was attracted to the mudrā, gestures, of brahman priests and made drawings of the hand movements of Bauddha and Śaiva priests. She had the willing co- operation of the Balinese ruler of Gianjar, of Controleur P. de Kat Angelino, the Dutch Resident Magistrate, and of some padandas who were prepared to explain the meaning of several of their mudrā for which the Balinese term is pa-tañan-an, hand movements, gestures. On their information, de Kat Angelino was able to write a text to Tyra de Kleen&rsquo;s fifty drawings; he dealt mainly with the Śaiva ritual. The work was published in Dutch and translated into German, but in the Anglo-American edi- tion, a new introduction was substituted for De Kat&rsquo;s text. As De Kat&rsquo;s field of activities was elsewhere, and because he was neither a student of Sanskrit (for the priest&rsquo;s words) nor of Old-Javanese (for the priest&rsquo;s actions, the rubric), this valuable work must be regarded as pioneering. It stimulated R. Goris, who hád studied both Sanskrit and Old-Javanese, to approach the subject from the philological side when writing his Ph. D. thesis (Leiden) &lsquo;A contribution to the knowledge of Old-Javanese and Balinese theology&rsquo;. Unfortunately the Leiden mss. with which Goris had to work were too concise, written too much for the &lsquo;bon entendeur à qui demi-mot suffit&rsquo; in Bali, to admit of the construction of a ritual. His interest in the theological side of the ritual made him look towards India and the Purāṇas; in the Tantric field, the publication of books and texts had only been started. Consequently Goris&rsquo; explo- ration was not entirely succesful, but his far-reaching investigations inspired Zieseniss&rsquo; valuable work on Śaiva-Siddhānta treatises, Sanskrit and Old-Javanese (recently published by the International Academy of Indian Culture, New-Delhi). In the meantime, still in the late twenties, the famous French Indologist Sylvain Lévi visited Bali and there collected the materials for his book &lsquo;Sanskrit Texts from Bali&rsquo;. Lévi, as a leading Sanskritist, was welcomed by the colonial Government and helped as a distinguished visitor and made good use of the facilities accorded him. Day after day padandas from several self-governing provinces were given transport in order to meet and talk with him, and by reciting to them ślokas which they knew, he gained their confidence. They consulted him about their difficulties with texts and started copying them for his perusal. When the texts were published, five years later (1933), in the Gaekwad Oriental Series, Baroda, no specific details about them were given and after Lévi&rsquo;s death, and the war, they were not to be found in Paris. One is inclined to presume, without knowing it as a fact, that non-brahman scribes in a government office [[011]] 12 SŪRYA-SEVANA were used to type out for Lévi what the padandas had written in the Balinese script, being the self-evident vehicle for this subject and this language. Lévi had sometimes felt the need to emend his texts to a not inconsiderable degree-a fact apparent now that scores of the mss have come to the light. In most cases this was an improvement on the mss, though in some it was not so (specially in the stotras). Hardly anywhere in his book does he state what he has found, but then, had he done so, it might have been swollen to twice its size, without making us much the wiser. Between Lévi and his published book it may be assumed that there was in Baroda a brahman scribe, a pandita or śāstri, who trans- literated the typewritten or the emended sheets into the Deva-nāgari script, and to him I am inclined to ascribe the Old-Javanese and Balinese rubric which was not recognized as such and hence was printed in Deva- nāgari instead of in Roman script. Apart from the scribes&rsquo; errors, irritating and misleading though they are, Lévi, working with an interpreter ignorant of Balinese, has misconceived the character of both the rituals contained in his book:</p>
<p>Buddha Veda is not the daily but the death ritual of the Bauddha priest, and Veda Parikrama is not the simplest ritual of the Saiva priest. Nevertheless, Lévi was fortunate in being helped as perhaps nobody before, or since and such help he deserved; but his enthusiastic helpers who gave him the richest collection of stotras I have ever seen, also furnish- ed him with a ritual richer in points and in dislocation of sequence than any of the score of mss I have examined. It was only in the &rsquo;thirties that an abundance of good material on ritual was made available to the library of palm leaf mss, now called Gedong Kirtya, in Singaradja, mentioned by Lévi. This was due to the fact that most of the ten subdivisions of Bali and Lombok on its Board were represented by padandas, for centuries the literati. In the absence of a directing authority or the standardization that occurs through the use of textbooks, mss are the material one has to rely upon, and working with them has influenced the shape of this book. But before writing about them, three more authors who have thrown a side-light upon Balinese Saiva brahman ritual must be mentioned. To begin with Carl Gustav Diehl, in whose Instrument and Purpose; Studies on Rites and Rituals in South India&rsquo; (Gleerups, Lund, 1956) it became abundantly clear that Old-Javanese brahman ritual, as surviving in Bali, may largely be &lsquo;constructed&rsquo; from the same &lsquo;building materials&rsquo;, though it has a rather different aspect-n&rsquo;en déplaise Lévi. Most buildings have a number of building materials in common; the buildings also have the common purpose of keeping out the rain, sunshine, cold and thieves; they are subject to the law of gravitation, etc., but the purpose for which they were built are widely divergent. The structure of the Indian worship for the God-ever-present-in-the-temple shares many of its materials with that of the God-in-the-sky, Who has always to be conducted down [[012]] INTRODUCTION 13 from the sky to His worshipper for a period of some twenty minutes, Whose presence by His worshippers is felt exclusively through the Holy Water which He Himself has just prepared through His priest and which He bestows upon mankind. The purpose of this book is to try to under- stand the way in which this mystery is realized. In the second place, Fausta Nowotny, in her paper &lsquo;Das Pūjāvidhini- rūpaņa des Trimalla&rsquo; (Indo-Iranian Journal I/2, 1957, 109-54), does not refer to Diehl&rsquo;s book, which is almost contemporary with her paper, but in her introduction she mentions frequently the book on Mudrās by Tyra de Kleen and De Kat Angelino. Several of her remarks are to the point, but, due to the provisional character of her information on Bali, others are less so. The main value of her paper is its Sanskrit text, the translation and the notes. The brief ritual has certainly several points in common with the Balinese one, but it will be apparent from my book that the divergencies are also conspicuous; unavoidably prepossessed by &lsquo;my&rsquo; ritual, I am even inclined to consider it as being largely different. Finally, there is Hélène Brunner-Lachaux&rsquo;s &lsquo;Le rituel quotidien dans la tradition śivaite de l&rsquo;Inde du Sud selon Somaśambhu&rsquo;; the long title continues with &lsquo;Somaśambhupaddhati, Première Partie, [Texte], Traduc- tion, Introduction et Notes&rsquo;, being No. 25 of the Publications de l&rsquo;Institut Français d&rsquo;Indologie, Pondichéry, 1963. This rather bulky book (400 pp.), throughout more detailed than Diehl&rsquo;s, and much more so than Fausta Nowotny&rsquo;s paper, again deals with a South Indian ritual which is con- siderably closer to the Indian ones than to the Balinese Saiva ritual. From the treatises dealt with supra, Madame Brunner mentions only Diehl, but this XIth century text and her elaborate introduction are extremely helpful for the understanding of details in the Balinese ritual. As far as I can see, the two are essentially different, even though they have several subdivisions in common. To both of them apply Madame Brunner&rsquo;s words of appreciation (p. xl top): &lsquo;La voie du rituel śaiva se présente comme une voie saine et équilibrée, où les facultés de l&rsquo;être sont utilisées et dirigées, ses besoins fondamentaux satisfaits et peu à peu transformés. Elle est, nous le croyons, digne d&rsquo;intérêt et même d&rsquo;admira- tion&rsquo;. 3. WORDS SPOKEN AND MANUSCRIPTS USED Some remarks for philologists must be made about the mss; those more interested in the results than in the work which produced them need only glance through these paragraphs and absorb a few of the statements. In this field, it is only to be expected that the Balinese mss on ritual are written by those nourris dans la griya, the brahman priest&rsquo;s compound, on behalf of those who are also reared there; they try neither to convince nor to explain, they only state and describe, and more often than not very briefly. In many cases, eight, six or only four syllables are sufficient to [[013]] 14 SŪRYA-SEVANA denote a song in praise of God (cf. Te Deum); the one syllable saṁ represents the whole section of saṁkēpi (cf. sub 4 b), Lévi&rsquo;s No. 77, the printing of which takes half of his page 10, closing with the vague words mudrā saka-vēnań, &lsquo;with appropriate gestures&rsquo; (in Deva-nāgarī script). Another difficulty is, that ritual continually deals with the triad bāyu śabda-idēp: action-word-thought, of which the mantras, words, as they preponderate in these manuals, are never omitted, however concise they may be. The accompanying mudrā, however, and the taking up, flicking or casting away and dropping of a flower, and most of all the sprinkling of Holy Water, may be mentioned before the mantra or after it, or perhaps not at all. Here, one cannot be grateful enough for a slightly more circum- stantial copy. Lastly, the element IDEP or DHYANA, i.e. what the worshipper has to be aware of and what he has to imagine during the action made by his hands and by his mouth, is represented too seldom in the Balinese mss on ritual, much less so than in the South Indian paddhati, manuals (on ritual), where the author continually presents this element as the natural and not as the exceptional third. This is the reason why during the presentation of the ritualistic text, as often as possible passages are intercalated in small print. As a rule they originate from mss which did not contribute to the constituting of the text, but in some way or other dealt with these materials and threw a sidelight on them. Therefore, attention is also drawn to those passages by the use of capitals for the introductory words. Due to a variety of circumstances, both in Bali and Baroda, I only had a limited number of hours in which to consult my Śivaite informants and even then I could only go through Lévi&rsquo;s text with them. Therefore, the text presented in this book is my construction, but based on the mss. The main divisions and the subdivisions are my own, though it was the nature of the mss that suggested them to me. The fact that my faithful helper submitted my reconstituted text to the judgement of a padanda friend and that this priest made no objections to it, does not relieve me of the obligation of stating that it has been reconstituted. The mss; preceding notes. K means: originating from the Kirtya library; the numbers go from 1-2,500. L means: originating from the Library of the University of Leiden; the numbers start at about 3,000 and go to approximately 5,000; these mss have been described by Dr. H. H. Juynboll in his &lsquo;Supplement op den Catalogus van de Javaansche en Madoereesche Handschriften der Leidsche Universiteits-Bibliotheek&rsquo;, I-II, 1907-11, Brill, Leiden. As the K mss never reach a number higher than somewhere in the third thousand, and the L mss always have a number above 3,000, the K and L distinctions, once made here, hardly need to be used. In this book each ms or even constituent part of a ms is denoted by its particular capital. MSS ABGHIKR belong to my private collection and are destined eventually for the Leiden library. [[014]] INTRODUCTION 15 Mss K 69, K 87, K 1186 and L 5163 deal with more than one subject, so that their titles cover only part of their contents. From ms 69 I have used the part called S; ms 87 had to be split up into XYC; from ms 1186, I have used the middle fragment, quoted as P, and I have split ms 5163 into F and Q. I. ARGHA-PATRA, I&rsquo;. ARGHA-PATRA, I&quot;. ARGHA-PATRA, II. PARIKRAMA, The mss; six main groups. III. TOYA PAŚUCYAN/ PABRSIHAN, IV. V. VI. PŪJA/VEDA KŞATRIYA, Uttama or full ritual; basic for major ceremonies. The 4 mss which actually contain the enlargement of the priest&rsquo;s bhūṣaņa, adornments, and of Śiva- Linga worship. The other 5 mss which have not been enriched by these elaborations, for the rest, contain ex- actly the same ritual. Madhyama or restricted basic ritual, the uttama ritual minus a certain number of actions; 6 mss. dealing only with roughly the last quarter of the I ritual. My letter T-end; 2 mss only. Mss suffering from too many lacunae and dislo- cations of sequence to be used for the constituting of the course of a ritual, but because of their detail not to be despised, or useful only for the constituting of the extension dealing with the worship of Siva-Linga. Mss occasionally quoted when they happen to throw light on the text to be constituted and on its meaning. essentially belonging to the II group, but because of the Vaisnava character of their mantras better treated separately, even though they present the same sequence of activities as the purely Saiva mss. GROUP I Uttama Ritual. I-ARGHA-PATRA T-ARGHA-PATRA (Griya Kadampal, Krambitan, Tabanan), 31 typewritten sheets; the most detailed ms on this ritual hitherto examined; contains not only mudrās but also explanations and paraphrases. (Abiansěmal, Badung), K 3, lempir 1-17a, type- written copy. S-ARGHA-PATRA (Sanur, Badung), K 69&quot;, being 11. 34a-51b in KAJAN PUJA PITR (ritual for the dead), 81 lëmpir, typewritten. H-ARGHA-PATRA (Krambitan, Tabanan), 12 typewritten pages, foolscap, fine print. These 4 mss belong together, [[015]] SURYA-SEVANA not only because the words and actions are in exactly the same sequence, and because they have the same Old-Javanese rubric, but also because they share the same internal extensions on Bhūsana and worship of Śiva-Linga, and the final ritual (my S&rsquo;-Z&quot;) after the ceremonial send- off of Śiva-Surya. X-ARGHA-PATRA K-ARGHA-PATRA (origin?), K 87&rsquo;, 11. 1-12b, typewritten. This ms continues with 87&quot; (my Y) PARIKRAMA and ends with 87&quot; (my C) ASTRA-MANTRA. (Griya Anjar, Sibang Kadja, Badung), 14 type- written sheets. G-ARGHA-PATRA (&lsquo;Bonbiu, Gianjar), the first 25 pages being closely- written on paper from an exercise book, Balinese script. G stands for GAGELARAN PUJA n GEDE BHUJANGA, i.e. Exposé of the worship of the exorcist priest. Before reciting his own litany, called Pūrva Bhūmi, which belongs exclusively to his type of priests, and taking up the cult objects characteristic of his exorcistic rites - all of them preceded by the generic name bajra, thunderbolt-the sěnguhu priest worships Śiva- Sūrya and prepares Holy Water just like the Saiva priest. Hence, for the first part of his ritual, his manual is equivalent to the Saiva ritual. The nabé, teacher, of this exorcist priest was the purohita, court priest, of the ruler of Gianjar, who resided in the griya Sadawa and was the informant to Sylvain Lévi and presumably also a few years earlier of Tyra de Kleen and P. de Kat Angelino. This ms mentions repeatedly mantra and mudra that are not to be found in the preceding six mss. ARGHA-PATRA (origin?) K 83, 11. 21, Balinese script; only 11. 1b-12a deal with the ritual. My subdivisions C, Nm, P, Te, P&rsquo; are missing here; after Mb there is another Prāņāyāma (my I) intercalated. U-VEDA bvat SAURA (Kadiri, Tabanan or West Lombok), K 321, i.e. brahman ritual for the worshipper of Sūrya; written on 28 pp. of an exercise book, Balinese script, the first ten dealing with the ritual itself, the rest containing stotras. Its contents place this ms in this group. The script is not too good, the spelling is atrocious; the ms becomes sketchy once the Holy Water has been prepared (my Z). [[016]] GROUP II Mādhyama ritual. L=VEDA-PARIKRAMA (origin?), being pp. 7-32 in Lévi&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sanskrit Texts from Bali&rsquo;. None of the preceding texts has so many items out of their proper order, none of them has so many extra points of ritual and none has a cardinal section either completely out of sequence or seriously truncated or even com- pletely ignored. None, of course, has such good Sanskrit and such amputated and misspelt rubrics. P=PARIKRAMA (Singaradja, Bulèlèng), K 1186&quot;, being 11. 15a- 26b from K 1186, Pūjā Pañca Bali Krama, 38 lempir, typewritten. F=(ASTRA-MANTRA) (Lombok), L 5163′, 11. 4b-23b, very clear Ba- linese script; for obvious reasons no name and not evaluated in catalogues. V=(ASTRA-MANTRA) (Lombok), L 5141, 11. 1-12b; the Balinese script is clear enough; no name and not evaluated in catalogues. A=ASTRA-MANTRA (Bandjar Buruan, Giri Apsara,&hellip;), typewritten; followed by 1. 9a some final ritual, 11. 9b-14b other ritualia. Y=TINKAH in AGAVÉ TOYA PASOCAN (origin?), being 11. 13a-21b in K 87, Arghapātra As to their contents, these mss form a unity, clearly distinguished from the other groups. But Y shares its name with the third group. GROUP III Nişţa ritual. C=TINKAH in AGAVÉ PABRĚSIHAN (origin?), being lempir 22a-26a (finis) in K 87, Argha-patra, which in this way first deals with Uttama ritual, next with Madhyama and finally with Nista. Q=TINKAH in AGAVÉ TOYA PASUCYAN (Lombok), being lempir 24a-33b (finis) in L 5163, Astra-mantra; as in the preceding case the exposé of Madhyama ritual precedes that of the Nista. N.B. As to these mss, only two of them, and slightly diverging at that, contain the last quarter of the ritual, and do not contribute anything different; there is no reason to quote them often; they are dealt with in Appendix V. [[017]] 18 SŪRYA-SEVANA GROUP IV - Mss useful for details but less so for constituting the framework D-VEDA E-PITR-PUJĀ J-DVIJENDRA Bh-BHASMA M-KALĒPASAN of the ritual. (origin?). This ms L 4673, 76 pages foolscap in Balinese script (67 in Juynboll II 334 is a mis- print) contains several rituals, none of them complete or coherent, but its details are useful. It was one of Goris&rsquo; pillars and may have been the cause of his failing to reconstruct a complete course of the ritual. (Kěsiman, Badung), K 1423, &lsquo;Cult of the Dead&rsquo;, has its lempir 1a-10a in common with (indik ma-)Ligya, K 71, lempir 5b-13b. 11a-b deal with the ritual in the (priest&rsquo;s house) temple; so do 12a-b; 13a-b deal with the ceremonial first hair cutting of a child and purification of the soil, bhūmi-śuddha; 14a-15a again with hair cutting, 16a-17b with the worship of Śiva-linga. (Pèdjèng, Gianjar), K 189, &lsquo;Twice-born&rsquo;, 1b-28b, consists of songs in praise of the Hindu gods and contains the Śiva-linga-stava preceded by concise directions for the worship of Śiva-linga. (Blahbatu, Gianjar), K 475, &lsquo;Ashes&rsquo;, 1b-14b, derives its name from the mantras used with the application of bhasma, in its beginning; on 2b-3b deals with the worship of Śiva-Linga; 3b-4b deals with bhūṣaṇa, my Appendix I, but in a manner rather different from the other mss dealing with the subject; for the rest it deals rather succinctly with several other ritualia. (Duda, Karangasem), K 1441, &lsquo;Liberation, Res- cue&rsquo;, 64 lëmpir, in its 25a-36a contains the ritual of interest here. This ms, with its rather general title, i.a. deals with the ritual of Śiva-rātri, cf. my &lsquo;Agama Tirtha&rsquo;. These four mss help to build up the picture of the worship of Śiva-Linga. GROUP V - Somewhat Explanatory MSS. N-ARGHADHYAT- MIKA (Sanur, Badung), K 73, &lsquo;The Deeper Meaning of Argha (-pātra)&rsquo;, 1b-9b, in its four first lempir uses IDEP six times and DHYANA six times as the introductory word, &lsquo;Imagine, visualize&rsquo;, for what the worshipper has to bear in mind at several of the main points during his worship [[018]] INTRODUCTION 19 O-ANUSTHANA bvat SAURA and in doing so it sheds a valuable light on Balinese Hinduism. Most mss rarely use IDEP and do not contain DHYANA at all; it looks as if Lévi&rsquo;s ms did not have either of these words, like the majority of mss. These passages, consti- tuting so many contributions to the right under- standing of our text, have been incorporated in it, be it in small print. (Kěsiman, Badung), K 298, &lsquo;Observance for the Worshipper of Sürya&rsquo;, 1b-7b, still slightly shorter than the preceding ms, contains &lsquo;imagine&rsquo; or &lsquo;visualise&rsquo; eight times, expressed by IDEP, and nine times expressed by some derivation of /DHYA; it is therefore as important as its prede- cessor. GROUP VI VEDA KSATRIYA OF PRAGOLAN. Mss dealing with the ritual for ksatriyas and ulakas; the general course of the worship is that of the second group, but its Vaisnava substitutions and additions in the mantras are so numerous, and the internal divergencies and the deficiencies (especially in ms A) are so numerous, that they are dealt with together in Appendix 4.

Though these seven mss deal apparently with the same ritual, they are somewhat divergent in contents and sequence and hardly permit one to get a clear and final picture of the worship of noblemen, at least into the details. The mss: virtues and vicissitudes. To begin with, the mss are not only documents but also monum.nts to the careful learning by heart and the faithful handing down over many centuries. The results of close comparison of a number of mss must, in [[019]] 20 SŪRYA-SEVANA the first place, fill one with admiration for this pious devotion, the more so as analytical understanding of the Sanskrit body of the ritual had of necessity decreased considerably, whereas the garb of letters, which correspond closely with those of the Deva-nāgarī alphabet, was exactly twice that needed for expressing the ordinary Balinese language in script. Inde lacrimae. Summing up and explaining practical facts and general rules of mis- readings and odd spelling in Balinese mss, especially in connection with Sanskrit texts, has never to my knowledge been attempted hitherto, at least not in detail. It would not have been displaced in this book, but a) thanks are due to Lévi for having corrected much, and b) it will be needed much more in a planned collection of stotras, several of which are only represented in a few mss or even in a single one. Anyhow, here a warning must be repeated against Lévi&rsquo;s rash statement, that the Balinese &lsquo;do not understand one word of the Sanskrit texts which they write, read and chant&rsquo; (his p. X). What has been lost, is the ability to analyze gram- matically; for the rest the padandas, helped by their paraphrases, have a knowledge of their texts which ranges between a rough idea and 100 % understanding. 4. THREE OF THE MOST FREQUENT REPETITIONS The ritual of the Saiva priest is rich in repetitions and it might be good to deal with this subject from the outset. Some of them are only short formulas, as e.g. the Kūṭa-mantra, consisting of the few words om hrām hrim sah Parama-Śiv-Ādityāya namaḥ. The South Indian style of the paddhatis, ritual handbooks, call this the mūla-mantra, the fundamental formula, for the adoration of Śiva in His capacity as the God of the Sun or the God Sun. Unaccompanied by a mudrā it is used in my Ea 10-11, Kb 3, Mb 2, Nn 1, Q 6, E&rsquo;b, K&rsquo; 6, L&rsquo; 5, P&rsquo; &amp; T&rsquo; 7. Thrice repeated, but only one line of print, and similarly unaccompanied by a gesture, is the formula called either śrī ambha and śrī ambhavantu after its initial two words, or try-antu after the ending which is repeated thrice. The formula reads: śreyo bhavatu, sukham bhavatu, pūrṇam bhavatu, may there be good fortune, may there be fullness (or: fulfilment), may there be happiness-the words with which the pamanku, temple priest, of Batu Karu in Tabanan once welcomed my wife and me into the precincts under his care-a formula for which, after this translation, omne quod felix, faustum fortunatumque sit might be substituted. It is somewhat less frequently used, cf. my B 10, Cb 18, H 9, Mb 15, Yc 18, Zb 3, T&quot;a 8. It should be noted here that this formula, according to the closely related I &amp; K mss, is not spoken by the worshipper, but by the God Who is worshipped, Who shows His benevolence towards the worshipper. The other mss do not mention this explanation. The Sthiti formula is hardly any longer: om Sa-Ba-Ta-A-I, om na- [[020]] INTRODUCTION 21 ma-Si-vā-ya, om Am-Um-Mam, to be found in B 4, Q 7, Vc, F&rsquo; 2, Χ&quot; (Ν.Β.), (Η). The variant of this formula, and always preceding it, is Utpatti and runs as follows: om I-Ba-Ta-Sa-A, om ya-na-ma-Si-vā, om Mam-Um- Am; it occurs only in B 3, Q 3, F&rsquo;, X&quot; and (E). (Pralina, reading om A-Ta-Sa-Ba-I, om vā-Si-ma-na-yā, от Ат- Um-Mam, and the third of this kind, obviously not to be repeated, is found in my X&rsquo;a, X&quot; and Z&quot;a). Deva-pratisthā-mantra, reading om Deva-pratisthāyai namaḥ, is accom- panied by pratistha mudrā; it occurs in my Nm, Q 4, Ub and E&rsquo;a. These one line formulas need no discussion here, because they are simply short repetitions; the same applies to the much longer set of formulas, accompanied by mudrās, beginning with upahrdaya-mantra and best known as Udakāñjali, cf. my O, Vb, J&rsquo; and P&rsquo;. These parts of the ritual have been repeated, not only for the reader&rsquo;s ease, but also because, in the mss, they continually show small differences, or at least less com- pleteness in their repetition. This repetition was, moreover, unavoidable in the case of Sivi-karana Brahmānga-Śivānga, long as this set of five mantras and mudrās followed by an equal set of six (the Indian sakali-karaņa or kara-nyāsa anga-nyāsa) may be, in view of the differences. Five times does my ritual deal with this set, in my Ca, Ma, Na, Nh, H&rsquo;; one other time does it occur in the fragmentary ms Bhasma (designated by Bh), K 475. The Comparative Table is to be found under c) infra, pages 26 and 27 bottom. Only sańkëpi, dealt with under b) infra, has not been repeated in my text, partly because the mss hardly ever repeat it, partly because it is so long and occurs so frequently. a. ASTRA-MANTRA, at its shortest shape consists of only: OM HUM RAH PHAT ASTRAYA NAMAH, homage be to the Brand. This formula, too, is known outside the world of the padandas, for it is found passim in DHARMA PAVAYANAN, the Eternal Law for the Shadow Play, the short metaphysical treatise which must be studied by a dalaň, puppeteer, who wishes to become an amańku dalan and to be invited to stage the more specific exorcistic performances. Judging from the situations in which the astra-mantra is used, this expression of homage to (Śiva&rsquo;s) missile, and from the general character of Hindu ritual in Bali (continuous averting of malevolent influences and the invocating of benevolent powers) one can say that several stages of the priest&rsquo;s mystical dealing with the Unfathomable are concluded by his invocating of Śiva&rsquo;s brand in order that the action just finished may not be undone (avighnam astu). Astra-mantra is followed not unfrequently by the following words Om ātma-tattvātma śuddha mām svāhā, om om Kşamā-sampūrṇāya namaḥ svāhā, om Śri Paśupataye namah, i.e. Purify me, oh! Soul of Deepest [[021]] Reality! Homage to Him Who displays perfect forgiveness! Homage be to Paśupati! Lévi 13 reads (without initial om and omitting a second om): ātma- tattvāya namaḥ, om sodhaya mām svāhā, om Ks. etc. Here Lévi continues with the śri ambha mantra mentioned above; only the &lsquo;ksatriya mss&rsquo; do the same; it might be optional here. In all the mss these words conclude with patañanan mudrā, which, in a score of cases during this ritual, is mentioned as a conclusion (and not as a start as in Lévi&rsquo;s 14). Patañanan as a mark of caesura in the ritual, will be discussed infra; here we must go on with a still more extended form of astra-mantra. ASTRA-MANTRA KABEH (=all, complete), Lévi&rsquo;s 14, is a formula some- times to be found in the mss, though not in this connection. Here, only the YRW mss repeat Astra-mantra, and the Y ms contains the element Om Śrī Pasupataye namaḥ, which is absent in Lévi. Lévi continues with Nārāca-mudrāya namaḥ, homage be to the mudrā called &lsquo;arrow&rsquo;, and with this honour bestowed upon the priest&rsquo;s mudrā as if it were a god, no: because now it is a divine power, we are in the sphere analysed by Diehl who, more than once in the course of his book, points to this divine power of mantra and mudrā. In this context it is necessary to refer to the Y ms lectio: nārācāstrāya namaḥ, which is, unfortunately, not corroborated, but is no mere mistake, and represents the equalisation mudrā=astra. Lévi goes on: Bam netra (this should have been printed as a rubric), bam Netra-trayāya namaḥ. It is not uncommon in this ritual (cf. my Nh 13, H&rsquo; 12-13) to draw attention to the human, priest&rsquo;s eye preceded by the bijaksara bhām; Lévi&rsquo;s comma does not occur in my mss, which here read om bhām netra [:] Netrāya namaḥ. The triad is not found in the mss I have examined. The &lsquo;ksatriya mss&rsquo;, more suo beginning with om bhām Nārāyaņa, continue, like the Y ms, with bhām Netrāya namaḥ, followed by the Balinese figure for 2, thus proving that their attention is directed to the priest&rsquo;s two eyes. Still more explicit are the mss mention- ing mudrās; they speak of left eye, with a mudrā directed towards the North, and right eye, with a mudrā directed towards the South, which tallies with the priest facing the East. Lévi then says: om [h]um rah phat Astrāya namaḥ, the third Astra- mantra in the course of a minute, followed by amrta-(sa)mudrā-hrdayāya namah, om Agni-Rudrāya namaḥ, and for once makes it clear that his ms contained homage to a sea of ambrosia, amrta-samudra, and that in this context he prefers the gesture, amṛta-mudrā. Hrdaya, heart, is only found in the Y ms, which has no third Astra-mantra: om am Padma-Hrdayāya namaḥ. Amrta definitely occurs in the ksatriya-mss and perhaps mudrā= astra (cf. supra) in the formula om hum rah phat Astrâmṛtāya namaḥ. Each of the words is well known to the priest and has an elevated meaning, but so long as only a trickle is forthcoming from our sources and that varying in substance, it is not possible to decide what was meant here. Lévi completes his No 14 (my B 16) with four final namas-kāras: om [[022]] INTRODUCTION 23 Sādhyāya namaḥ, hrum Kavacāya namaḥ, [om] Sa[m]nidhyāya namaḥ, om Agni-Rudrāya namaḥ, none of them occurs in this connection in the two dozen mss examined for this book, but all of them are used repeatedly in other contexts, in Lévi as well as in all the other mss (cf. Cb 7,12-14), and taken together making it clear that Lévi&rsquo;s ms wished to stress the caesura in his ritual, or that his informant was explaining to him. The first item of this tetrad is not easy to identify, as the character of Balinese tradition also permits the reading Sadya, the usual abbrevi- ation for Sadyojāta, one of Śiva&rsquo;s five aspects, passim to be met with in the course of this ritual. The entry sādhya in Monier-Williams offers a considerable choice, but in our text, its situation provides no clue, so that no endeavour at translation can be undertaken before comparison with materials from India. Hrūm Kavacāya namaḥ, homage to the cuirass or coat, the Kavaca- mantra is met repeatedly in this ritual, and, though apparently directed towards the body of the officiating priest, which is the coarse envelopping substance and the carrier of the personal seats of power, it must be directed towards the &lsquo;coat&rsquo; of mantras which the priest has built up around himself. Thirdly the priest seems to pay homage to The Manifestation or The Presence (of God); in doing so, running ahead of his ritual. He ends by paying homage to Śiva in His awe-inspiring aspect of Agni- Rudra, located in the South-West (klod-kauh in Balinese), opposite the North-East, the seat of Iśāna, hence called Aiśānya (Ersanya in Balinese). All of this is a vivid reality to the Balinese, so much so, that in their mss they do not dare to write Agni-Rudra but always write Ani-Rudra. To sum up this detailed investigation into the shape and the meaning of the different types of Astra-mantra in Balinese ritual as expressed in Balinese mss, the following can be distinguished: a) a short formula paying homage to -, and in doing so invoking protection from Śiva&rsquo;s (Paśupati&rsquo;s) brand; it is perhaps permissible to call this the nista shape; b) the same formula enlarged by a prayer for purification and forgiveness; concluded by the Sri ambha-the madhyama shape; c) an uttama shape, Astra- mantra kabèh, noticeably longer, hence more important and powerful, but not adding an essential new element to the two already expressed in a) and b). The Anusthāna bvat Saura ms, K 298, my O ms, when dealing with the six mantras following the heading Śivânga, of which Astra-mantra in its shortest shape is the sixth, says in 1. 4a: Ana pva San Hyan Astra, kadi pa-samūha-n kilat Ivirnya, katakut déniň masalit masiyuń, i.e. Holy Brand Formula should be visualised as a collection of lightning, feared by bhūtas and kālas. The code word Astra-mantra is of frequent occurrence in my texts, more often than not followed by the words which are to be used. Consulting many mss provides the solution, which of the three possibilities is meant. [[023]] 24 SŪRYA-SEVANA In studying a mādhyama ritual one can expect the mādhyama Astra-mantra to be used; and it is only after reading the additional code word kabèh that one would expect the officiating priest to use the fullest form. The mss definitely do not suggest there is any rigidity here, such as is found in other parts of the ritual, where the sequence and the wording of the actions are strictly observed, without exception in every ms. The fact that none of my mss uses the introductory formula Astra-mantra kabèh, in this stage of the ritual, and that only the ksatriya mss have om hum rah phat Astrâmṛtāya namaḥ, seems to suggest that the author of Lévi&rsquo;s ms, far from actually using this item here, only mentioned it for com- pleteness&rsquo; sake, after all the priest knew he was explaining to Sylvain Lévi. b. SANKEPI(N) &amp; ΝΑΝΚΕΡΙ (N) is a code word, meaning &rsquo;taking all to- gether, acting with the complete set&rsquo;; the related word jankěp means &lsquo;complete&rsquo;. These are &lsquo;all&rsquo; to be found enumerated in Lévi&rsquo;s No. 77: gandha-(a)kşata-puspa-dhūpa-dīpa, and it is seen that the officiating priest addresses himself to all his perishable and imperishable cult objects, in doing so making it perfectly clear that he has terminated the preceding action or chain of actions. The difficulty-for me, here working only with the mss-is, that this termination is used very frequently, we might say passim, and the number of formulae so considerable, that often the mss simply say saňkěpi kadin uni (i.e. as before), or, sankěpi Astra-mantra (Lévi 146) and all too often restrict themselves to saňkěpi, or even sań. only; in many cases, though it cannot be said to be general, followed by patañanan or only pat. As, moreover, some mss present variations, this seems to be the place to examine them. Finally the Indologist Lévi mis- understood the code word which he rendered by &lsquo;mixing&rsquo; - imagine the mixture of sandalwood, rice grains, flower petals, frankincense and the priest&rsquo;s lamp! And the &lsquo;Controleur&rsquo; De Kat Angelino, did not, in his book, go into the meaning of sankěp/jańkěp: he was more impressed by the final bell ringing than by the preceding formulas and manipulations. - Here follow text and translation: Lévi 77 Lévi 42 SANKĚPI: gandhakşata-puspa-dhūpa-dipa. Aturakěna gandhakşata, gandha: om Sri Gandhėśvaryai amrtebhyo namaḥ svāhā; om gandha-śuci-nirmalāya namaḥ; akşata: om kum Kumāra-bijāya namaḥ svāhā; puspa: om Puspa-dantāya namaḥ svāhā; om kum Kumāra-bījāya namaḥ; om Puspa-dantāya namah; dhūpa: om Agnir-Agnir Jyotir Jyotiḥ svāhā; om dhūpam samarpayāmi svāhā; om dhūpam samarpayāmi namaḥ svāhā; dīpa: om Sürya Jyotir Jyotiḥ svāhā; Mudrā sakavěnaň. om dipam samarpayāmi svāhā; om dipam samarpayāmi namaḥ svāhā; Acting with the complete set of cult objects, perishable and imperishable, viz. aromatics, unbroken rice grains, flowers, frankincense, [Siva&rsquo;s] lamp; [[024]] INTRODUCTION 25 aromatics: homage be to the Goddess of aromatics and to the different kinds of ambrosia; rice grains: homage be to Him Whose seed produced Kumāra (Śiva); flowers: homage be to Him Whose teeth are like flowers; frankincense: homage be to Fire-Fire Light-Light; I offer frankincense; homage; [Siva&rsquo;s] lamp: homage be to the Sun Light-Light; I offer [Śiva&rsquo;s] lamp; homage; gestures according to what is appropriate. SANKEPI ASTRA-MANTRA (found in the WAR group of mss of VEDA KSATRIYA) sums up the same material constituents, and then goes on with the mantra: on hrim Gandhāya svāhā; om hum phat Bījāya namaḥ, on hrum (or hrim) Puspāya namaḥ, om hrèm Dhūpāstrāya namaḥ, concluding with: patañanan kadin uni, gestures as before. Apart from the untranslatable seed syllables, four times, homage be to the aromatics, (unbroken) rice grains, flowers and the God Who has (a brazier with) frankincense as His weapon or attribute, viz. Agni in the South-East. Now follows the madhyama Astra-mantra, running: om hum rah phat Astrāya namaḥ, om Atma-Tattvāya śuddha mām svāhā; om Kşamā- sampūrṇāya namaḥ, om Śri Paśupataye hum phat as before. The w ms, not unexpectedly, continues with om Nara-Hari-Mudrāya namaḥ, om bhām Nārāyana-netrāya namaḥ 2; the Ams reads: om Nārāca-mudra om bhām Netrāya namaḥ. They finish with om hum rah phat Astrāya Anantāya namaḥ, om Astrāmṛta-mudrāya namaḥ svāhā resp.; in partial translation: homage be to Vişnu in three different aspects, to the gestures of arrow, and of ambrosia (protected by astra?). Whatever may have been the original shape of these mantras and the history of their transfigurations in the course of the centuries, it is evident that the first sankěpi concentrates on homage to the material auxiliaries of the ritual, whereas the sańkěpi astra-mantra after having paid the shortest possible homage to them, asks for purification, forgiveness and twice for (protection from) the brand. When a copyist writes the first sankěpi complete, he may still omit the two sentences ending with samarpayāmi, and he may also leave out all three sentences ending with namaḥ svāhā and namah and pronounce as his mantra: om toyam (resp. gandham, (a)kşatam, puşpam) samarpayāmi, concluding with the Agnir&amp; Sürya-formulas, but not followed by the samarpayāmi-second-halves; both shapes of sankěpi(n) are found in the same ms. G. The first ends with the words om am kham Khaşolkāya namaḥ, homage be to (Śiva) Khasolka; followed by salahakěna taň dīpa ghantā, &lsquo;put down lamp and bell&rsquo;; patananan. The other may take this for granted, but has an enlargement in the caption that is worthy of attention: sankěpin rin śarīra-nta, &lsquo;with regard to your own person&rsquo;. This is not the only locus in the mss where sankěpin and siratin, sprinkling, alternate. The aim of this sprinkling, naturally with Holy Water, can be expected to be self-purification as well as self-protection. [[025]] 26 SŪRYA-SEVANA So long as the officiating priest is only preparing his environment and himself for the arrival of the God, kūṭa-mantra and śrī ambha are deemed sufficient to mark subdivisions of the ritual; however, as soon as he has saturated himself with supernatural powers by the concatenation of a dozen nyāsa, and in doing so has acquired the ability to get into contact with God, then sańkěpin is found almost exclusively. Even Lévi, who was clearly more interested in Sanskrit than in ritual, who gave no Javano-Balinese rubrics at all in BUDDHA-VEDA, and scarcely a bare minimum in his version of VEDA-PARIKRAMA, nevertheless in the course of this last does mention sańkěpi a dozen times (his Nos 38, 41, 43, 45, 77, 83, 87, 92, 126, 134, 136 &amp; 146).

There are a few loci in the Balinese mss where sankěpi alternates with sirati, sprinkle, an action which is as often practised by the Saiva priest as by his Bauddha colleague; the manual of the latter, however, never fails to mention its pakětis pasirat in detail: to Whom and in which point of the compass. Therefore the Saiva sankěpin might be considered as the counterpart of the Bauddha pakětis, sprinkling of holy water as an act of homage to the benevolent powers or as a placating act towards the malevolent ones.

SIVI-KARANA (cf. Table). This occurs as frequently in this ritual as Sri ambha (6 x), but less often than Küta-mantra, Astra-mantra and Sankěpi; it is not so much a caesura as a set of formulas to be discussed. It consists of 5+6=11 mantras, the order and direction (power to which it is directed) of which do not admit of the slightest change, even though the priest in the first pentad once uses bijakşaras only, uses full names four times preceded by their bījakşaras, and once extends them. The rubrics form internally coherent but different sets; points of the compass and the gestures may be added or not. As to the caption, Sivi-karaņa could perhaps be used for the whole set of eleven, as the mss do in Na and H&rsquo;; the first set of five is called (San Hyan) Brahmanga(-nyāsa) (in South India according to Diehl Brahma-mantras used for kara-nyāsa), the second set (San Hyan) Śivânga (-nyāsa) in CaMaNaNhH&rsquo;. The caption in CaMa runs Kara-śodhana, i.e. cleansing of the hands, which is ap- propriate for the five first formulas, and as the mss not unfrequently have their captions preceded by the enclitic word ta-, i.e. you (or: you should effectuate), in the book on mudrās we find the caption for some of the sixty clear drawings is tatkara-sodhana. Only the words of the first five mantras, however, apparently deserve the caption kara-śodhana; the following set of six deals with the limbs, anga, also called sad-anga Astra-mantra, to be translated by: the six limb-mantras of which Astra- mantra is the sixth. South Indian ritual, according to Diehl, distinguishes a five fold kara-nyāsa followed by a six fold anga-nyāsa (pp. 75-79); in the Balinese mss we find Brahmânga [-nyāsa] is used for the first set of five, Sivânga-[nyāsa] for the second set of six (CMNaNh). Diehl, p. 75 explains: &lsquo;Hand (kara)-nyāsa brings the divinities and their powers into the hands of the worshipper. Thereby his hands are fit to perform the limb (anga)-nyāsa, i.e. assigning the gods to other parts of the body&rsquo;. The caption for the two sets of mantras, Sivi-karana, grammatically speaking, is on one line with K dagdhi-karaņa and L mrti-karana. When Lévi, in his No. 56, deals with my M, he has the interesting caption: Śivi-kěrani sang hyang asta tëri sangkala, followed by this transliteration in Deva-nāgarī: Śivī-karani, śrī hasta, tri-san(s)kāra? As Diehl, p. 81 n. 3, tells us that Skr. sakali-karana, is the technical term for performing kara-nyāsa followed by anga-nyāsa, this Sakali seems to be the word represented by sankala: the three s are pronounced similarly in Bali; prenasalisation can be added, or dropped, and it is usual to find amrta/ amrti, dagdha dagdhi-, Śiva/Śivi-, so that sakala/sakali is not too far- fetched. Tri might find its explanation in the fact that Lévi&rsquo;s ms has three sets of formulas: Brahmanga, Tri-tattva and Sivânga, in this sequence, something which is not found elsewhere. Finally Śivi-karana, &lsquo;Śiva-making&rsquo;, &lsquo;Deification&rsquo;, a term not found in Diehl, is precisely what this author states on p. 75: &lsquo;In the end the offici- ating priest has become Śiva&rsquo;; p. 139: &lsquo;The Acariyar has by the Niyācam ceremony made himself into Śiva&rsquo;; p. 104: &lsquo;Here ends the first part during [[028]] which the A. has prepared himself for the worship of Śiva-by making himself Śiva&rsquo;. Diehl, p. 81 n. 3, borrows from the Nittiya Karumaviti: &lsquo;Through this ceremony divinity is assigned to the worshipper. He assumes the form of Śiva using eleven mantras&rsquo;. Once this is realized, it is under- standable why the anga-section of Śiva-making in Java or Bali evokes the technical term Śivānga, and how the Brahma-mantras-though dealing with the kara-(hand) section-got the caption Brahmanga. In South India, śakali-karana is repeated several times during the ritual (Diehl, pp. 100/102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109), just as Śivi-karana in Bali. Its importance will be clear. The differences and deviations must now be considered. In Ca and Ma only the bijāksaras are used; Nh runs: om am kham Khaşolkāya İśānāya namaḥ, om am kham Khaşolkāya Īsānāya Tatpuruṣāya namaḥ, etc. In the W line of my graph there is Bhūr-Bhuvah- Svah, Bhūr-Bhuvah-Svare and Bhūr-Bhuvah-Svah-Svare. In the Y line the plural netrebhyo (directed towards Śiva&rsquo;s three eyes) as in South India, is never found, but always the singular netrāya, once repeated for the second eye (directed towards the priest&rsquo;s eyes). After the Y line the O ms mentions: Tělas [,] isyakën ikaň sěkar ri lepa-lēpa ni tananta kalih, patalańkupakěna pva ruhur in Śiva-dvāra, &lsquo;after that, take a flower between the palms of your hands and in reverse position hold it over your fonte- nelle&rsquo;; this gesture illustrates the adoration for the God Śiva assigned into the priest&rsquo;s person. The mudrās from the K ms are revealing, but nevertheless present difficulties, when they are compared with the two sets of nine which Sang Rěsi Agung Pinatih Wangbang made for the Autonomous Bureau of Religious Affairs, Denpasar and exhibited there. Both sets correspond with the eight points of the compass centre; the first set is directed towards bhuvana agun, the material world, the second towards bhuvana alit, the immaterial world. The five first mantras, dealing with kara-śodhana, cleansing of the hands, as might be expected, prove to belong to the material world and are correctly directed towards Centre, East, etc. The six mantras of the second set are expressed by eight mudrās, as in the Y lines two gestures are made for the two eyes, and as in the W lines the first dative Earth-Sky-Heaven corresponds with Byoma-(heaven)-mudrā, the second dative jvālinī-śikhaye with śikhā-mudrā. Of these eight mudrās, four correspond with the set as drawn by Rěsi Pinatih, to be directed towards the immaterial world, as would be anticipated here. In the U line, however, the Na sankha-mudrā belongs to the material world, whereas Nh hrdaya-mudra, though belonging to the immaterial world, is directed towards the East, whereas the caption reads Agneya, South- East-but these slight deviations have been stated when dealing with catur-aiśvarya sinhāsana in my book &lsquo;Agama Tirtha&rsquo;. In the V line Na and Nh agree in prescribing triśūla-mudrā and Aiśānyā, North-East, which is correct&hellip; for the material world. The immaterial world, too, has a triśūla-mudrā, but directed towards the West, almost the opposite, [[029]] 30 SŪRYA-SEVANA For the W&rsquo; line, there is no byoma-mudrā in the Rěsi Pinatih&rsquo;s two sets, whereas in the Y&quot; line cakra-mudrā does belong to the North, but in the material world. Nevertheless, though details require a solution, it will be evident that kara-śodhana/kara-nyāsa Brahmanga [-nyāsa] deals with the material world, anga-nyāsa Śivanga [-nyāsa] with the immaterial world. The comment found in ms O/4a is illuminating: Ika ta kabèh DHYANA-nta kapva rakta-varņa, kapva somya-rūpa, sankěp rin sarva-bhūşana, mavèh anugrahèn hasta těněn, kivan mava padma; mańkana ka-DHYANA-n in Śivanga, i.e. With Sivânga one should imagine that He is completely red, that He has a benevolent appearance, that He wears all adornments, that His right hand shows the gift-giving gesture, whereas the left hand holds a lotus. There is no difficulty with the variation of terms for head in the P line śirah/mūrdh[n]i, and the specification Śiva-dvāra in Nh, and rahi/mukha for the face; in the S line with upastha/bhaga/k[a]upina for the sexual organs; in the T line with the synonyms cokor/suku/pāda-dvaya for the (two) feet; in the R and U lines hrdi/hrdaya (heart) and ati (liver), as the seat of ātman, are frequently mixed up; in the V line Bh śirah, head, might be considered as a loose term for rambut, hair. But even then Bh deviates in the STYZ lines; it is only clear that the application of bhasma, ashes, remains restricted to the supra-umbilical regions of the body. From Diehl, p. 79, one learns: &lsquo;Nyāsa with reading of these eleven Mantras occurs very often in the ritual and is called śakali-karaņa. The Mantras are the gods and through Nyasa they are assigned to a &lsquo;form&rsquo; (Mūrti), a sacred pot or the body of the officiating priest. This is done in the order of creation, beginning with the thumb and ending with the little finger, in the order of maintenance, beginning with the middle finger and ending with the index finger and in the order of destruction, beginning with the little finger and ending with the thumb. The order of creation is for the Brahma-cāri (the religious student), of maintenance for the householder and of destruction for the Vanaprastha (the hermit)&rsquo; - in Ca and Ma this order of creation is spoken by the officiating priest, but what the author of the Argha-patra K wished to express in H&rsquo; escapes me. It might not be superfluous to point to the fact that in Nh the sequence of the main directions of the compass mentioned is E/S/N/W, that of the intermediary directions SE/NE/SW/NW, neither pradakşiņā nor prasavyā. Deviating sequences are more frequently to be found, all mss agreeing in them, with the only exception of L&hellip; It will by now have become evident that while, on the one hand, Ca and Ma actually start with five mantras of hand cleansing, kara-śodhana, and then in the following six mantras use the purified fingers and hands for auto-deification, in NaNhBhH&rsquo;, on the other hand only various parts of the priest&rsquo;s body are assigned with divine power, the infra-umbilical private parts and feet always being the two last items of the first set. [[030]] INTRODUCTION 5. GESTURES MADE AND THE MSS. 31 Without the words chanted, spoken, murmured, and those which are inaudible, all of which are found in the mss, it would be impossible to visualize the ritual as it has been conceived structurally. But without the gestures and actions of the priest also, alternating with his words or accompanying them, the picture would be far from complete and would even lack a dimension. Unfortunately, the mss as a rule are very unsatis- factory in this respect, the only exceptions being the I and K mss. As no films exist, and if they did could not be added to this book, for the time being, this vital part of the priest&rsquo;s ritual, inevitably, must be in- adequately described (cf. the plates). The priest&rsquo;s actions with his hands or fingers, for convenience, can be divided into three groups: a. the actions and gestures which are described in OJ, Balinese or Sanskrit in the rubric part of the text; these are generally mentioned immediately after the heading and before the mantra (plates 5-8; 28; 30); b. eight mudrās accompanying the Astra-mantra, which is very frequent, often, moreover, forming part of the Sankěpi, which is even more frequent (plates 1-4; 29). C. a group of two sets of nine mudrās which are related to the eight points of the compass and the centre; these are, without exception, in Sanskrit and are nearly always mentioned immediately after the accompanying words (plates 26-27). In addition to this, one comes across trāsini-mudrā, which however is almost the same as cakra-mudra, which is found in other mss, and go-mudrā. a. SYMBOLIC ACTIONS &amp; GESTURES. Whereas the mss-apart from scribes&rsquo; errors-never omit a mantra or veda which the priest has to pronounce or has to have in mind (though a heading or initial word or syllable may be used instead of (again) writing down the complete text), the preceding action (e.g. making añjali/sěmbah, with or without a flower, picking up a flower, taking up bell) and the ensuing action (e.g. dropping the flower, putting down the bell) could in many a case be definitely stated after an examination of a considerable number of mss. But even though, in this respect, the printed text might, by comparison with the mss on which it is based, appear to be flattered, the rubric given here, brief as it is, offers, in general, an understandable picture of what it is the intention to describe. Moreover, the numerous books on Balinese culture, especially that by Tyra (de) Kleen and P. de Kat Angelino, are helpful for getting an idea of what is going on and what are the sur- roundings. Right at the beginning, however, a word of warning should be spoken about this book, not so much on the grounds that it is incom- [[031]] 32 SŪRYA-SEVANA plete (there are several more mudrās than the ones drawn here and some have no caption) but because certain details are wrong (e.g. in 38 the priest should not wear a mitre, but in 42 he should wear one). Walter Spies may have been harsh in his criticism of another book of hers, &lsquo;The Temple Dances in Bali&rsquo; (Djawa 19/6, 1939), but this fault-finding by the man on the spot was not entirely undeserved. Nevertheless, most of her drawings are clear and in the main sound, and have the great advantage that a full front view and a full profile of the priest is presented in each case. 1) Thus we find such important actions as: ñańkěpi, omnia, 30; passim in my text; with mitre, however, only after my Z; dust cover front and plates 9 and 25. prāṇāyāma, regulating the breath, 44; my I; plate 10-11. nili/nuntun, conducting, 48; either my J, P, A&rsquo; dealing with Āditya/ Sūrya, or my Va dealing with Dèvi Gangā and my W dealing with Bhagavān Gangā; plate 12-13. na-stava, singing praise, 34, my Xa; plate 14-15. sirat, sprinkling, 34; my Zb, U&rsquo;b, X&rsquo;b, T&quot;a, U&quot;b, Z&quot;b; plate 16-17. punu or mamunu, awakening, 32; my G&rsquo; and G&quot;; plate 18-19. tri-tattva, three elements, 36; my H, Nb, I&rsquo;; plate 20-21. mutěr ganitri, handling the rosary, 42; my V&rsquo; and V&quot;; plate 22-23. nicip toya, sipping of Holy Water, 46; my Z&quot;b; plate 24. kara-śodhana, cleansing of hands, 38; my H &amp; Nb without mitre, I&rsquo; with mitre. nanhāra ghantā, terminating manipulation of the bell, 56/57 top; my Z&quot; 6; plate 32. b. ASTRA MANTRA KABEH. A few pages supra the ritual&rsquo;s most frequent- ly repeated formula has been examined as to its wording; during the few seconds taken to pronounce it and in the few lines it takes of print, there are a considerable number of mudrās which do not occur even in the most elaborate of the mss examined - the Argha-pātra belonging to the Griya Kadampal (Tabanan), my ms I, a copy of which was given to me by I Gusti Ngurah Ketut Sangka of Krambitan. He also gave me the names of the mudras used here, and drawings of them, which he discussed with several of his padanda friends. His information is of the highest value as it is absolutely lucid, and has been checked and covers a very con- siderable portion of all the mudrās made during the whole of the ritual. For Astra-mantra, apart from its being used by itself, forms part of that formula used with the greatest frequency, the ñankëpin. The eight Sanskrit names of the mudrās, occurring here, in alphabetical order, are as follows: ākāśa, astra, cakra, hrdaya, nārāca, pṛthivī, vrşada, vyoma (or byoma) (plates 1-3, 29, 31). 1) There is a slight difference in the numbers of the drawings of the Saiva priest in the Dutch and German editions in comparison with the English/American edition.

[[041]] INTRODUCTION 33 C. MUDRAS TO THE POINTS OF THE COMPASS. These two sets of eight points of the compass, plus the centre, are used frequently during the ritual as a complete set as presented infra, or only in part (plates 26-27). The captions run as follows: JRO=interior; BHUVANA ALIT=the immaterial world name of mudrā paraśu=axe hrdaya=heart Saroarrow or astra brand vrsad(h?)a=? śikhā=top point of the compass pakënanya use, effect aišānya NE panulak vighna to ward off frustration; pūrva E ātma-śuddha purification of the soul; agneya SE pańilaňakën duhkha annihilation of sorrow; daksina S panulak visa to ward off poison; nairrtya SW Vindu-Rudra=(probably to avert) an aspect of Rudra; trisūla=threedent paścima W kavaca armour vāyavya NW dhanu bow uttara N muşțika/or pratistha madhya C S.

Finally, it must be repeated that the gestures are the weak spot in these mss. In examining all sankěpi passages, it appears that patañanan is mentioned in only 44% of the cases where one might expect it. Almost without exception, moreover, one has to be satisfied with this short term, for this word patañanan after sankěpi, for which no explanation is given regarding which mudrā mudrās is/are to be made, is all that there is. According to my informant, Astra-mantra kabèh should be used. Sometimes one comes across patañanan saka-věruh-ta, &lsquo;gestures as far as you know them&rsquo;, or p. saka-věnań or p. saka-buatan, &lsquo;appropriate gestures&rsquo;. All of this gives the impression that the mss as a whole are not so much concerned with mudrā as with mantra. This is not to suggest that the officiating priests do not care about mudrās. [[042]] 34 SŪRYA-SEVANA Diehl, in his book on South India ritual, points to the frequency with which mudrās accompany nyāsa, &lsquo;mental appropriation or assignment of various parts of the body to tutelary deities (MW)&rsquo;, my Na-Nn. It cannot be accidental that the list of mudrās which I received from the padanda Sarasiddhi covers exactly the same stage in the Balinese ritual, and that the I and K mss, which seem to be exhaustive on this aspect of the priest&rsquo;s activities, show a corresponding completeness in the same con- nection. Though corroboration from the other mss, which on mudrās are reticent and only occasionally mention patañanan after sańkěpi, would have been very welcome, the degree of harmony between the preceding texts encouraged me to present their mudrās. 6. WAY OF PRESENTATION OF THE TEXT It is true to say that, in view of the abundance of mss available, I had little hesitation in deciding that nothing could be won, and only the reader&rsquo;s patience would be lost, by perpetuating, in an &lsquo;apparatus criticus&rsquo;, obvious clerical errors. It would be wrong, however, to assume that the working out of the system of division and subdivision, which I finally adopted, did not give me a great deal of trouble and did not require considerable thought. And difficult the decisions were. What should I incorporate in the text and what should I put in small print under the line? Each of my predecessors in the same or a related field had used a different system of making subdivisions in the Saiva ritual. Lévi, dealing with a Balinese ms without any division, divided it into 146 sections, and in doing so more or less precluded the use of Arabic numbers. Diehl, basing himself upon printed texts, gave a number to a group of the South Indian worshipper&rsquo;s actions. Lastly, Madame Brunner subdivided the paddhati&rsquo;s divisions and added captions to the new subdivisions, in this way illuminating considerably the course of her ritual. Lévi probably worked with only one ms; Diehl worked with printed books; Madame Brunner based her text on two editions of a printed book, consulting, in addition, all relevant material. My edition is based on the numerous mss described in § 3; in A-Z the worship of the God (of the) Sun, resulting in His own preparation of Holy Water, is divided into some 70 parts; to the powerful string of Nyāsa (already dealt with in my &lsquo;Agama Tirtha&rsquo; and there drawn as &lsquo;Lingodbhava&rsquo;) the letters Na-Nn have been given. A&rsquo;-Q&rsquo; deal with the ceremonial sending-off of the God (Litanies for new moon and full moon days have been dealt with in Ap- pendix 3). The fact that the ritual has been concluded is expressed in Z&quot;b (by nicip toya, sipping of Holy Water by the priest). If, however, the officiating priest is required to use the newly prepared Holy Water for an important ceremony, he immediately follows his ritual activities by begging Jagat-nātha for forgiveness (my R&rsquo;) and after that [[043]] INTRODUCTION 35 uses one of two subsidiary rituals. In either case Śivāditya is once more invited to take up His abode in the priest&rsquo;s heart, and there He is dissolved, pralina, with the nicip toya of Z&quot;b as the visual expression that the ritual has been completed and that the priest himself is the first person to profit from the bliss bestowed by Śiva, using the priest&rsquo;s mouth and hands. Finally, I suggest that A-NI might be considered as utpatti and O-Z as sthiti, whereas A&rsquo;-Q&rsquo;, S&rsquo;-X&rsquo; or S&quot;-X&quot; ultimately lead to pralina, but though these terms are well known and used in this sequence (cf. X&quot;), these major divisions are not found (and are not to be expected) in any of the mss available to me. But these subdivisions and this hypothesis concerning the whole of the priest&rsquo;s ritual may become more lucid and more convincing after perusal of the next paragraph, the summary of Sürya-sevana. 7. SUMMARY OF SURYA-SEVANA, WITH TABLE The Balinese manuals on the Saiva priest&rsquo;s ritual never, as in India, run into hundreds of printed pages, but, without exception, consist at the most of only a few dozen of long, prepared palm leaf strips, which are covered on both sides with three or four lines of script; the typewritten Roman transliteration consists similarly of a few dozen pages. Only exceptionally do the mss start with the description of the priest&rsquo;s ablutions in his bathing chamber (Aa). Most manuals begin with the moment of the priest&rsquo;s arrival (Ab) at the square pavilion, balé pa-véda-an, which is open on all sides but has a roof, usually a yard above the ground, where he is going to conduct his worship. He approaches this balé from the west side. On the mat he finds two neatly folded and freshly washed rectangular pieces of white cloth into which he changes (Ab). He sits on the edge of the balé, his face still turned towards the west, his feet hanging down. He washes his feet (Ac) and hands and rinses his mouth. Then, outwardly clean, he turns round completely and sits down, facing the east and the trays on which are his cult objects, perishable (flowers, unblemished rice grains, frankincense) and imperishable (lamp, bell, brazier, water vessels). This is the position (sila) in which he performs his acts of worship and in which he remains until the end of the ritual. He lifts the cover which protects the perishable cult objects (B) and utters various formulas over them. Next he takes a flower and symbolically cleanses his hands with it, kara-śodhana (Ca). He cleanses one finger after the other, the right hand, then the left hand, and the palms of his hands. He goes on with the purifying of his whole body and with the throwing of flowers (Cb). This picking up of a flower, praying with it and throwing it away again, either in the appropriate direction or simply dropping it, goes on continually, but the mss mention it only sporadically, presumably because it is obvious. It is not repeated in this summary. The priest&rsquo;s [[044]] 36 SŪRYA-SEVANA clean hands, provided with a fresh flower, symbolically purify all his limbs (sarvânga) by a wiping action with the flower. He asks for forgiveness (D) and again symbolically cleanses his hands. Next he cleanses the tripod, tripāda (Ea), bearing the vessel destined for Holy Water, sivambha or argha, and then the vessel itself (Eb), by means of dhūpa-dīpa, brazier and lamp, i.e. by holding them above the brazier of smouldering frankincense and above the lighted lamp which represents the fire (Agni) of Śiva. He pours clean water from its container into the svamba (the pronunciation of sivamba or sivambha) in which, during the course of the ritual, it will be changed into Holy Water, and writes Am-Um-Mam on its surface in honour of Brahmā-Vişnu-Iśvara, (Fa), concluding this part of the ritual with Omnia &amp; Gestures, which are not repeated (apart from six lines further on, last line of Fb, again in connection with Holy Water) before the priest is well on into the second half of his ritual and the Śiva Soul has been conducted into his heart. From then on Omnia &amp; Gestures are frequent and form the conclusion of roughly half of the priest&rsquo;s actions. Finally the eight goddesses of the eight points of the compass are invoked in order to take a seat on the brim of the Holy Water vessel (Fb). To make it clear that the vessel has now been prepared to be the re- ceptacle for the God, a blade of holy grass is tied around it (siro-vistha, Ga); the Three Sphere formula puts the vessel in a cosmic relation (Gb). The Three Element formula (H) relates the vessel to another triad, which is encountered more often (Nb, I&rsquo;). The acts with the water vessel come to an end; they are longer than the preceding ones with the &lsquo;agents&rsquo; and much longer than those with the cult objects, but then the preparation of Holy Water is synonymous with the cult of the Sun (cf. Za) and its vessel is the focal point of the ritual. During the whole sequence of as- signments, to be dealt with in Na-Nn, all the powers of the Universe will be gathered round the priest and the water vessel. A wish for good fortune, followed by the brand formula, concludes this part of the ritual (E-H). After the cult objects and the two &lsquo;agents&rsquo; and the final receptacle have been cleansed and prepared for the holy act, the officiating priest must strengthen his own internal powers by breath control (I). This is considered to be very important, and it appears from the mss that more than one method can be followed which will produce the same result. This remark also applies to other important activities: the following J (conducting the soul upwards), P (conducting the Śiva Soul downwards), G&rsquo; &amp; G&quot; (a- wakening the Śiva Soul). The priest now conducts his own soul upwards, through the fontenelle, to a distance of twelve fingers&rsquo; breadth, dvādaśa-angula, above his head (J), and then proceeds to burn away all corporeal impurities (Ka) which might remain and which might form an impediment to the Siva-Soul&rsquo;s taking residence in the priest&rsquo;s heart, hrdaya. The invisible fire is ex- [[045]] INTRODUCTION 37 tinguished by Ambrosia (Kb) from the sky, and the priest&rsquo;s body is then immaculate, his soul is unharmed. The first preparation of Holy Water (L), amrti-karana, can, as a consequence, now take place. Once more the priest goes through the complete ritual of the cleansing of the hands (Ma), again followed by all its various accompanying formulas (Mb), before he undertakes the whole series of nyāsa (Na-Nn), assignments, by which he addresses all the cosmological forces and invites, if not compels them to come into his immediate neighbourhood or into himself. In this way he neutralizes temporarily any injurious influence that may possibly exert itself and assures himself of the benevolent co-operation of the cosmological forces towards the final aim of this series: the unifi- cation of his own soul with the Siva Soul. Two remarks should be made in connection with this sequence of as- signments. In the first place, none of my mss omits any of them or changes their order or fails to give their wording in its entirety. In the second - at least according to the interrelated I &amp; K mss and the notes by Padanda Sarasiddhi - the pronouncing or the muttering of all formulas is accompa- nied by their appropriate gestures. A kind of pause, offered by Omnia &amp; Gestures, only occurs after the union of the priest&rsquo;s soul with the Siva Soul has taken place, and after the different kinds of water have been offered to the Honoured Guest (the Siva Soul), udakañjali (O), water to which any guest and certainly He is entitled. The priest begins (Na) by once more (cf. Ca, Ma) adressing the five faces/aspects of Śiva, Brahmanga followed by Sivânga, this time calling his action Deification or Śiva making, Śivi-karaņa. Svīkāra or svi-karaņa, appropriation, might have been a possible term for the first of the nyāsa. He goes on (Nb) with invoking and assigning the Three Elements (cf. H). With Anantasana (Nc), Seat of the Endless One, his thoughts dwell on creation and the coarse elements; with Catur-Aiśvarya or Simhasana (Lion throne, Nd) the priest concentrates on the world of mankind and how to conquer it spiritually, so that he reaches Padmasana, Lotus Seat i.e. the divine sphere (Ne). Whilst the fingers move clockwise thrice around the brim of the svambha, i.e. in pradaksiņā, continually adding petals, the priest murmurs all the vowels, diphthongs and consonants of the Deva-nāgari alphabet, svara- vyañjana (Nf), never failing to add namah, homage, after mentioning two or three of them; in this way he assigns their place to them. In doing so, he aims at protecting his ritual, or himself, against any evil influence emanating from any formula whatsoever, for any formula can only consist of a combination of these three categories, and of strengthening himself. He continues by assigning, i.e. collecting and binding, the power of the Nava-śakti (Ng), the &rsquo;nine goddesses&rsquo; (eight points of the compass plus the centre: the always recurring nava-saña). [[046]] 38 SŪRYA-SEVANA Once more he repeats s(i)vi-karana (cf. Ca, Ma, Na), assigns a tetrad beginning with the Gods (Catur-déva, Ni) and a tetrad consisting of the &lsquo;goddesses&rsquo; of the four main points of the compass (Catur-Sandhyā, Nj). He goes on with Nava-graha, &rsquo;nine planets&rsquo; (Nk); he pronounces the seed syllables, bijāksaras, Am-Um-Mam, of the three main Gods (NI), and only then reverentially invokes them by their names-but the God is then present (Nm), and the pinnacle formula in honour of Śiva the God (of the) Sun concludes this whole series of invocations and assignments and strengthens their result and the priest. This result-according to the words inscribed on a drawing made by a Balinese priest-artist, the Lingodbhava, which shows a Śiva-Linga, consisting of as many padmas as the nyāsas just summed up, on the top of Anantasana, Catur-Aiśvarya/ Simhasana and Padmasana, with the petals inscribed with their formulas - &rsquo;this is the unification of the human soul with God&rsquo; (drawing reproduced in my &lsquo;Agama Tirtha&rsquo;). By the Upahṛdaya formula, forgiveness is implored from Him Who has just arrived; in Udakâñjali, &lsquo;respectful offering of water&rsquo;, pādya, arghya and [ā]cāmanīya are offered to Him, and this section of the ritual (O), expressing the arrival of the Highest Imaginable Guest, is concluded by Omnia &amp; Gestures. The Siva Soul, Śivātmā, is now conducted downward, turunakën (P), by Sapta-Omkāra-ātmā-mantra, through Śiva-dvāra, the &lsquo;Siva-door&rsquo;, the (place of the skull where a baby child still shows the) fontenelle, toward the heart, hrdaya, of the priest, where it stays. The syllable OM is made in the Holy Water vessel by means of a blade of holy grass (Q). The vessel is to serve as a seat for the divinity, and the Divine Presence, in the heart as well as in the Water, is announced and confirmed by the mantras Utpatti for the God&rsquo;s arising, Deva-pratisthā for His presence and the pinnacle formula for His adoration; Sthiti, &lsquo;abode&rsquo; for consolidation with Omnia as a conclusion. When the officiating priest was a simple officiant, he could prepare a Holy Water of a kind which enabled him to purify his body and his soul and to change his fragile and mortal body into an abode worthy to be the receptacle of the Siva Soul. Now it is this Śiva Soul Which directs the priest&rsquo;s hands and tongue in order to prepare Holy Water of a superior quality, in which ritual He proceeds in the same way as the priest did, by writing OM on the surface of the water in the svamba. The recitation of the same mantras Utpatti, Deva-pratisthā and Kūța, Sthiti and Omnia, in the same sequence, confirm the divine character of the Holy Water, which has been prepared by the Siva Soul using the body of the priest who had started the ritual. A hymn is sung in honour of the newly prepared Holy Water (R) and concluded with Omnia and since henceforth the priest&rsquo;s bell will be rung continuously, this cult object has first to be consecrated (S); this action is concluded by Omnia and Gestures. [[047]] Forgiveness is invoked (T); the ensuing actions, formulas and litanies concern the Holy Water, which in Its turn is consecrated (ñaskāra= sańskāra, Ua), and by Deva-pratisthā (Ub) is proclaimed to be a deity -the priest should meditate upon its being (caused by the union of) Ardha-narêśvari. In honour of Devi Ganga, the Sapta-Tirtha or Sapta- Gangā (Va) is recited, and to Her the humble and ceremonial welcome for guests is offered by Udakâñjali and pādya-arghya-ācamanīya (Vb). Sthiti with Omnia &amp; Gestures conclude this section of the ritual. The Sapta-Om-kāra-ātma-mantra, by means of which the Śiva Soul had been prevailed upon to move downward to the priest&rsquo;s heart, is recited once more to mark the descent of Venerable Gangā (W). Several litanies in honour of Śiva and the Holy Water (X) alternate, concluded with Omnia &amp; Gestures. Finally, the ritual stresses the fact that the Holy Water, tirtha or toya, is a-mrta, ambrosia, and that, because It gives dīrgha-āyur, long life, its preparation is mrtyun-jaya, victory over death. The formula accompanying the consecration of Holy Water is then recited again (Y). This is the climax and the end of the preparation of the Holy Water and is stressed by the latter part of the well known Brand formula and by Sevenfold Growth formula and Long Life formula and by the Omne quod felix etc., all four of which aim at one&rsquo;s own welfare, and finally with Omnia &amp; Gestures. After this unique accumulation of what are in the main, con- cluding formulas, the mss state that this is the end of the preparation of the Holy Water, the end of the worship of the Sun (Za). The priest sprinkles himself with the Holy Water, and the sprinkling of the Holy Water in the air in an easterly direction is meant for Śiva (Zb). Omne quod felix, etc. If the aim of the priest&rsquo;s ritual is a ceremony of expiation, prāyaś-citta, Lévi 112, or the worship of Siva-Linga, as in my mss ITSH, cf. App. II, he should perform the ritual for the one or the other at this stage of the ritual. One ms, called Bhasma, &lsquo;Sacred Ashes&rsquo;, K 475, understandably, says that the priest (after the recitation of the thought concentrating formula Dharmajāti, my Y&quot;) first undertakes the applying of the bhasma (App. I), then knots the sacred grass around his head, siro-vistha, as a token of the Divine Presence (as he did before, my G, when the svamba was prepared to receive It) and only after this proceeds with the worship of Śiva-Linga. And at this stage the priest might don the sampět, a black silken sash which is passed over his left shoulder, across his chest and back and meets again above the right hip, as well as a number of other adornments, bhūşaņa, fourteen in all, catur-daśa, each of which is accompanied by its own formula; there may be a connection between this number and the Catur-dasa-Śiva formula concluding this section (App. I). The rest of this ritual consists of the ceremonial leave-taking of the Śiva Soul, the Divine Guest, the Preparer of Holy Water, and of making [[048]] 40 SŪRYA-SEVANA His return to His celestial abode dignified. The two words in Lévi 122: Pūjā simpěn, &lsquo;worship of storing&rsquo;, as might be expected, cover a whole series of actions. Saha citta nir-mala, &lsquo;with a spotlessly pure mind&rsquo;, the priest again conducts (tuntun, A&rsquo;) the Śiva Soul upwards from his heart to the dvādaśa- angula, a point twelve fingers&rsquo; breadth above the fontenelle, Śiva-dvāra, by means of the Sapta-OM-kāra formula-but without the sevenfold repetition of ātmā, soul-which, as Sapta-OM-kāra-ātma-mantra, was used in full when the Śiva soul (and the priest&rsquo;s soul?) was/were led downward (turunakěn, P). A second brief reminder of a preceding part of the ritual is found in the repetition of Anantāsana-Catur-Aiśvarya Simhāsana - Padmāsana, Deva-Pratisthā, Kūța-mantra, Utpatti, Sthiti-mantras (B&rsquo;-F&rsquo;) which then follow, and which is concluded by the usual Omnia &amp; Gestures. The first thing that must then be done is the Awakening of the Śiva Soul (punu or pavuňu or pamunu, G&rsquo; &amp; G&quot;). To effect this, the Balinese Śaiva brahmans use one of two sets of fairly long formulas. The one set (G&rsquo;) contains a tiksna, i.e. sharp, penetrating, formula, and a vodhana (for bodhana, awakening) formula, which tells the priest to concentrate on Śiva&rsquo;s awakening. The other (G&quot;) uses the words ghrim-mantra eight times and is therefore called Asta-pājā, eightfold worship. It goes on with two more ślokas and finishes with the caption Sipta-pājā, standing for Iti Samkşipta-pājā, ‘This is Concise Worship&rsquo;. Both sets end with Omnia; only the mss dealing with the second set mention its complement, Gestures. Then again, for adoration and self-protection, follows the natural sequence of ritual acts consisting of $(i)vi-karana (H&rsquo;) and Tri-Tattva (I&rsquo;) and Upahrdaya Udâkañjali (J&rsquo;) followed by Pādya-arghya-ācamaniya and concluded with Omnia &amp; Gestures. Finally, there is one sloka of adoration addressed to the Sun (K&rsquo;); this is followed by the Pinnacle formula. This is repeated in one other sloka (Ehi, Sūrya; L&rsquo;), also followed by the Pinnacle formula. Then comes the act by which Victory over Death, Mrtyun-jaya, was fought and by which Long Life, Dirgha-ayur, was obtained as a result of amrti-karana, the preparation of Holy Water-this act must be restored to its natural status-quo-ante. The powers that were invoked and assigned by nyāsa during the introductory or building-up section of the ritual which culmi- nated in the unification of the worshipper&rsquo;s soul with the Śiva Soul, are again invoked, in order to placate or satisfy, tarpana; they are sprinkled with Holy Water and released (M&rsquo;, N&rsquo;). To stress the result obtained by the ritual, the priest then pronounces the eightfold Śiva-Ambrosia formula (O&rsquo;), an extended version of the sixfold formula in my L 14-19; this section is again concluded with Omnia &amp; Gestures. The conclusion of the ritual (Q&rsquo;) consists of the priest&rsquo;s praise to Bhațāra Sūrya, effected by means of a fairly long stava composed in an unusual [[049]] INTRODUCTION 41 metre, the Stambha Meru, and completed by the Pinnacle formula, Omnia &amp; Gestures. The ritual is over; the officiating priest, temporarily the receptacle of Śiva Soul, is a private person again, and the first to sip from the newly prepared Holy Water. His act of worship is called Sürya-sevana, adoration of the Sun, or Karya Toya, preparation of Holy Water, and before his religion acquired its more recent name, Agama Hindu Bali, the Balinese version of traditional Hindu belief, it was called Agama Tirtha, the doctrine of Holy Water. The ritual described hitherto clearly falls into two unequal parts: one, A-Z, deals with the preparation of the priest&rsquo;s person and his cult objects, with the invoking of the God and with His preparation of Holy Water; the other, A&rsquo;-Q&rsquo;, with the ceremonial send-off of the God. During this sequence of ritual activities utpatti, &lsquo;rise&rsquo;, and sthiti, &lsquo;abode, duration&rsquo; occur repeatedly, whereas pratisthā, from the same root sthā, seems to be regarded as being synonymous with this last term. Hindu (and generally speaking: human) thought operates with the triad utpatti-sthiti-pralina, &lsquo;dissolution&rsquo;, and this last term might be applied to the whole of a series of ritual actions to be found only in the Uttama group. The Śiva Soul, released from the priest&rsquo;s body, and supposed to reside at a distance of twelve fingers&rsquo; breadth above the fontenelle, is once more brought down into the priest&rsquo;s heart and there dissolved, pralina. Depending on the aim of the ceremony, two rather similar methods, synoptically summarised infra, are followed. R&rsquo; For pańlukatan, exorcism, the priest should ask Jagat-nātha, Ruler of the World, for forgiveness and speak a prayer addressed to S&rsquo; implore His anugraha, favour, concluding with Omnia &amp; Gestures. T&rsquo; Then he should T&quot;a For the way through &lsquo;Pañca-giri&rsquo;, after reciting the plea to Jagat-nātha, Astra-mantra followed by the Śri ambha and concluding with Omnia &amp; Gestures; Am-kāra-tarpana with Omnia and Nam-kāra-tarpana with Omnia &amp; G. (cf. G&rsquo;). T&quot;b After the ceremonial Cleansing of the Hands, T&quot;c homage is paid to the Pañca-Giri, &lsquo;Five Mountains&rsquo;, and the Lord of the Mountains, Giripati, with Omnia and Gestures. the God of the Sun in the Sky; concluding with the Pinnacle formula. U&rsquo; &amp; U&quot; Using the &lsquo;flower-conductor&rsquo; and once more using the Seven Om syllable cum Soul formula, the priest conducts the Soul of Siva the Sun downwards and reinstalls Him in his own heart, as he did previously. V&rsquo; &amp; V&quot; By using the Rosary formula, the priest reminds himself of japa, dhyāna &amp; yoga; this done, with another formula he puts the rosary down. [[050]] 42 SŪRYA-SEVANA W&rsquo; The priest addresses a song W&quot; The priest stresses God&rsquo;s Oneness of praise to the Heart (and the Sun in it) in a series of syllables; concluding with Omnia and Gestures.

B In G, there is sahab instead of saguan, large cover, plaited, bulging or convex, made of pandanus leaves which protects the perishable cult objects: flowers, incense, unblemished rice grains. The Gms moreover substitutes sthiti for pratistha-an incongruity that happens more often-and is also found in line 4, and after līlā it inserts suci nirmala, pure and stainless, the state in which the perishable items have been maintained due to the sahab. 1 The combination of the words jñāna and līlā is also known from another source. Goris, in his paper on Pura Besakih (DJAWA 17, 1937) says that in the Raja-Purāņa Pura Besakih (which is probably not as old as it pretends to be: 929 Śāka/1007 A.D.) there is the following passage: lila-jñāna is the name of padmasana&rsquo;. The question presents itself, whether jñāna-lilā or līlā- jñāna cf. the ease with which in L&rsquo;M&rsquo; tarpaņa toya and toya-tarpana are interchangeable - might be connected with padmasana in the preceding line Ac 6. 2 X: Pahénak dhyāna-nta, has the same meaning as pahěniň buddhi-nta and is followed by sakarananya, the meaning of which is not perfectly clear to me. 4/5 K is the only ms here to insert the complete Dharma-jāti-mantra, cf. Y&quot;. 10 It is dubious whether it is applicable here. I &amp; K, when using the Sri ambha formula, invariably precede it by the rubric Lin Bhațara or Lin San Sinëmbah, i.e. Words of God, or: Words of Him Who is being worshipped.

Though the mss give only the rubric, the mantra also has been printed. Lévi&rsquo;s om ban Netra-trayāya, homage to Him with three eyes, i.e. Śiva, does not find support in any of my mss, and it seems to be out of the question here where right and left are mentioned, as is usual, and therefore has been added here between square brackets. 20 It is surprising not to find a name mentioned between the introduction of the mantra and the final words. The hyphenated word which has been added between square brackets, is based on the Upahrdaya-mantra O, Vb, J&rsquo; and P&rsquo;, where Lévi 22 presents the less probable Sama- Kiraņāya.

As they are the only two mss to mention Astra-mantra, the sequence is not established. 9 Here Sankěpi should precede patañanan according to Lévi 47. This text gives a unique accumulation I PRANAYAMA. This is one of the most important activities of the officiating priest and is not omitted in any ms. It is described in different ways in the mss, and performed differently in present day Bali (plates 10-11). First in this book comes the concensus of fourteen of the mss used, followed by three divergent formulas. Next the importance attached to breath-control is explained by including four fragments from the N ms. Finally varying methods will be adduced from O, R &amp; W mss. 1 Isěpěn bāyu-nta sakê (lyan ni iruń těněn: om Am (L: KUMBHAKA) ban varna-nira; 2 vijilakën bāyu-nta saké [lyań ni] irun kiva: om Um (IK: PŪRAKA) irën varna-nira; 3 pěgën bāyu-nta sa-ka-vaša om Mam KUMBHAKA 4 vijilakën bāyu-nta sakė [lyań ni] iruń kalih: om Mam RECAKA na. 5 putih varna-nira; PATAÑANAN. 6 5160/42a: Om, ri(n) Śiva-dvāra; Am, ri(n) irun těněn; Um, ri(n) iru(n) kiva; Mam ri(n) tuntun iruń. 7 N/lb: om Am Brahmāya namaḥ RECAKA; om Um Vişnavé n.

In 3, 6 &amp; 9 instead of sattva followed by RAJO, TAMO &amp; SATTVA, one would have expected RAJO-guna, TAMO-guna &amp; SATTVA-guna. 9 Without exception, the mss have soma instead of the expected sattva; five of them in the last words have soma, four have the equivalent candra. H The assignment of the THREE ELEMENTS: 2 om om homage to the Śiva-element, 3 4 5 6 7 union of Siva Ardhanareśvarī, om om homage to the Knowledge-element, union of Wisdom and Thought, om om homage to the Soul-element, union of the soul with God, 8 Words of the God Who is being worshipped: head; three times top gesture; top of worship; top of the hair; middle of worship; heart; bottom of worship. 9 Omne quod felix, faustum fortunatumque sit. GESTURES 10 What the priest estimates as being the height of goodness: everything he has 11 touched and held, all things (previously) to be considered as impure, in the end have become spotlessly pure; that is his doctrine. 12 Brand formula: om hum rah phat homage to the Brand; 13 14 Oh, Thou Whose ātman is the atman tattva! om om homage to Him Who is perfect in forbearance. of sanképi in 38, 41, 42, 43, here 47, the justification for which I mistrust. On the other hand, it would seem to be corroborated by: a) L&rsquo;s Astra-mantra; b) my Saivite informant&rsquo;s adding: daginin gandha &lsquo;kşata puspa rin sivambha, i.e. put incense, rice grains, flowers in the Holy Water vessel; c) then follows the patañanan in six mss; d) the fact that this is a real caesura. Nevertheless, as the text printed by Lévi is the weakest bead in my rosary of mss, I decided to drop this sańkëpi, merely discussing it in the notes. 1 Inhale from the right nostril, om Am; 2 Exhale from the left nostril, om Um; (L: KUMBHAKA), its colour: red; (IK PŪRAKA), its colour: black; 3 Coerce by all means (power), om Mam; this is called KUMBHAKA; 4 Exhale from both nostrils, om Mam; this is called RECAKA; its colour: white. 5 GESTURES 6 5160/42a: Om to the fontenelle; Am to the right nostril; Um to the left nostril; Mam to the tip of the nose. 7 N/1b: om Am homage to Brahmā, RECAKA; om Um homage to Vişnu, PŪRAKA; om Mam homage to Iśvara, KUMBHAКА 8 om homage to the Soul of Sada-Śiva-this is the soul-union (cf. infra; 1. 18). 9 N/1b: Exhale through the fontenelle: om Am Ah homage to the Purification of the Soul; 10 Inhale, letting your breath fill your body: om hram hrim sah homage to the Supreme Śiva-Ambrosia; 11 12 IMAGINE: Holy Ambrosia flows from Siva-in-the-Sky, consolidating the Holy Soul: Next: Exhale through the top of the nose: om homage to Am Kham Ah, [[082]] 58 SŪRYA-SEVANA 13 om Am Kam Ah, om Am Jivita-Paripūrṇāya namaḥ svāhā. 14 Tadahi tañan kalih, usapakěn ri avakta, nirvighna phala-nya. 15 N/3b: Japa paña(n)děg San Hyan Urip, yan mahyun měsata sańkêń śarīra, ma-prāṇāyāma-ādi: 16 om Am Atmāya namaḥ, RECAKA; om Um Antarātmāya namaḥ, PŪRAKA; 17 om Mam Paramâtmāya n., KUMBHAKA; om Um Parama-Ardha-Narėśvariya n. svāhā. 18 Samyoga-mantra iki (cf. supra, 1. 11), mahā-viśesa; 19 N/3b: Nihan San Hyan Mahā-Prāyaścitta; kramanya: ma-prāṇâyāma-ādi: 20 om Hram namah, PURAKA; om Hrim namah, KUMBHAKA; om Sam n., RECАКА; 21 Samalih, sambun mantra: om hrẫm hrim sah Parama-Śiva-Atmané namaḥ svāhā. 22 N/4ab: PRĀŅĀYĀMA: om Am Atmāya Brahma-mūrtyai namaḥ, RECAKA; 23 om Um Antar-Atmāya Vişnu-mūrtyai namaḥ, PŪRAKA; 24 om Mam Parama-Atmaya Īśvara-mūrtyai namaḥ, KUMBHAKA; 25 Samalih: Vijilakěn ayva sarag: om hum rah phat Astrāya n., sarva-pāpa-vināśāya svāhā. 26 0/7a &amp; U/p. 1: 27 Isěpěn bāyu-nta sakė irun tënën: om Am n., dên tëkën prāņa nin ati, ia KUMBHAKA naranya; 28 Pëgěň sakavaśa (pěgën ayva vinèh mijila), om Um n., dèn tutug tëkën ampru, ia PŪRAKA na; 29 Větvakěn [=vijilakěn] sakė ghrāņa kiva, om Mam namah; 30 (0: yan tan větvakěnên ghrāņa kiva; kunan yan kavaśa:) śūnyakěn pusuh, ia RECAKA na. 31 O/1b: Pañjinakěn ikan bāyu-nta ma-avanền lyan ni irun kiva, ayva madrës, 32 yathā-śakti dè-nta mañjiňakën ri sira: om Um namaḥ, sira PŪRAKA naranya; 33 pěgěň ayva vinèh mijila: om Mam namaḥ, sira KUMBHAKA naranya; 34 vijilakën ma-avana lyan ni irun těněn: om Am namaḥ, sira RECAKA naranya. 35 The ksatriya mss R &amp; W, before the final patananan, contain the elucidating rubric: 36 Usapakěnền mukha mvan (or: těkên) sarvânga kabèh tëkën suku, i.e. 37 Wipe (symbolically, by using a flower) your face and all your limbs including your feet. I Lévi gives the shortest presentation hitherto encountered; it runs: om Am namah, KUMBHAKA; om Um namah, PURAKA; om Mam namah, RECAKA; (the middle formula was printed as om instead of um, perhaps due to a scribal error, as in Balinese script initial u and o are rather similar). 1-4 Only XKLYO add namah, the other ten mss do not. The brevity of the mss makes them continually use irun těněn, &lsquo;right nose&rsquo;, and irun kiva or ghrāņa kiva, &rsquo;left nose&rsquo;, and even iruń kalih, both noses&rsquo;, but as the Oms uses lyań nin irun, &rsquo;nostril&rsquo;, it was clear that Javano-Balinese technical language admits of both versions, so that the longer one was preferred here. Likewise, repetition of bayu-nta seemed preferable. It is remarkable that a dozen mss with different names fail without exception to mention the colour J TUNTUN (or: NILI) ATMA, the priest&rsquo;s method of conducting his soul to a place outside his body, at twelve fingers&rsquo; breadth above the fontenelle, is done in two different ways. Here, the shorter version, that in the GUL mss, is given first; then, the system as given in the Oms, and then the action according to the ITSHXK and Gmss; X presents both methods, the shorter first, the longer next (with the formula in reverse order, perhaps for the way back). 1 TUNTUN SAN HYAN ĀTMĀ ri hṛdaya-nta, (U: tananta těněn) vavên Śiva-dvāra, 2 (IG: rin dvādaśângula) dé ni mpu ni tananta kalih marěp rin sor: 3 om am Śiva-ātmakāya namah.

In accordance with L 48, the XY mss have Am (Um, Mam) namah; according to my Madras informant the use of namah is unusual there; it might only be exceptional in Bali.-XY also have Tēlas instead of patañanan, this time mentioned in all mss except N &amp; O, which give no regular course of the ritual, but to a considerable extent pay attention to what the priest has to concentrate upon, what he has to imagine, and what his actions mean. Just as in Malay dari, from, is not always used and clearly distinguished from di, in, at, (frequent examples in J. Rusconi, Sja&rsquo;ir Kompěni Wělanda běpěrang děngan Tjina, Ph. D. thesis Utrecht 1935, Veenman, Wageningen, 1935), so here saka insa(n)kin, sankén, from, is not always used for the breath exhalated from a nostril, and in may be used; saké(n) is uniformly printed.

(Eng. ed. 52, Dutch &amp; German ed. 51) might suggest that nili ātmā is used specially for the moving upwards, nuntun ātmā for the movement downwards. This, however, might not be general practice; it looks as if the terms are used indiscriminately. 1 In the Gms Śiva-ātmā is suspected. Ka When this has been done, BURN AWAY all corporeal impurities, 2 by using a red hibiscus flower, practising vrşada-gesture, 3 by turning downwards both your thumbs. 4 Take a red hibiscus flower, as a means of BURNING AWAY, use the thumbs of 5 both your hands, turned downwards, at the level of the navel.

The Sanskrit is not correct; the meaning may have been intended to be: It (sc. the Om-kāra), styled &lsquo;consisting of pure ambrosia&rsquo;, pours down Ambrosia; It is forever at the tip of my tongue; It may always rain down Ambrosia. If these translations are right, it would appear that there are two positions for Om-kāra according to two different traditions: Om-kāra resides in the kanthā-mūla, and Om-kāra resides in the jihvågra.

Downwards through Suşumņā, 10 using It to extinguish the fire. When the fire is completely EXTINGUISHED 11 and sins and defilements have been reduced completely to ashes, they are 12 drained away to the salty sea, the receptacle of urine. Then use Om-syllable, 13 called Pure, as a means of causing the Divine Presence in your hands : homage to Sim, fore finger; homage to Vam, middle finger; homage to Om, 14 ring finger; om hum rah phat homage to the Brand, little finger. 15 Combine all together: Am, palm of the right hand; Ah, palm of the left hand. 16 Full stop. That is how it should be done. 12 Kuta in IK only, and unexpected; one would expect Amrta-mantra or Amrta-mudrā. However, in Lévi No. 20, p. 9, it is the other way round: Sembah Amrta-mudrā: om hrăm hrim sah Parama-Śiva-Adityāya namaḥ. Moreover, the Ums actually uses Kūța-mantra, and Lévi No. 52, at the end, complicates the matter by using Amrta-mantra first, followed by Om hrâm hrim sah Parama-Śiva-Aditya- Tejaḥ śarīrāya namaḥ.

IMAGINE that Divine Anantabhoga curls His tail to the interior, with His head to the outside turned to the east, looking benevolent. It seems worthwhile to point to the technical term prabhūta, immediately followed by its para- phrase Anantasana-krama; just as in the South Indian manual the need was felt to have this (apparently antiquated) technical term paraphrased. Another technical term deserves attention: āvahana, invocation, to be found four times in 0/3a-4a, passim in Diehl, serving as an introduction before nyāsa, and in the I ms subdivision M.

He explained to him that the mudrā bhuvana aguň mudrā padma ka-jro correspond with svara ka-jro, and mudrā bhuvana alit/mudrā padma ka-jaba correspond with svara ka-jaba (my Ng 22-29; 2-10), in this way confirming the IK mss. Padanda Sarasiddhi agrees with these mudrās.

According to Padanda Madé, griya Lod- pěkěn, Sanur, who for the rest agrees with the I ms, here is found mustika-mudrā.

Nh Sivi-karana is my caption for Brahmânga plus Śivanga, borrowed from Na &amp; M&rsquo;; the O ms has Mvah manin āvahana, &lsquo;Again invocation of God&rsquo;, The available texts, sixteen in all, present one major divergence and several minor ones. The major point is that IKGOD here follow the sequence Sa-Ba-A-Ta-I, whereas the majority has the reversed order I-Ta-A-Ba-Sa. The places of assignment on the human body, borrowed from ms I and Padanda Sarasiddhi (who agrees with the mudra), tally; for the mudra, the K ms adds the same set, and IK agree in ascribing triśūla-mudrā to Śiva-dvāra and the centre, which is astonishing, because in the bhuvana agun/jaba/exterior set, triśūla belongs to Aiśānya/NE, and in the bhuvana alit/jro/interior set, it belongs to Paścima/West. Lévi and the G ms locate Bama-déva in Paścima, Sadyojāta in Uttara-in this way following the usual course of the points of the compass in pradaksiņā: E-S-W-N. Some mss repeat Īsānāya in lines 3-6. 2 Padanda Sarasiddhi uses Madhya baduhur, &lsquo;Centre Upwards&rsquo;, instead of ikan jro, etc. 6 The Gms, after having dealt with Sadya in W, Bamadéva in N, Aghora in S and Tatpuruşa in E, adds dalâgra, &rsquo;tips of the petals&rsquo;, before mentioning Iśāna in the Centre. If the Gms had been intended to be faultless, it should have mentioned dalágra after each of the three preceding asyas, &lsquo;faces of Iśāna.

The technical term āvahana, invocation, is used twice followed by pratistha (of. Nc 6).

With regard to the Brand, it is like a bundle of lightning, inspiring fear to those with (protruding) fangs and cutting teeth. 21 In the end IMAGINE that your body is the embodiment of Bhatāra Śiva Aditya, Pinnacle of Formulas. 22 After that, dissolution of Bhatāra Siva-Sun: on an homage to the Heart. 23 This is the method of worship of the Sun. 7-15 Śivânga displays discrepancies. The mss agree in the formulas, with the exception of IKP which have Svah-Svaré. The parts of the body are only given in the mss O &amp; I and in notes by Padanda Sarasiddhi; hence the differences in 10/11. In 12, the O ms has śarīra. The mudrās derive from the same sources IK and O only; in 8, IK have śańkha-mudrā instead of hrdaya-; in 12, the Oms has amṛta-mudrā instead of kavaca-mudrā; in 13, K has been printed in the text, I has trāsiņi-mudrā kiva těněn, and O: nétra-mudrā. The first insoluble difficulty is, that hrdaya-mudra belongs to Pūrva and not Agneya; and though sankha-mudra of the IK mss does belong to Agneya, it forms part of the set ka-jro, bhuvana agun, dealt with in lines 1-6, Brahmanga. Agneya, in fact, corresponds with saroor astra-mudrā, line 16. The second difficulty is that triśūla-mudrā (Aiśānya) belongs to the set ka-jro, bhuvana agun, whereas the triśūla-mudra belonging to the ka-jaba set of Śivânga, is directed towards Paścima. And though cakra-mudra points to Uttara, it belongs to the set of bhuvana agun, ka-jro, Brahmanga and not Śivânga. For Sivânga the dhanu-mudra (cf. my Ng 8) might have been expected. Finally in lines 13 &amp; 14 the Padanda Sarasiddhi prefers to use trasini mudrā, known from South Indian ritual, photographed in Madame Brunner&rsquo;s book (No. 34) and described as follows: lotus gesture; thunderbolt gesture; club gesture; wheel gesture; snare gesture; heart gesture; trident gesture; sky gesture; top gesture; coat gesture; vrşada gesture; wheel gesture; [[100]] Ni Tumūt San Hyan PITR-ĀDI-NYĀSA rin catur-deśa: 2 om am Sarva-Dévébhyo namaḥ svāhā, Pūrva, (I: anga), bajra-mudrā; 3 om am (Sapta)-Rsibhyo namaḥ svāhā, Daksina, (I: mukha), danda mudrā; 4 om ām Pitrbhyo namaḥ svāhā, Uttara, (I: hrdaya), cakra-mudrā; 5 om am Sarasvatyai (bhyo) namaḥ svāhā, Paścima, (I: jihvā), (nāga) pāśa-mudrā; 6 0/5b: Uvus mańkana [.] ta siratakën ἡ vai 7 marin těněn, 3x; om ām Sapta-Rsibhyo namaḥ; 8 tumuluy marin kiva, 3x; om am Sapta-Pitrbhyo namaḥ; 9 tumuluy marin těnah pisan, [3x]: om am Sarva-Dévébhyo namaḥ.</p>

Just as for Brahmanga-nyāsa, the G ms uses dalāgra, referring to the preceding set of four formulas, so here ri tuntun in aşta-dala will refer to lines 8-12. Ni Next the ASSIGNMENT of the HOLY SPIRITS etc. in the four points of the compass: 2 om am homage to all the Gods, East, (I: limbs), 3 om am homage to the (seven) Sages South, (I: face), 4 om am homage to the Spirits, North, (I: heart), 5 om am homage to (the) Sarasvati(s), West, (I: tongue), 6/7 Next, SPRINKLE to the South, three times: om am homage to the Seven Sages; 8 then to the North, three times: om am homage to the Seven Spirits; 9 then to the Centre, three times: om am homage to All the Gods. thunderbolt gesture; club gesture; wheel gesture; serpent-snare gesture. Sarasvati in Bali may have crept in at the expense of ātmā. Finally Sarasvati in the West instead of in the South is unexpected, to say the least of it. 2 A smaller irregularity is formed by the fact that after the caption pitr-ādi, one would expect to find the pitr mentioned first. 2-4 The points of the compass, too, diverge: in 2, U has Agneya; in 3, P has Uttara; in 4 L has Paścima, UP have Dakşina; in 6, L has Uttara, U has Dakşina. 3-4 Sapta-rşibhyo only in the GU mss; G even Sapta-Pitrbhyo, which seems an obvious mistake. 2-5 Padanda Sarasiddhi gives the same set of mudrā. Nj Then follows the ASSIGNMENT of the FOUR SANDHYĀS: om am homage to the: (Padanda Sarasiddhi) (I) (I) (IK) 2 Bright Goddess, E., sexual organs, thunderbolt SE, both feet, conch 3 Devotion Goddess, S., hands, club SW, both hands, sword 4 Dark Goddess, W., mouth, snare NW, mouth, streamer 5 ? Goddess, N., spot between wheel NE, head/tips top the eyebrows, gesture, of the hair, trident 6 One more formula: 7 om am kham homage to Khasolka, the Heart containing the germ of Śiva, 8 9 10 C., heart, heart gesture; heart; lotus in interior; presence gesture of the body, in lines 2 and 5, are different. What is more difficult, is śikhā-(mudrā) in line 5, given by the I ms, for this mudra points to Nairrtya and belongs to the set of bhuvana alit, ka jaba, used for the last formula. But even if it is assumed that the words śikhā-mudrā do belong to line 10 (the text has been enlarged upon by commentary and a few words might have become dislodged), where the I ms fails to give a mudra, though one would be expected, the K ms&rsquo; pratistha-mudra-mustika-mudrā seems preferable (cf. also I ms in Ng 10). Nk Then follows the ASSIGNMENT of the PLANETS in a CIRCLE, or &lsquo;EIGHT PLANETS&rsquo;. 2 om sam homage to the white-coloured Moon, East, thunderbolt gesture; [[102]] 78 3 om bam Budhāya 4 om vẹm Vṛhaspatayé 5 om bhām Bhargavāya 6 om am Angārāya 7 om sam Sanaiścarāya 8 om ram Rahavéya 9 om kam Kétavéya 10 0/4b: Uvus mańkana, pūjā-nta ń graha ri yava niň prativaraņa, āvahana 11 rumuhun (as supra).

Nk GP: Pasan tan aşta graha ka jaba, sakên svara; ndya ta? This initial word pasań corroborates Lévi&rsquo;s NYĀSA, which is not found in any other ms: the Tumumpan SOMA in XY recalls the tumumpan which occurred in relation to Anantasana, Catur-Aiśvarya Sinhasana and Padmasana, and actually the object of worship is one tier (or: one lotus) higher up in the drawing of Lingod- bhava reproduced in &lsquo;Agama Tirtha&rsquo;. Avarana, according to Diehl, p. 136, &lsquo;consists in worshipping gods in the eight quarters beginning in the East and ending&hellip; in the NE by means of the seed-syllables&rsquo;. Though the formulas are fuller in our texts by their giving complete names after the seed-syllables an, ban, etc., it is evident that avarana is the Sanskrit technical term for the more colloquial but less significant pa-ider-an. For SOMA-ADI cf. Pitrādi (my Ni). Sanskrit graha, planet, is pronounced in Balinese grěhě or grěhö; Sanskrit grha, house, would be pronounced in the same way (though in the past as griya it has been borrowed, brahman priest&rsquo;s compound). 2-9 Padanda Sarasiddhi agrees with the mudra. 10 prativāraņa means &lsquo;keeping off, warding off&rsquo;; the meaning of sakên svara might be: as distinct from the svara of my Nf, which themselves constituted the most outward circle of assignments. SURYA-SEVANA camika-varņāya namaḥ, daksina, danda-mudrā; pita-varņāya namaḥ, paścima, nāga-pāśa-mudrā; śyāma-varņāya namaḥ, uttara, cakra-mudrā; rakta-varņāya namaḥ, āgneya, śańkha-mudrā; krsna-varņāya namaḥ, nairrtya, khadga-mudra; rājāva [r]ta-varņāya namaḥ, vāyavya, dhvaja-mudrā; dhūmra-varņāya namaḥ, aiśānya, triśūla-mudrā. NI Muvah TRY-AKSARA-mantra: 2 om Mam namaḥ, triśūla-mudrā (IK; Padanda Sarasiddhi: ruhur; bajra-mudrā); 3 (I: rasa, nāda, vijil in ghantā; tuntun); 4 om Um namah, cakra-mudra (IK; Padanda Sarasiddhi: madhya, cakra-mudrā; 5 (I: raśmi, vindu, vijil in sankha; madhya); 6 om Am namaḥ, padma-mudrā (IK; Padanda Sarasiddhi: sor, danda-mudrā); 7 (I: sparsa, ardha-candra, vijil in dipa; i sor). 8 Tumût San Hyan TRI-SAMAYA-NYĀSA: i sor, in madhya mvan i ruhur: 9 om am Brahmane namaḥ, danda-mudrā (I: vijil in kalpika mvan sěkar); 10 om um Vişnave namaḥ, cakra-mudrā (I: vijil in &lsquo;ksata); 11 om mam Iśvarāya namaḥ, bajra-mudrā (I: vijil in gandha). NI Triśūla-mudrā for Iśāna, residing in Aiśānya, the N-E, is quite normal; so is vajra for the East and His abode there. 6 Padma-mudra for Am, Brahma, in the South, is unexpected; but all mudrā in the Nl section do belong to the same set. 8 The word NYASA is in the LUA mss only. [[103]] TEXT, TRANSLATION AND NOTES 79 3 om bam homage to the red-coloured Mercury, S, club gesture; 4 om vrm homage to the yellow-coloured Jupiter, W, snare gesture; 5 om bham homage to the black-coloured Venus, N, wheel gesture; 6 om am homage to the red-coloured Mars, SE, conch gesture; 7 om sam homage to the black-coloured Saturn, SW, sword gesture; 8 om ram homage to the diamond-coloured &lsquo;Seizer&rsquo;, NW, streamer gesture; 9 om kam homage to the smokey-coloured Kétu, NE, trident gesture; 10 After that, worship the planets at the outside of the &lsquo;fence&rsquo;; the right course 11 consists first of an invocation (as supra). IMAGINE that the Moon is 12 white, etc. Keep your left hand on your thigh, to the right side, in the gesture of fearlessness. All of them have two arms and are completely 13 adorned. Sanaiścara is kept in fear by the evil demons; Rahu has 14 a red face and bushy brows, has only half a body, worshipping 15 God Śiva the Sun. In that way one should IMAGINE the Eight Planets. With 16 regard to the gestures, for the eight of them it should be the gesture of 17 simple worship; the worship for all of them should consist of water for the feet etc., with incense, rice grains, flowers, frankincense, 18 lamp, etc. Use the Upahrdaya formula; om am kham homage to Khasolka. Your muttering is the Holy Nine-Planet formula. It appears that the planets are to be kept outside the vessel for Holy water, at a distance from (I)śvara. T interchanges Bhargava with Vrhaspati, L interchanges the complete 8-9 with 6-7, and U makes only one pradaksiņā, beginning in the NE and ending in the W. Mention of the colours is found in my ms D, which was used by Goris, and quoted by Lévi, and in O. D is the only source for svāhā after namah, when it is repeated eight times. Sanaiścara&rsquo;s black colour in the SW defies explanation; Rahu&rsquo;s being multi-coloured-which he shares with the Sun-God in the Centre-must be ascribed to the divine soma which made him immortal. The change from Asta-graha (Eight Planets) to Nava-graha (Nine Planets) may be caused by Khasolka (in the Centre). NI Next, the THREE-SYLLABLE formula: 2 om homage to Īśvara, trident gesture (thunderbolt gesture); 3 nāda, appearance of the bell; top; 4 om homage to Vişnu, 5 wheel gesture; bindu; 6 om homage to Brahmā, lotus gesture appearance of the conch; middle; (club gesture) 7 ardha-candra; appearance of the lamp; bottom. 8 Then follows the ASSIGNMENT of the MEETING of the Divine THREE: 9 bottom: om am h. to Brahmā, 10 middle: om um h. to Vişnu, 11 top: om mam h. to Iśvara, club gesture; appearance of kalpika &amp; flowers; wheel gesture; appearance of ricegrains; thunderbolt gesture; appearance of incense. 9-11 Lévi and the Ums deviate, in harmony, in the following way, after their common nyāsa (U:) rin sor, rin madhya mvan rin ruhur: (LU): om um Vişnave namaḥ; (U:) ka těnah, dé nin ajñāna mvaň apt(?) rin Paścima, (LU): om mam Iśvarāya namaḥ; (U:) ka těñah, (LU): om am Brahmane; (UVA:) ka těnah, dé nin Aišānya mvan Astra Vètan.

[[106]] 82 SŪRYA-SEVANA O The IK mss here and in Vb, J&rsquo; &amp; P&rsquo; consistently start with the rubric Upahrdaya-mantra. 5 Aturana is only in Lévi; O has pūjā-nta; LYO only argha; LO only ācamaniya; O only adikrama. Most mss have the simple rubric pan-pādya or even no rubric at all. 16 The mss agree about sankěpi; the details are only given in IKLFV. But G has śrī ambha. In IKLFVAW there is patañanan, in KW followed by kadin uni, &lsquo;as before&rsquo;, in LFV by saka- věnań, &lsquo;as is fitting&rsquo;. LAW continue with the complete Astra-mantra; after the second line the I ms adds: kěpok ta ń kara-tala-nta pin 3, and after the third line: pětik ta ń dik daśa-désa jarijinta kabèh. For this technical term kěpok-pětik, not unfrequently occurring in the handbooks on ritual as an abbreviation or summing up, there is an illustration in Kat/Kleen, Engl. ed. 53 bottom, Dutch/German ed. 52 bottom. An Indonesian description runs: Bër-turut ujung těluñjuk, ujung jari tengah, ujung jari manis, ujung kělingking bērtēmu děngan ujung ibu jari. Masing sěsudah běrtěmu lalu dipěntilkan. Jadi yang bertemu paling achir dengan ujung ibu jari adalah ujung kelingking dan dipěntilkan. Jari tangan kiri berbuat untuk tangan kiri, yang tangan kanan berbuat untuk tangan kanan. Tujuannya ngaskāra sepuluh pěñjuru daśa-déša, i.e. One by one the tips of fore-, middle, ring and little finger (in that order) touch the tip of the thumb of that hand. Aim: consecration of the ten points of the compass. Cf. plate 2. P Turunakën San Hyań Śiva-Atma, &lsquo;conducting downwards the Divine Śiva-Soul&rsquo; is done in three different ways in my mss. For the Ums it is a matter of two words only; for G of thirteen formulas and five final ones, my Pc 16-18, a feature this ms shares with ITSHXK. A real difficulty is that Lévi shares G&rsquo;s first formula, which has Śiva-ātmā, though Lévi&rsquo;s rubric speaks about ātmā and occurs as his No. 60 after Amrtī-karana (his No. 52, my L) and before Anantāsana (his No. 61, my Ne) - but then the Lévi tradition is inscrutable.

I might like to add that Balinese ritual continually uses mahā-padma, in prose as well as in the metrical shape of sloka; several specimina will find their way into the collection of songs in honour of the Gods, a book with which Dr. T. Goudriaan Ph. D., of the University of Utrecht, is now helping me. The most elaborate enumeration in prose I hitherto met is found in the beginning of K 851, MAHA-PADMA, where eleven times mention of the point of the compass is followed by that of 1. the God, 2. the Goddess, 3. the sañjata, (weapon, attribute), 4. &lsquo;sana (seat), 5. śabda (one, two or three syllables), 6. mantra (monosyllables preceded by om), 7. manik (precious stone), 8. sědahan (&rsquo;treasurer&rsquo;?), 9. vāhana (mount) and 10. prabhāva (power over, sc. different natural phenomena).

Lévi with the words San Hian Atmā-pundarika-nta, i.e. your Divine lotus soul, to be conducted rin sthāna-nirên uni, &rsquo;to its previous place&rsquo;, leaves no doubt, but unfortunately he fails to mention the Siva-atmā, unless one is prepared to surmise that San Hyan could only be used in the case of the union of the two souls.

R The FV mss call the stava: Ganga-devi-mahā; the AR mss Ganga-devi-mahā-punyam; but as there exists another ode to the Ganga, beginning with the same line (6 slokas with the Saivites, 12 with the Buddhists), and as in the case of the ode called Ganga-soma a word from the second pāda has been used as the definitive, perhaps Gangā salañca might have its advantages. Or, as the Buddhist priests distinguish their odes to the river Ganga and to Ganga Holy Water, according to their number of slokas, by speaking about Tri-, Pañca-, Saptaand Nava-Ganga, and use this Tri-Ganga in their daily ritual (Pūrvaka Veda Buddha) and ritual for the dead (Buddha Veda), their name has most advantages. 3 Sahasra-vedhini, proposed by Goris, in a note to his No. 85 p. 20, mentioned by Lévi, and existing in Richard Schmidt&rsquo;s Nachträge zum Petersburger Wörterbuch 362a, has the disadvantage of not being given in a single one of the 16 mss available to me for this ode. Salañ, water, according to Apte III 1657b, is not unexpected, but one would need to be better informed about the folklore concerning the Ganga to be in a position to decide whether the idea that the Ganges represents water as well as earth, is genuinely Indian. 5 Anūksma, if anything, must be the Javano-Balinese active form of Sanskrit sūkṣma. Amṛtañjīvanī is well known in Old-Javanese writings, cf. Dr. J. Gonda, &lsquo;Amrtasañjīvani&rsquo; in BKI 89, 1932, 291-96. 7 Surasa in Sanskrit means &lsquo;well-flavoured, juicy, savoury, sweet, lovely&rsquo; in themselves meanings which tally very well with the water of the Ganga. However, in view of the fact that this yamaka deals with utpatti, once Sa-Ba-Ta-A-I standing for sthiti and once pralina, the Javano-Balinese technical term for related (pra)laya, might be the meaning which the Modern-Javanese S Sambut tan GHANTA [dé niň tañan kiva, aměněhi dada; rin arěp; 2 tañan těněn nagëm kalpika, ri buri ni taňan kivané]; 3 NASKĀRA GHANTĀ; sirati toya tan ghantā, pin tiga. 4 Ukupi tan ghantā ri pa-dhūpa-nta: om am Dhūpa-Astrāya namaḥ. 5 (Agëm tan sěkar) (Lévi 86: Nastava ghanta :) 6 om OM-kārah Sada-Śiva-sthah, Jagat-nātha-hitańkaraḥ; 7 abhivāda-vādaniyah, ghantā-śabdah prakāśyaté.

Gericke-Roorda translate by: &lsquo;zin, beteekenis, de geest (van een brief)&rsquo;, Pigeaud by &lsquo;bedoeling, betekenis&rsquo;, i.e. &lsquo;meaning, gist&rsquo;. To use utpatti ka m.c. for utpatti is no sin in Sanskrit; nevertheless a construction like: &lsquo;as to utpatti, its meanings are&hellip;&rsquo; is Javanese and not Sanskrit&hellip; but so is anūkṣma. 8 As Lévi probably had only one ms to work with, he is not to be blamed for his reading sarva- hitam, but it is not corroborated by any of my 16 mss. The Pūrvaka Veda Buddha by giving (according to pronunciation) Ut-pti Sa-Ba-Ta-A-I-ñca clearly suggests the five first syllables of the Sthiti-formula (to be followed by na-ma[h]-Si-va-ya), and therefore the corresponding pāda in Buddha Veda can be read as Utpatti Sa-Ba-Ta-I-ñca, with contraction of Ta and A. This triad utpatti-sthiti-praliņa, tallies very well with the surasās, meanings but it is exclusively Bauddha; the Saiva mss without exception read: Utpatti Sa-Ba-I-Tâ-ñca, a sequence of bijákşara which I cannot yet explain, pralīna being A-Ta-Sa-Ba-I, and Utpatti being I-Ba-Sa-Ta-A. Moreover, the indispensable element pralina is only to be found in Pūrvaka Veda Buddha; the Buddha Veda ends the pada with sariran devam, and all the Saiva mss have śrī-vāhinam, which agrees very well with the quality ascribed to the water of the Ganga but less so with Utpatti and Sthiti and leaving the preceding remarks floating in thin air, even though accompanied by Pūrvaka Veda Buddha. And so it is to be hoped that a colleague working along the directives drawn by André Padoux in his &lsquo;Recherches sur la Symbolique et l&rsquo;Energie de la Parole dans certains textes tantriques&rsquo;, Publications de l&rsquo;Institut de civilisation Indienne, fascicule 21, Boccard, Paris, 1963, may find the solution. 9 Originating from K 1334, Pūjā Kşatriya, cf.

[[123]] TEXT, TRANSLATION AND NOTES 3 Who by disease and similar decay, by leprosy, damageth impurity, Who shineth with the splendour of the moon, 4 Who art hrim-mantra, hath four arms, three eyes and a snake as a sacred cord, 5 Who art white and hath gone into the Ambrosia, Who causeth happiness and wardeth off decay of life, 6 Who art worshipped by Gods and demons and rises above the pericarp of a white lotus, 7 Who hath the force of the anger of Death, Who hath an imposing appearance, Who hath the lustre of pollen of camphor, 8 I salute Thee, granter of boons, refuge for devotion, to be reached by great eulogies, 9 Who art calm, omnipresent, endless, without personal existence, essence of the elements, devoid of qualities, 10 Who art omnipresent and maintaineth the world, Who causeth freedom for those who perform devotions and have faith, 11 Who destroyeth the evils of the spirit, Who weareth earrings, a tiara and a diadem, 12 I praise Thee Who hath vanquished Death. 13 Thou art emancipated, Thou art the world, Thou art in continued concentration, Thou destroyest the evils of the spirit. Yc Words of the God: 2 Whosoever recites these homages of the God Who is victory over Death, 3 obtains longevity, and in a conflict will be victorious. 4 Words of the worshipper: 5 Oh, Soul, Soul of the realities, purify me, hail; 6 om purified for the first time, purified for the second time, 7 purified for the third time, purified for the fourth time, 8 purified, purified, purified, may Water be! 9 Words of the God: 10 Growth in life and growth in fame, growth of wisdom, joy and bliss, 11 growth in Law Eternal and offspring sevenfold growth may be your share. 12 Again the words of the worshipper: 13 As long as God resides on Mount Meru, as long as the Ganga flows over the earth, 14 as long as Sun and Moon stay in the sky, so long one may be victorious. 15 Words of the God: Enjoy longevity, so be it; 16 Enjoy freedom from hindrance, so be it; 17 Enjoy virtue, so be it; 18 Omne quod felix, faustum fortunatumque sit. 19 The Seven Growths be there, so be it. 20 This is the song in praise VICTORY over DEATH. 21 OMNIA as before.

[[124]] Za TĚLAS in a-KARYA TOYA (PFVZ) TĚLAS a-SURYA-SEVANA (XY). This is the culmination of the ritual and its turning point. For the simple form of the ritual, the only thing that remains to be done is the ceremonial send-off of the God. Where the ritual serves special purposes, these are then accomplished. And it is at this point, before they end with the same send-off, that my mss diverge. The ITSH mss continue with a) LINGA-PUJA, b) BHASMA, C) BHUSANA; the KGBLPFV mss deal only with BHASMA; L 112 mentions Prāyaścitta, expiation for (minor) sins; the AXY mention none of these possibilities and continue. It seemed preferable here to give the simple ritual and deal with the extras in appendices. 2 SIRAT-i ŚARĪRA-nta TOYA, Astra-mantra-sādhana (plates 16-17): 3 om hum rah phat Astrāya namaḥ; 4 om Atma Tattvâtma śuddha mām svāhā; 5 om om Kşamā-Sampūrṇāya namaḥ svāhā; 6 om Śrī Paśupataye hum phat. 7 SANKĚPI kadin uni.

G&rsquo;a AWAKEN the Divine SUN using the BHAIRAVA formulas. 2 Take the lamp/brazier and the bell. 3 IMAGINE the Divine Being as Śiva-Parvati Lord-Lady, asleep on the Lotus Seat, 4 Their feet at the West, with you (the worshipper) at Their Feet. 5 Next, offer Him the FOUR SANDHYA formula, 6 i.e. Brahmā-sandhyā, Vişnu-sandhyā, Īśvara-sandhyā and Rudra-sandhyā. 7 [The syllable GMUM] enclosed by the syllable HUM in the beginning and at the end [of the formula], is the explanation of hidden power, 8 an explanation of all worships; it is stated in tradition to give fulfilment to everything; honour and homage; 9 om HUM HUM/am-um-mam/gmum/mam-um-am/HUM HUM om/namah svāhā. 10 That means that the essential being of this sandhyā (BRAHMA-SANDHYĀ) for 11 all worshippers is a torch for all those who worship and to the gods who are worshipped. G&rsquo;b Next, apply the VISNU-SANDHYĀ SHARP formula, viz. 2 [The syllable GMUM] enclosed by the syllable NAM in the beginning and at the end [of the formula], but it has been &lsquo;set free&rsquo; by the syllable NAM, 3 is the formula which makes one spotless; it produces success in 4 all formulas; honour and homage; om NAM/hum NAM/gmum/NAM hum/NĂM om/namaḥ svāhā. 5 That means that its essential being is a grindstone, a means of making all formulas more sharp (i.e. effective).

PATAÑANAN. G&rsquo; In our ritual Catur-sandhyā does not deserve its name, as it consists of three sections instead of four. Neither does San kişipta pūjā, &lsquo;Concise Worship&rsquo; in G&quot;, for between initial and final caption the number of syllables is the same as in G&rsquo; when complete in its four sections, not to mention the three sections used in my ritual. In death ritual, the spirits of the dead, potentially malevolent, after having been awakened, must be satisfied immediately by tarpana-mantra in order to avert calamities; this could not be supposed in relation to Śiva-Aditya, so that the tarpaņa-śloka is not borrowed from the death ritual and the text ends fittingly with arca(na), &lsquo;adoration, worship&rsquo; -but why should the Siva-ātmā have to be awakened, after having spoken as recently as in section Y? and even if this awakening of the Siva-atma is conceived as urgent, then why with Bhairava-mantra? On the one hand, the fourfold formula begins like AN-kāran dhyātvā hṛccandre from the Vajra- Sarasvati, Sadhana-mala 1/168, &lsquo;having concentrated the mind upon the moon of the heart&rsquo;. On the other the absence of declension in all four slokas points in the direction of their being Archipelago Sanskrit, a circumstance which does not facilitate the understanding of their composer&rsquo;s intention. In any case, when more than ten mss agree with one another, and disagree with Lévi, there is a strong case for assuming that they represent the Balinese tradition, and that L 133 deviates and is even suspect in that a pāda, as on p. 30 1.15, 1.24 consists of 9 syllables. The mss leave no doubt about AM and NAM. The majority of them suggests (H)UM in the first pāda, and for devârca(na) OM might have been expected but is only found in one ms as against five reading UM-but in Balinese script un and on are not always easily to be distinguished. As we are used to Am for Brahma and Um for Vişnu, Mam for Iśvara, it looks as if the bijákşaras here must be attributed to Bhairava-language. 1 Both punu and pamunu are derived from the verbal root (v)unu, and Lévi&rsquo;s informant may have said paüngva, in his No. 133. 2 pa-dipa-n (though usually: dipa) being the symbol of Siva, seems preferable. G&rsquo; was based upon the mss ITSHKGUL, as before; on top of that, on: K 69, Kajań Pūjā pitr, K 71, Ligya or Indik Maligya, K 1168, Sava-vidhāna, K 1423, Pitr-pūjā, K 1843, Astava Mantra, The shroud for the worship of the dead; About final care of the dead called ligya; Care of the dead; Worship of the dead; Texts (&amp; paraphrases) of songs in honour of the Gods. In K 71 (twice), K 1168 and my ms U we find the fourth of the CATUR-Sandhya with its conclusion by Sankěpi; it runs as follows: AN-kārady-anta-samruddham, AN-kāreņa vidarbhitam; TARPANAM sarva-pūjānām, priti-dānām tu siddhidam; namaḥ svāhā. om/AM hum AM/gmum/AM hum AM/om/SAŃKÉPI, preceded by the words: om gram Deva-TARPANAYA namaḥ svāhā. [[129]] TEXT, TRANSLATION AND NOTES 105 G&rsquo;c Next, apply the AWAKENING FORMULA, viz. 2 [The syllable GMUM] enclosed by the syllable HUM in the beginning and the end [of the formula], but it has been &lsquo;set free&rsquo; by the syllable HUM, 3 that is stated in tradition to be a supreme awakening of the God Who is asleep; honour and homage; 4 om/HUM HUM/gmum/HUM HUM/om/namah svāhā. 5 om ghrim honour and homage to the worship of God. 6 IMAGINE that the God is awakened by your worship. 7 IMAGINE that He is forbearing, hearing that He is worshipped by you. 8 OMNIA as before. GESTURES. 3 In supta aturu, we find the same short explanatory juxtaposition of a Sanskrit word and its Indonesian translation as in nava saña, &rsquo;nine&rsquo; and the Malay atha maka, &rsquo;next&rsquo;, to be imagined between those brackets of explanation which are needed but which did not develop in Javanese and Arabic script; failing that, the second explanatory word is often followed by na., i.e. naranya, &lsquo;its name is, that is to say, viz., i.e. 4 Dumagakěna ri kita sań amūjā (5 mss) might be the paraphrase of paścima (which is Sanskrit) jön (Old-Javanese; 3 mss). 5 Between one topic and another there is often a concluding tělas, &rsquo;the end, full stop, finished, exhausted, completed&rsquo;, and generally speaking my copyists were in the habit of putting it at the end of a paragraph; one imagines its being pronounced with a sinking voice. However, repeatedly I find it separated by full stop from the preceding words, followed or not followed by a comma, just like &lsquo;vus mankana&rsquo;, &lsquo;hisce feliciter peractis&rsquo;, as an introduction to the following topic; the pronunciation would be expected to be in a raised voice. 7 Lévi&rsquo;s emendations seem untenable, but my endeavours to translation of the text as found should be only provisional; vidarbhita is scarcely Sanskrit. 9 K 71 and K 1423: namaḥ svadhā; in G&rsquo;b 4 and G&rsquo;e 4 namaḥ svāhā only in UL. 11 Conform with the completely agreeing ITSH and K 1843; I do not take sandé as the equivalent to vandé, vuruń, &lsquo;frustrated, not going on its course&rsquo; but as standing for sandhyā. The last word, which, in another context, might have been sarva-pūjā, &lsquo;all kinds of worship&rsquo;, here taken as sarva apājā, &lsquo;all those occupied with worship&rsquo;. Brahmā-sandhyā is not only in G but also in Κ 71, Κ 1423; all mss continue: pandilah nin sarva; TS: deva; G, K 71, K 1423 and K 1843: pūjā; Gand K 1423: mvan sarva; TSH and K 1423: pinūjā; G, K 71 and K 1423: tattva; T, G, K 71 and K 1423 nira or San Hyan and K 1843: sira. The divergence in the mss makes the text and translation shaky. G&rsquo;c 2 Here and in line 7 my typewritten copies of mss give no decision whether to read UM or HUM. G&rsquo;c 3 devasya, according to K 1168/2a; the other mss have mantrasya. bodhanam here correct, ef. vodhanam in line 17; cf. also vimba pro bimba in my O line 14. 8 At this stage, my Saivite informant made the remark: usan pesan, &lsquo;completely finished&rsquo;. [The syllable GMUM) enclosed by the syllable AM in the beginning and the end [of the formula], but also loosened by the syllable AM, is the satiating of all worship, and it gives the accomplishment of all [formulas?] that give satisfaction. Next the mss KUPA and K 69 offer the following PUNU, about which my Saivite informant gave this comment: jaran; yan in tan angé TRI-(sic!)-Sandhyā, &rsquo;exceptional; when TRI-Sandhya is not used&rsquo;. Note that he speaks, quite realistically, about TRI-Sandhyā; it can be seen, moreover, that in the mss KU this PUNU is mentioned as a second possibility, and in the mss PA appears to be the only one.

<h2 id="iii-a-balinese-priests-detailed-comment">III. A BALINESE PRIEST&rsquo;S DETAILED COMMENT</h2>
<p>In the last paragraph of the Introduction, I have endeavoured to give a summary of the ritual dealt with in this monograph, and the table added there represents the backbone of my interpretation. In doing so, I reached my aim of presenting the Javano-Balinese materials in a shape so that they can be used by my colleagues who feel themselves better at home in the Indian field than I do, I do hope that Dr. Diehl and Madame Brunner, who added excellent indices to their books, and their successors in the future, who are interested in Sankhya, Saiva-Siddhānta and Tantra, will feel attracted to the task of comparing it which would take me too far from the Balinese Pit which I consider it my privilege and duty to reconnoitre. Apart from the remark that PUNU, the awakening of the God, dealt with in G&rsquo; &amp; G&quot;, which also occurs in the death ritual, at the present state of my understanding, or failure to understand, seems, in my eyes to be better there then in the ritual presented here, and the fact that the major Śaiva or Sāńkhya manuals in Sanskrit cum Old- Javanese, originating from Bali and still alive there, have not yet been published, I thought it premature to go systematically into explanatory details. But when the major part of this monograph had been written and the first type written copy made, I was presented with the Argha-pātra ms from the griya Kadampal (Tabanan), my I. This proved to be a ms not only as good as the T, S &amp; H mss, but also the only one currently comment- ing on the priest&rsquo;s actions and, more often than not, paraphrasing his words. By its amplification of rubric it clarified many a situation con- siderably, so that the whole Text, Translation and Notes profited from it and had to be rewritten. Still, I had a considerable period of hesitation before the decision was taken to embody a large part of its comments and some paraphrases into this monograph. In the first place, after working for years with hundreds of Balinese mss and comparing sets of them as much as possible, the idea of working with only one did not appeal to me. Secondly several of its paraphrases are superfluous because the Sanskrit is sufficiently clear, whereas I am a little fearful that some of the comments may prove to be less valid. From the philologist&rsquo;s point of view this might be detrimental, but not to the social anthropologist, who may be more interested in the meaning now attached to actions and words than to the meaning they may have had in the dim past. The most remarkable feature of the I ms (supported by K, but that originates from practically the same place and proves to be closely related) might be this, that it puts consistently the śrī ambha or triyantu formula (Omne quod felix, faustum fortunatumque sit) into the mouth of the God, in this way predicting happiness and good fortune to His faithful worship- [[157]] 132 SŪRYA-SEVANA per. At the very end of the ritual, my Yc, this even leads to a kind of short dialogue between the God and His worshipper. I was hesitant about including these short rubrics in my text rather than in the notes, and I am still not quite sure that I have done the right thing, but I felt it was better to be criticised for doing it than the rubric be overlooked in the notes. The intercalation of this third chapter, moreover, produces a certain balance in this book. No longer is it only the foreign non-Hindu student who imposes his views: he is counterbalanced by the authority of the Śaiva priest himself. It must not be expected that the Balinese priest will give an analysis or a synthesis; he comments upon his text and paraphrases its language. So, it will be evident that for the comments reproduced (and translated) in the text and in this chapter, the griya Kadampal only can be held responsible, and that they are not necessarily shared in full by all the padandas Śiva in Bali. In this respect, however, my experience suggests a far-reaching consensus, as might be expected from a small island, which it is easy to travel over, and from a group of a few hundred families, which frequently intermarry. Finally, for simple reasons of space, it appeared inadvisable, after having given a text with a full translation of the ritual, to repeat parts of it, with the paraphrase or comment and the translations, when they offered no more than a mere repetition of what already had been dealt with. (4-5 means: inserted in lines 4 and 5; 4/5 means: added between 4 and 5) (words from the main text in ordinary print; I&rsquo;s comment/paraphrase in italics) (paraphrases to the metrical parts are generally ignored; the exception: Puñu G&rsquo;) Aa 1 Bhatrinsa is the goddess of the comb, Yogini that of tooth-rubbing. 2 Om hum phat Astrāya namaḥ: S.

Correct Sanskrit is maheste; the need to use four syllables may have led to mahāyaşte, as iya and aya in Balinese frequently lead to e.

[[166]] IV. A COMPARISON OF ŚAIVA RITUAL IN SOUTH INDIA AND BALI. In 1928, Sylvain Lévi had the opportunity of visiting Bali for a few weeks, and while he was there he collected the material for his &lsquo;Sanskrit Texts from Bali&rsquo;; in this work (published in 1933 in the GOS LXVII) he wrote (pp. IX &amp; X): &lsquo;If the traveller happens to be admitted into the house of a local priest, of a pědanda as they call him, he will witness the same worship that is practised all over India, a regular Sandhya sevana; he will hear Sanskrit mantras recited in the Indian fashion, with the regular Indian accompa- niment of mystic gestures, mudrās&rsquo;. A few lines earlier Lévi had explained the aim he had in mind when collecting his material and in composing his book: &lsquo;The prime and chief interest of the documents I am editing here lies in the fact that they are a kind of holy relics of the time, long passed away, when Indian civilization had spread over the Indian Archipelago&rsquo;. Now, a third of a century after Lévi&rsquo;s book was published, it is possible to go into more detail. On the South Indian side, there are the following publications, all of which have appeared during the last ten years: 1956 Carl Gustav Diehl, &lsquo;Instrument and Purpose, Studies on Rites and Rituals in South India&rsquo;, Gleerups, Lund; 1957 Fausta Nowotny, &lsquo;Das Pūjāvidhinirūpaņa des Trimalla&rsquo;, Indo- Iranian Journal 1 pp. 109-154. 1961 N. R. Bhatt, &lsquo;Rauravāgama Volume I&rsquo;, Publications de l&rsquo;Institut Français d&rsquo;Indologie No. 18, Pondichéry (Maisonneuve, Paris VIe); 1963 Hélène Brunner-Lachaux, &lsquo;Le Rituel quotidien śivaite de l&rsquo;Inde du Sud selon SOMASAMBHU&rsquo;, same Publications, No. 25. For the Muslim period in Indonesian history, one&rsquo;s attention is no longer directed exclusively, or even mainly, to Gujerat, but for the Hindu period there is sufficient proof that it was mainly from the Southern part of India that Indians spread their culture, inter alia to Indonesia, and, I feel inclined to surmise that it was to this part of India that students from the Indonesian Archipelago went on pilgrimage, and even to stay for a period of study. In any case, a priori, no objections can be made to an endeavour to compare Śaiva ritual in South India and Bali; on the contrary, this seems the natural thing to do. I, who perforce reside in the outskirts of London, have not witnessed &lsquo;worship as it is practised all over India&rsquo;. And, as far as my reading about it is concerned, I have restricted that to the books mentioned above, which I considered to be sufficient for my present purpose as I have at my disposal copies of the palm leaf mss of the Gedong Kirtya, Singaradja, and also have easy access to the collection of Oriental mss of the University [[167]] 142 SURYA-SEVANA of Leiden. On these last were based Dr. R. Goris&rsquo; Leiden Ph. D. thesis &lsquo;Bijdrage tot de Kennis der Oud-Javaansche en Balineesche Theologie&rsquo; (Contribution to the knowledge of&hellip;), Vros, Leiden, 1926, as well as Dr. A. Zieseniss&rsquo; studies on Old-Javanese Śaiva-Siddhānta in the BKI (98, 1939, pp. 75-224) and in the series of the International Academy of Indian Culture, New Delhi (cf. also my &lsquo;S-S. in Java &amp; Bali, some remarks on its recent study&rsquo;, BKI 118/3, 1962, pp. 309-27). When Sylvain Lévi published his book, he based his Sandhyā-sevana apparently on one ms, adding notes from various readings in Goris&rsquo; Ph. D. thesis; for my book, by contrast, a score of mss was at my disposal. Undeniably, the Balinese side could, in this way, be better represented than before; nevertheless it is the Balinese head of the bridge that has to be constructed between South India and Bali that is the weaker, for South India can boast of printed paddhati of considerable length and of commentaries, whereas for Bali there are only the manuals of the brahman priests, each of which runs to a score of pages (an exception is the trans- literation into Balinese script of Lévi&rsquo;s Veda-parikrama, a limited number of copies of which were printed; this was done in 1963 on the occasion of the vast centenary festival called the Eka-daśa-Rudra ceremony). In making the comparison that follows, I felt it could be confined to a limited number of main points and that a considerable amount of material could be ignored. There are five main categories: A. Some principal thoughts and some repeated actions, both of which are common to the South Indian priest and his Balinese Saiva colleague; B. A critical examination of these thoughts and actions, their form &amp; meaning; C. Some constituents of the Balinese ritual which are either absent in South India or are much less developed; D. Some constituents of the South Indian ritual which are either absent in Bali or are much less developed; E. Some essential points of difference between South Indian and Balinese Saiva ritual; F. Conclusion. Abbreviations used. Lévi followed by number: the number refers to his numbers on pp. 7-32; Diehl followed by number: the number refers to his pages; (Aghora-Śiva); SoSa followed by number: Soma-Sambhu-paddhati; reference to śloka in section I, II etc. SuSe followed by letter: my Sürya-Sevana; reference to the subdi- visions. [[168]] A COMPARISON OF ŚAIVA RITUAL IN SOUTH INDIA AND BALI 143 A. Some principal thoughts and some repeated actions, both of which are common to the South Indian priest and his Balinese Śaiva colleague. 1. The first concern of the priest is bodily cleanliness at the beginning of the ritual; the next point is spiritual purity; this is constantly main- tained by the reiteration of certain sets of formulas. 2. The triad srsti/utpatti-sthiti-pralaya/pralīņa/samhāra, i.e. creation/ coming forth-existence-dissolution, occurs repeatedly. 3. There is a distinct awareness of the active triad: action-word- thought; many of the actions consist of mudrā; the words are mantra and bija; the thought element, is frequently expressed by a form derived from the root dhyā (In the Javano-Balinese rubric of the ritual the word idep, think, thought, may be used). 4. Tri-mandala consists of Sūrya-mandala, Soma-mandala and Agni- mandala, the spheres of Sun, Moon and the Fire. Although the eight points of the compass are protected by eight Loka- pāla, the worshipper, time and again during his worship, has to ward off the influence of the evil powers in the universe which constantly threaten to frustrate his endeavours. In order to control them, be it only temporarily, he performs dig-bandhana, fettering of the points of the compass. The most dreaded point is the South West; its opposite, the North East, called Aiśānya after Iśāna, the Lord, is a favoured point, as are also the East, and above all, the Centre. 5. The means used to fortify the worshipper&rsquo;s power consist of nyāsa, assignment; by invoking respectfully the cosmological forces, the worship- per controls them and uses them either to augment his own power, or he neutralizes them, thus preventing them frustrating the aim of his activities. In this connection, mention must be made of final tarpana, &lsquo;satisfying, giving satisfaction&rsquo; by the sprinkling of Holy Water. 6. A triad to which tarpana is offered, consists of deva-rsi-pitr, gods -anchorites-manes; a tetrad is formed by the catur-sandhyā. 7. The God Śiva has five aspects, pañcāsya, viz.: Sadyojāta or Sādya, Vāmadeva, Tatpuruşa, Aghora and Īsāna. Apart from Śiva-Sūrya (India) or Śiva-Aditya (Bali), a distinction is made between Śiva, Sadā-Śiva &amp; Parama-Śiva. 8. Diehl, in the course of his book, points more than once to the fact that homage is made to a mantra and to a mudrā, which are obviously considered as leading an existence of their own. SoSa-for its first three main parts consisting only of 73+23+103 sloka and a number of mantra, and judging from Appendice II, Mantra utilisés pendant le culte de Sürya, and Appendice III, Mantra utilisés pendant le culte de Śiva, pp. 326-27- in this respect apparently lacks corroborative material, but in Bali the same -mantrāya namaḥ and mudrāya (sic) namah are found. 9. The most used mantra might be the Astra-mantra: om hum rah phat Astrāya namaḥ, and the Müla-mantra (for the worship of the Sun): [[169]] 144 SŪRYA-SEVANA om hrām hrim sah Śiva-Sūryāya namaḥ. Common to both countries is the Tri-Tattva mantra, which runs: om Śiva-tattvāya namaḥ, om Vidyā- tattvāya namaḥ, om Ātma-tattvāya namaḥ. 10. Considerable importance is attached to Prāṇāyāma, restraining of breath. 11. A gradual way upward is followed in the sequence Anantāsana- Simhāsana-Padmāsana, and that expressed in Nava-śakti-Asta-graha. (What is remarkable in the Balinese mss, is the use of the technical term prabhūta, found once only, and followed immediately by its paraphrase: Anantāsana. The same word, but as prabhūta-āsana, is found once in the SoSa II 5, p. 76, in the same ritual situation. The Balinese tradition has apparently solved the problem felt by Mme. Brunner). 12. A set of at least five consecutive mantra, followed immediately by another set of at least six, has been specially printed by Diehl on his pages 78 and 79, and by Mme. Brunner in her Appendice I on pp. 323-25. The same sets of mantra (but not with the same bija) serve the same purpose in Bali where, similarly, they are used repeatedly during the course of the ritual. They deal with kara-śodhana and anga-śodhana, with kara-nyāsa and anga-nyāsa; together they are known as sakali-karaņa (which seems preferable to Diehl&rsquo;s śakali-karana); in Bali they are also known as Śivi-karana (which might be preferable to svī-karana, though one can never be sure of the Sanskrit s-s-s, all three being pronounced in Bali as s; sivambha and svambha, Holy Water vessel, alternate in the mss). 13. The worshipper is able to withdraw his soul from its abode in the hrdaya-pundarika before the annihilation of the last impurities of the body, moving it upward through the Siva-dvāra, fontanelle, and po- sitioning it at dvādaśa fingers&rsquo; breadth upwards from it. 14. The worshipper performs the unification of his own soul with that of the God, Which subsequently descends into his heart; in doing so he makes the God take possession of his person and become the agent of his own ensuing act. 15. Amṛti-karana, the preparation of Holy Water, is a recurrent technical term. N.B. Mudrā are a vital constituent of Saiva ritual in South India as well as in Bali; the names of the mudra are partly the same, but partly different. I have made no attempt to compare the mudrā: a film, or a system of notation is the only way in which the complicated movements could be recorded. Moreover, the mantra offer sufficiant points for com- parison. [[170]]</p>
<h2 id="a-comparison-of-saiva-ritual-in-south-india-and-bali">A COMPARISON OF SAIVA RITUAL IN SOUTH INDIA AND BALI</h2>
<p>145 B. A critical examination of these thoughts and actions, their form and meaning. 1. Reading Diehl&rsquo;s report on the worshipper&rsquo;s preparations for the daily rites, one is struck by the fact that eight pages are used for the morning ablutions etc. (67-75) and seven only (75-82) for the ritual itself. The SoSa devotes 73 śloka to its prātar-dhyānādi-krama (I), only 23 to Sūrya-pūjā (II), and 103 to Śiva-pūjā (III). For Bali, the percentage of printed lines awarded to this sub division is only about 2% (A). There is not the slightest reason to presume that the Balinese priest is less convinced of the need for corporeal cleanliness and of the mental purification necessary for his task, but his attention does seem to be directed mainly towards his cult instruments (B-G). He is far from neg- lectful of his morning ablutions. After performing them, he uncovers the tray on which are the perishable essentials for his worship, speaking the while a considerable number of mantra (B). Then he cleanses his hands, kara, &lsquo;doers&rsquo;, by kara-śodhana, using the set of five mantra mentioned above sub 12, followed by the set of six for anga, the limbs, the rest of the body (Ca). After reciting more mantra, part of them meant to keep at bay evil influences (Cb), he performs kara-śuddhi rahasya, symbolical cleansing of the hands (D). Then he cleanses the tri-pāda, tripod, the bearer of the vessel containing the water that is to be transsubstantiated into Holy Water (Ea) and then the vessel itself (Eb). He writes OM on the surface of the water (Fa) and then makes a mahā-padma on it (Fb). Knowing that as a result of coming acts the vessel will contain Holy Water, he prepares it for its purpose by knotting kuśa grass around it (śiro-vista), just as he will knot kuśa grass round his own head (śiras, siro-) when the Śiva Soul descends into his body (Ga). Finally he performs the assignment of tri-mandala on to the water vessel (Gb). From this summary it will be evident, that though both priests bathe themselves, clothe themselves in two pieces of (plain white, Ab) cloth (Diehl 73) and turn to the East for their worship, the points of difference in their ritual are considerable. 2. Srsti, creation, has hitherto been found neither in Balinese ritu- alistic mss nor in Gonda&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sanskrit in Indonesia&rsquo; nor in Ensink &amp; Van Buitenen&rsquo;s &lsquo;Glossary of Sanskrit from Indonesia&rsquo;. Utpatti, apparition, has another (though related) meaning and is always followed by sthiti, so that it must be mentioned in this connection. A third term in Balinese manuals mentioned in this respect is Deva-pratisthā, and I am under the impression that both terms have approximately the same meaning. In my X&quot;, the formulas for utpatti, sthiti and pralina (pralaya is not used in the ritualistic manuals) are given, following immediately on each other in that order. Pralina San Hyan Aditya rin hrdaya, dissolution of Holy Śiva Sun in the heart, is the rubric at the end of two kinds of extended worship (Z&quot;a). Samhāra as a technical term, is not unknown in Bali, but [[171]] 146 SŪRYA-SEVANA has a special form and meaning, viz. the nasalized verbal form, namhāra, which is used for that gesture of the fingers by which, at the end of the ritual, the sound of that important cult object, ghaṇṭā, the bell, is silenced. When the bell is picked up, it should first be consecrated by saṃskāra (some mss), or a stava, song in praise of it (other mss), should be sung (my S; this is only a matter of a different rubric, for the words spoken are the same). From these details it will be evident that, though a com- parison can, and should, be made, there are considerable differences in the choice of technical terms and in the ritual situations where they are used. 3. In reading Diehl and the Sośa, one gets the inescapable impression that all the bīja are given, and all the mantra are given, or hinted at, sufficiently clearly for those interested in the field, as well as all mudrā that have to be made. Moreover, the worshipper is continually being taught or reminded of the meaning of what he is doing and saying. The bīja are not omitted in the Balinese mss; the mantra are given in extenso, in the beginning of the ms; later on, they are often only hinted at. The mudrā (the Balinese rubric, derived from the word taran, hand, is pa- tanan-an) are often omitted in the mss. Sometimes the word mudrā in the rubric is followed by the word: saka-vēnań (&lsquo;as is appropriate&rsquo;, or: &lsquo;as you are able&rsquo;, sc. to make them), saka-bvatan (as must be done, cf. Lévi 55) and saka-věruh (&lsquo;as you know them&rsquo; - which might mean: as far as you know them cf. ib.). Finally, in Balinese mss, the explaining element preceded by V dhyā, &rsquo;think, imagine&rsquo;, is rarely expressed. Some do not contain it at all, e.g, the ms given to Lévi, and several others; in other mss it is only mentioned a few times. From the translated pages of SuSe one might get a distinct impression of the frequency of the dhyā iděp element in the Balinese mss, but such is not the case; the situation is clarified in the pages in the text, where it will be seen that all too often the indication of what has to be thought of in a specific situation is given in only one ms, and in several, not at all. Summing up this paragraph, one can only conclude that while com- parison is possible, there are definite divergences. 4. The Tri-mandala-mantra might seem to be unknown in South India, judging from the Appendices II and III to Mme Brunner&rsquo;s book and the Indices to both books. From Diehl&rsquo;s text (104, 108), however, it appears that the three formulas directed towards the Sun, the Moon and the Fire are used in Aghora-Śiva&rsquo;s ritual, and from Mme Brunner&rsquo;s notes on pp. 106, 134 and 170, it appears that the commentaries to the Soma- Śambhu likewise deal with this triad. In the two first loci the Tri-mandala- mantra is associated with the annihilation of the priest&rsquo;s body and is directed towards the pericarp of the lotus of the heart; in the third locus, the three mantra (followed by śakti-mandala, directed towards the centre of the pericarp) are directed to three regions around this centre. In Bali, this threefold formula is applied in the first instance to the tripod (Ea) [[172]] A COMPARISON OF SAIVA RITUAL IN SOUTH INDIA AND BALI 147 and in the second, to the water in the vessel on the tripod (Gb); the different application is noteworthy. 5. To the writer of the SoSa, the principal thought of nyāsa was far from unknown, as appears from his IV 28 and V 11, but in the earlier part of his ritual he confines himself to the karaand anga-nyāsa. In the Balinese ritual this thought of nyāsa is more detailed and the emphasis on it is greater. Just as kara-śodhana and prāṇāyāma are not omitted in any ms, so no single item of an uninterrupted series of twelve nyāsa (Na-Nn), crowned by Deva-pratistha, the God&rsquo;s Presence, is ignored in any ms. The drawing of this dozen nyāsa presents a Śiva-Linga, its base being Ananta and Kürma, consisting of eleven lotuses (eka-daśa-Rudra?), as a rule one on top of the other, with the caption: om om Deva-pratisthā, patěmu nin ātmā lavan Déva; ya sańkanparan in sembah, matěmah Lin- godbhava (Agama Tirtha fig. 23, pp. 158-67), i.e. homage to God&rsquo;s Presence; this is the union between one&rsquo;s own soul/self with God, which is the starting point and the aim of the worship. The difference between South India and Bali is not a major one, but it does nevertheless exist. 6. Sprinkling with water is mentioned more than once in the Balinese mss. Those dealing with the ritual of the padanda Bauddha contain no stuti that is not followed by a number of acts of sprinkling, for which act the technical term pa-kětis is used. The Saiva mss, after a stuti, never mention an act of sprinkling; their technical term is sirat, and the instru- ment with which the sprinkling is done is called pa-sirat (cf. &lsquo;Agama Tirtha&rsquo; pp. 148-50). Sirat is done to the God Surya at the end of Surya- sevana (Z); tarpaņa, by sprinkling, is done to the Catuh-Sandhyā (M&rsquo;), known to the SoSa but without the sprinkling, and to the triad Gods- Anchorites-Pitr (N&rsquo;). The Sosa, on the other hand, has not only more categories, but enumerates one after the other eight Gods, seven Anchorites and nine Pitr, each of them with a complete formula. Here it should be remarked that, with one exception, the Balinese mss add Sarasvatyai namah or even Sarasvatibhyo (sic) namah to this triad. It is, moreover, true to say that these tarpaņa are performed at the end of the Balinese ritual, i.e. not at the end of the preparations, as in the Sosa, but at the end of the ceremonial sending-off of the God, shortly before the final pralina (M&rsquo;N&rsquo;). And tarpana, though at the end, is not the end itself as in the SoSa, for it is followed by Śiva-amrta-mantra (O&rsquo;, 14 lines), Kūța- mantra, a complete Udakāñjali (pādya, arghya, ācamanīya etc., P&rsquo;) and a stava directed to the God Surya in the unusual vasanta-tilakā metre (Q&rsquo;; 15 lines). The final sprinkling, expressed by the word sirat, is done to Śiva, still immanent in the worshipper (Z), or to the Siva-dvāra of the priest into whose heart Śiva has again been conducted down (Z&quot;b). Com- parability is obvious, but the differences are important. 7 and 8 invite no comment. 9. It may not be of great importance that, though the word mūla is known in Bali, the Balinese technical term kūța-mantra is preferred to [[173]] the South Indian mūla-mantra. In Bali the word Sürya is also used, for, during a temple festival, as soon as the Holy Water has been prepared by the padanda, with the words ka Sürya rihin, It is offered first to the padmāsana, which is in that corner of the temple yard backing (with the worshipper facing) the Great Mountain, Gunung Agung. In the majority of temples this coincides with the point of the compass called Aiśānya (NE), but there are several where the situation of the Mountain and Aiśānya do not coincide and where the Mountain takes precedence. The word Aditya, however, seems to have won in the Javano-Balinese world. Sun-day in Modern-Javanese is rědité ráditya (rabeing an honorific prefix) and the mula-mantra for Sūrya, characterized by its r in the bija hram hrim, in Bali is a kūta-mantra for Aditya. The Astra-mantra, of equally frequent use in Balinese ritual, is not confined to the one bija used by SoSa, where it reads: om rah Astrāya namah. In Bali, the first time homage is paid to the Missile, the formula reads: om rah phat Astrāya namaḥ, but immediately after that, it runs: om hum rah phat Astraya namah, and that is the form in which it is used during the rest of the ritual. This formula is also known to that puppeteer of the fourth caste, the dalan, of the shadow theatre, vayań, who has received metaphysical instruction as laid down in the manual Dharma Pa-vayan-an, followed by a dīkṣā, consecration, so that from that moment onwards he is an exorcist priest of a kind called amanku dalaň. Apart from the relatively simple Astra-mantra, there exists the Astra- mantra kabèh (i.e. all, complete). After the first line it reads: om Atma Tattvātmā śuddha mām svāhā; om om Kşamā-Sampūrṇāya namaḥ; Nārāca-mudrāya (sic) namah; om bhām Netrāya namaḥ (right); om bhām Netrāya namaḥ (left); om hum rah phat Astrāya namaḥ, Amrta-mudrāya namaḥ. For this last line, Lévi&rsquo;s informant gave him Amrta-mudra-hrdayāya namah; three of my mss insert at the beginning om Śrī Paśupataye namaḥ. In addition, the pronouncing of these formulas is accompanied by a number of mudrā (plate 1-3), so that the simple Astra-mantra of the SoSa, in its Balinese form, has been elaborated so far as the bija and mantra are concerned and has acquired a third dimension by its use of mudrā. The Tri-Tattva-mantra is found neither in the SoSa nor in the Index, but it is dealt with in the Introduction on p. XIX and p. XXXIV; during Śiva-pūjā, III p. 170 and p. 173, the majority of texts link ātmā-tattva with the Surya-mandala, vidyā-tattva with Soma-mandala and Śiva-tattva with Agni-mandala. In the Balinese manuals, the Tri-Tattva-mantra is used three times (H, Nb, I&rsquo;). The first, immediately after the Tri-mandala formulas have been applied (if not assigned) to the Holy Water vessel, the I ms (the only one to give explanations) has the following lines: patěmu nin Śiva [lavan?] Ardhanaréśvarī, patěmu niň jñāna lavan iděp, patěmu nin ātmā lavan Déva, i.e. meeting/union of Siva [with?] Ardhana- réśvarī, of knowledge with thought, of the soul with the God. The second [[174]] A COMPARISON OF SAIVA RITUAL IN SOUTH INDIA AND BALI 149 time, tri-tattva is the second item in the long series of nyāsa; in the I ms Siva-tattva is followed by the words Śiva-mandala, vidyā-tattva by Vişnu- mandala, ātmā-tattva by Brahmā-mandala. The I ms makes no comment when the Tri-tattva formulas are used for the third time. 10. Prāņâyāma is performed twice in the SoSa in the sections compared here, the first time at the end of the worshipper&rsquo;s preparations (I 69-70), only in the SuSe (I), dealt with so briefly, and the second, in the same ritual environment as in the SuSe (III 12-15; my I). In the SoSa 9-10 the worshipper, desiring to safeguard his jīva (SuSe uses ātmā) before the purification of the corporeal elements, bhūta-śuddhi (SuSe uses mala nin śarīra, stains of the body), extracts his soul from his body and po- sitions it at dvādaśānta, at twelve fingers&rsquo; breadth above his fontanelle. This is the first important ritual act after the preceding preparatory cleansing of cult objects, and has as its result the immediate unification of the worshipper&rsquo;s soul with Śiva. The SuSe likewise has its prāṇāyāma (I), mentioned in all mss, after its elaborate cleansing of the cult objects (E-G); it precedes the extracting of the soul (J) and the annihilation of impure elements (dagdhi-karana, Ka, deliberately followed by Kb, paděmi, extinguishing the fire, by Amrta from the Sky, La). But in Balinese ritual, prāṇāyāma is not followed immediately by union; in the SuSe, this supreme stage is only reached as the result of the whole series of a dozen nyāsa (Nm). This is a point of considerable difference. 11. After what has been said in the preceding remarks, this point needs no further comment. 12. Diehl&rsquo;s five Brahma-mantra and six Limb mantra correspond completely with what is found in Bali (cf. SuSe table on pp. 23-24), whereas, at first sight, his Niyācam Table (78-79) is different from that produced by Mme Brunner in her first Appendice. There is, however, no real difference, for both are based upon Aghora-Śiva; the explanation is, that Diehl prints his mantra only once, ending by distinguishing between &lsquo;opening ceremonies&rsquo; and &lsquo;closing ceremonies&rsquo;, whereas Mme Brunner prints her formulas twice. For the rest, it is only reasonable to surmise that in the case of deviations, the most recent publication comes nearest to what is meant by Aghora-Śiva. The Balinese sets of five and six mantra show the following points of divergence: a) There is only one set of five kara-mantra followed by six anga- mantra, at least, as a rule. b) Vidyā-deha is unknown in Balinese ritual and to Balinese philoso- phy. This judgment is based on the Kavi-Balinese Dictionary, on Gonda and on Ensink-Van Buitenen, and on my own memory and my habit of inserting newly-found words. c) The mantra now following, addressed to Śiva&rsquo;s three eyes, is not found anywhere in the Balinese mss I have consulted (but cf. Uc 4). [[175]] 150 SŪRYA-SEVANA d) Diehl continues with a mūla-mantra, which is found neither in the SoSa nor is it mentioned in the notes. e) Then come the anga-mantra for the heart, the head, the tuft of hair, the breast; and only then are found the formulas for (the priest&rsquo;s) right eye (the priest faces the East; the accompanying mudrā is directed towards the South) and left eye (mudrā directed towards the North), expressis verbis. Finally this set is concluded with Astra-mantra. f) As appears, in general from the SuSe, mudrā are almost ignored in most mss. It is exceptional for a mantra to be omitted, and Old-Javanese rubric is dealt with rather arbitrarily Even when the Balinese priest pronounces correctly: kşamasva mām, &lsquo;forgive me&rsquo;, during his ritual, he may write svambak svambam in the rubric; and when, instead of Brahma-mantra and anga-mantra, he uses the terms Brahmānga and Sivānga, this must be accepted as standard practice (though the last term remains obscure). But he might be right in beginning with the rubric kara-śodhana, which is also found in the opening ceremony in Aghora-Śiva. This authority first gives a complete sodhana, cleansing, consisting of the (a few more than) eleven formulas, followed by the same complete nyāsa, assignment, on the fingers and limbs then cleansed and in a condition to receive this nyāsa and worthy to receive it The third note on p. 324 of the SoSa, reads: &lsquo;on place maintenant les mantra&rsquo;, which derived either from actual witnessing it or from information: this remark seems to corroborate my interpretation. The Balinese priest, however, seems to act differently. The manuals, without exception, mention only one set of five mantra followed by six (table p. 23-24). It looks as if the Balinese priest performs śodhana and nyāsa at the same time. One might, however, point to one place in the SuSe where kara-śodhana Brahmānga-Śivānga (Ma) is separated by eight formulas from the following Śivi-karana Brahmānga-Sivānga- nyāsa (Na). There is no paraphrase in the I ms or clause preceded by iděp/dhyāna to clarify this point. The differences are notable. 13. The SoSa, in the beginning of III, Sūrya-pūjā, devotes not less than its sloka 8-14 to the safeguarding of and removal of the priest&rsquo;s soul, which then unites immediately with Śiva. The formulas that must be used are unspecified; then comes the mantra: om hām ātma-mūrtaye namah with samhāra-mudra, concluding with prāṇāyāma. The SuSe shares the principal thought of the safeguarding of and removing of the soul, the burning away of its impurities, but precedes it with prāṇāyāma. Union with the God is not accomplished before the entire series of nyāsa has been performed. Moreover, the means of conducting the soul are entirely different, for the SuSe uses the Sapta-OM-kāra-ātmā-formula, carefully indicating the mudra and the flowers to be used (J). When the Śiva Soul is conducted towards the priest&rsquo;s heart, either these formulas or the Tri-tattva, followed by the Nava-Śakti formulas, are used (P), and for the descent of Devi Ganga, the worshipper uses the Sapta-tirtha formulas (Va). The Sapta-OM-kāra-ātmā-formulas are again used for the [[176]] A COMPARISON OF SAIVA RITUAL IN SOUTH INDIA AND BALI 151 descent of Bhagavān Gangā (W) and a third or fourth time as the first step of the God&rsquo;s being seen off (A&rsquo;) - but then the order of the formulas is reversed and the ātmā is omitted. To use Diehl&rsquo;s terminology: Com- parison shows that the purpose is the same, but the instruments are com- pletely different. 14. The unification of the worshipper&rsquo;s soul with the Siva Soul is mentioned passim in Diehl&rsquo;s book. The SoSa, III 15, lets the worshipper achieve this aim at the beginning of the Sūrya-pūjā, by prāṇāyāma. In Sūrya-pūjā, II 9 and Śiva-pūjā, III 61-66, the invocation of the God, āvahana, are followed by offering of pādya, arghya and ācamaniya to the Divine Guest. In the Suse, the God&rsquo;s appearance, Deva-pratisthā (Nm), occurs as a result of the preceding series of nyāsa and is confirmed by Kuta-mantra, which is also followed by the same set of formulas (O). The I ms provides the missing link by stating: patěmvan in ātmā lavan Déva, matěmahan Lingodbhava, &rsquo;the unification of one&rsquo;s own soul with the God, being the (caption and top of) Lingodbhava&rsquo;, as shown in the drawing of &lsquo;Agama Tirtha&rsquo;. The Balinese comment and the Balinese drawing corroborate the explanation of these passus in the Sosa, that the invoking of the God not only leads to His Presence but also to His union with the worshipper&rsquo;s soul. 15. This Presence-of-Śiva/union-with-Śiva inspires the SoSa to some śloka of dhyāna and also creates daily a feeling of supreme happiness in the worshippers, but from the point of view of the ritual, this part is of no consequence-at least in South India. In Bali, the unification of the worshipper&rsquo;s soul with the Siva Soul is the culmination of the ritual, and in the drawing, the top of the Lingodbhava. Then the Siva Soul is con- ducted downwards (P) to the priest&rsquo;s heart and to the water vessel prepared for it and which has become the vessel containing the Holy Water. Homage is paid to It (Q) and a stuti is sung in Its honour. The worship is directed towards the Holy Water and the praise, expressed in numerous stuti consisting of several sloka, is addressed to It (S-Y), and that is the end of what is called Sürya-Sevana, worship of the Sun (Z); in the mss this is just as frequently called Karya Toya, preparation of Holy Water. Diehl, in his Index, gives six loci for Amrti-karana. Though he has overlooked it on his p. 107 and p. 115, one is grateful for his reference to amrta on p. 101 in a situation where the Balinese rubric wrongly speaks of amrti karanam (La). There is no preparation of Holy Water in this connection, but Holy Water, emanating from Śiva-in-the-Sky, either spontaneously or by His will descends and extinguishes the flames which have consumed the priest&rsquo;s corporeal impurities. So the Suse, apart from that one caption, which is an error, has only one amrti-karana (PQ)- though there it does not use this technical term. The SoSa mentions amrti-karana eleven times; here too this transsubstantiation is not the supreme act from which the whole religion takes its name, as in Bali, viz. āgama tirtha, but a more common procedure. [[177]] 152 SŪRYA-SEVANA The difference between the Śaiva rituals, as given in the manuals, is considerable in this most important respect. C. Some constituents of the Balinese ritual which are either absent in South India or are much less developed. Some of the items to be examined under this heading have already been discussed, viz.:</p>
<p>a) The attention paid to the cult objects and their consecration (B-G, S); b) The uninterrupted series of nyāsa (Na-Nl), culminating in the God&rsquo;s Presence and His union with the worshipper&rsquo;s soul (Nm-Nn);</p>
<p>c) In the last paragraph of the preceding summing up in B, the new element stuti/stava was mentioned. This element is apparently non-existent in these South Indian manuals, but is an indispensable one in the Balinese manuals. Several collections of stava exist, with or without paraphrase. Frequently several stava constitute as many appendices to a manual, and often during the course of a ritual, the one ms inserts one stuti here, the other, one there, in addition to the numerous stuti all mss share. Under certain circumstances, the full number of śloka does not appear to be sung, for not infrequently the manuals in their rubric say: tutugakěna, &rsquo;to be completed&rsquo;. Sometimes a ms of the SuSe gives an additional śloka. Lévi&rsquo;s informant was the most prone to note stava: Lévi even prints one which hitherto was unknown to me.</p>
<p>d) Twice, both times in connection with the Holy Water, a ten syllabic bīja formula is used (Ua, Ya), called Daśa-Bāyu or Daśa-Nihśvāsa. The Balinese padanda attach such importance to these syllables that in their drawing of the Liṅgodbhava they allocate the centres of ten of the eleven padma to them. Their meaning is still unexplained. In my &lsquo;Agama Tirtha&rsquo; I drew attention to them and added loci from Bauddha ritual where they are also used. They are not found in the South Indian manuals I have examined.</p>
<p>e) Whatever blessings the South Indian priests may expect from their worship - Diehl has something to say on this subject-they do not express their expectations during their worship. The Balinese, however, do so, openly (in Sanskrit), and repeatedly (try-antu-mantra Cb, H, Kb, Mb; sapta-vrddhi Yc); the I and K mss even going so far as saying in their rubric: Liṅ Bhatāra or Liṅ San P-in-ūjā, i.e. words of God, or: words of The One Who is worshipped. These mss, in their rubric, even create a kind of dialogue between the priest conducting the worship and the boon-bestowing God.<br>
f) Neither at the end of III, Śiva-pūjā, nor at that of IV, Agni- kārya, is there a ceremonial sending-off or a reverential leave-taking of the God; this is in direct contrast to the situation in Balinese ritual where this part is circumstantial (A&rsquo;-Q&rsquo;, Z&quot;). [[178]] A COMPARISON OF ŚAIVA RITUAL IN SOUTH INDIA AND BALI 153</p>
<p>g) At home, worshipping in his domestic shrine, the Balinese Saiva priest does not, to the best of my knowledge, put on special attire. He puts siro-vista, knotted grass, around his forehead as a token that he is the vessel in which the Śiva Soul has deigned to take up Its abode. In their manuals, however, the priests refer to this fact only after they have dealt with bhasma; it is followed by the enumeration of the bhūsana, which are not to be put on during daily ritual at home but at ceremonies of more importance, out of doors. When the padanda Śiva is invited to prepare the Holy Water at a place outside his own home, and if he considers the occasion of sufficient importance, he will demonstrate that Śiva- Aditya is present in his physical body and will guide his tongue and his hands, by putting on fourteen different ornaments, bhūṣaņa. This part of the ritual has had the full attention of the creator of the ritual; no subdivision is dealt with briefly. Each of the fourteen ornaments is ad- dressed by the reciting of a formula in prose or a sloka, and after the worshipper, who is the embodiment of the Worshipped One, has dressed Him with the ornaments befitting Him, he concludes this part of the ritual by the recitation of the fourteen-fold Catur-daśa-Śiva formula. That Śiva resides in him is beyond doubt during this part of the worship, but, since this is an uttama occasion, it is proclaimed as such by the wearing of the magnificent mitre and other ornaments. Worldly rulers likewise exercise their power continually, but wear their crowns only on supreme occasions. The application of the ashes, bhasma, is described in detail in the mss; several mantra are used. The manuals on ritual mention bhasma before siro-vista, as the first item perhaps in the series bhasma-bhūsana, dealt with in Appendix I. Drawings and photographs, which are better than words, demonstrate ad oculos the majesty of the officiating priest-this material expression of the priest&rsquo;s being the incorporation of the God is peculiar to Bali, at least in comparison with South India. D. Some constituents of the South Indian ritual which are either absent in Bali or are much less developed. a) After what has been said in the preceding paragraphs, there is no need to dwell on the fact that, in comparison with the South Indian manuals, the prātar-dhyāna hardly exists in Balinese mss. b) Neither does it need to be said again that Linga-pūjā is no part of the daily ritual. If, however, Linga-pūjā is undertaken (App. 2), the worshipper pays great attention to it. c) The way the South Indian worshipper tries to approach his God is comparable to the way in which a subject tries to be admitted to the presence of his ruler. There is a dvāra, door, and the dvara-pala; the omnipresent homo ludens (J. Huizinga, translated by R. F. C. Hull, London, [[179]] 154 SŪRYA-SEVANA Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1949), emerging even in manuals on ritual, provides the door with a righteous and an unrighteous doorkeeper. His Majesty does not grant a private audience, but is surrounded by groups of courtiers, even having His sons and His heir close to Him, etc. There is nothing of this kind in Balinese ritual. d) Bhatt, in his &lsquo;Rauravāgama Vol. I&rsquo;, devotes his Appendix II to Sūrya-pūjā, and explains that in South India two schools of ritual or thought can be distinguished, the one considers Sūrya-pūjā as an integral part of daily worship (to be followed immediately by the much more elaborate Śiva-pūjā), whereas the other considers this as optional and not belonging to daily worship. Of Bali it can be said, first, that there is only one form of worship, which is directed towards the Sürya-aspect of Siva, Śiva-Aditya; secondly, an extensive Śiva-Linga-pūjā may be intercalated after a complete daily worship and before its elaborate ceremonial ending; but this is optional. The subject has been dealt with in my &lsquo;Agama Tirtha&rsquo;. e) In the temple worship of India, the anthropomorphic tenor pointed out in c) is continued by the ritual for the God&rsquo;s awakening, for His bathing, His anointing and His being given regal apparel, food and drink, ete. This thought is entirely absent in the padanda&rsquo;s daily worship. The ceremonial offering of pādya, arghya and ācamaniya to the Divine Guest, be it Śiva-Aditya (O) or Dèvi Gangā (Vb), is hardly comparable. (This absence in the daily ritual, however, does not mean that it does not occur in Balinese ritual, but it is restricted to the death ritual. But this is not a matter of one hour, but of a thousand days and in its uttama form, even of some twenty years).</p>
<p>E. Some essential points of difference between South Indian and Balinese Saiva ritual.</p>
<p>a) The Balinese brahman priest, both Bauddha and Saiva, may have functioned at one of the former courts, but he is not connected with any particular temple.<br>
b) Daily, shortly after daybreak, in his domestic pavilion, open on four sides the padanda Śiva performs Sürya-sevana. The result of this is Holy Water that has been prepared by Śiva Himself, Who has descended into the priest.
c) The Bauddha priest calls his worship yoga, his worship pavilion balé pa-yoga-an and himself yogiśvara (the use of this word at the end of the Old-Javanese Rāmāyaņa should be noted).
d) The padanda Śiva&rsquo;s worship pavilion is called balé pa-véda-an, after the veda, i.e. the stuti he chants in honour of the gods. Those exceptional individuals who receive the same religious and ritual instruction as do young brahmans and who undergo the final dīkṣā, are called rọi.
e) The South Indian temple is the property of the ever-present God and is administered for Him by His priests.</p>
<p>The Balinese temples are the [[180]]  155 property of communities of worshippers. They are entrusted to the care of (as a rule) śūdra temple priests, called pamańku.</p>
<p>f) As a rule, a Balinese temple is not inhabited, either by Gods or human beings. But, for example once in the Balinese year, on the occasion of the temple&rsquo;s anniversary, a temple festival is held and the Holy Water is prepared.
g) Though the temple priest is able to collect a kind of holy water from a spring, or may put water on the unroofed padmasana, the throne of Surya, in the hope that by his prayers Sūrya may be induced to change this water into His Holy Water, the community worshipping at a temple will, as a rule, invite a Saiva priest to prepare Holy Water. The priest arrives at the hour appointed, performs his kārya toya and then departs.
h) In the South Indian temple, the God is always present, but His attention must be invoked by āvahana. In the Balinese temple, the God is never present, except for the half an hour during which He, Who is vyoma-vyāpī, as a result of the priest&rsquo;s acts, takes possession of the priest who is worshipping Him.</p>
<h3 id="f-conclusion">F. Conclusion.</h3>
<p>In addition to the padanda Śiva and the padanda Buddha, the pamańku and the senguhu or rși bhujanga (a śūdra exorcist priest), there is the amańku dalań, the puppeteer of the shadow theatre. Performances with the shadow puppets can take place during the day, when they last only an hour or so and are exorcistic in aim, and at night, when they continue through the night, and are generally regarded as entertainment though, partly, they serve the same aim. The witch doctor, balyan, to some extent dealt with by Wolfgang Weck in his &lsquo;Heilkunde und Volkstum auf Bali&rsquo; (Enke, Stuttgart, 1937) cannot be omitted from this list. The trance element should not be lost sight of, the more so since it is acknowledged (as well as assisted) by both pamanku and padanda (Jane Belo, &lsquo;Trance in Bali&rsquo;, Columbia University Press, 1960). The care of the dead is associated with the most spectacular side of religion in Bali and there is an undeniable relation with potlatch; this field is largely dominated by the padanda. Numerous papers and two monographs have been devoted to this subject which is so vast that it cannot yet be considered to have been dealt with exhaustively. Much is known, but more remains to be investigated and to be examined in detail.</p>
<p>From the preceding pages it will have become evident that Saiva ritual in India, particularly in South India, ought to link up with the Saiva ritual as practised in Bali, with its mantra in Sanskrit and pseudo-Sanskrit, its mudrā in Sanskrit and in the vernacular, and with its rubric in Old- Javanese larded with Sanskrit technical terms. A comparison which though detailed, is far from comprehensive, shows that there is a close, [[181]] 156 SŪRYA-SEVANA relationship; it also shows that there are considerable differences. But neither Aghora-Śiva nor Soma-Śambhu, for all their similarities, have been shown to be closely related. The detailed research, necessary when trying to link a ritual in Bali with a ritual in India, leads one along the devious byways of associated fields of study. Perhaps in literature, in the Old-Javanese Rāmāyaņa, for example, notwithstanding the difference of language between the Indonesian product and its Indian example, the strongest relationship might be found. Research in architecture has shown the influence of Indian śilpa-śāstra. There might, therefore, be found to exist between Balinese and Indian ritual, the close relationship that thus is between Old-Javanese candi and Indian sacral buildings, though perhaps the rituals, being subject to alterations in the course of time, have drifted further apart. To my mind, the Balinese ritual is less complicated than the Indian. The Indian ritual reminds me of an Indian toraņa; perhaps it can be equated with Western baroque style, whereas the Balinese ritual seems to me to tend towards the simplicity of Roman architecture. It may be that this book will contribute to a better insight into the genesis of South Indian ritual. It seems certain that more critical editions of South Indian āgama will shed light not only on the development of South Indian ritual but also on the period when the present-day Balinese ritual was borrowed. The whole subject, of which Diehl attempted to do a survey, and which Filliozat, with the aid of his helpers, pursued so energetically, may have some importance not only for students of the history of religion but also for students of history itself. This was Sylvain Lévi&rsquo;s approach. And though I have criticized him on details, I have nevertheless followed his line of thought. [[182]]</p>

[[184]] APPENDIX 1 ASHES and ADORNING A ASHES. As follows are the formulas to be used when ashes are applied. 2 Keep the ashes over the frank-incense, sprinkle them with holy water. 3 But before you apply ashes (using the cow gesture to the left), 3 put them in the palms of your hands, rubbing with the tip of your ringfinger; 4 pronounce the following formula over the ashes: 5 6 These ashes are a supreme mystery, annihilating all evils; healing all illnesses, destroying everything that is unclean. A 3 second half, in Bh to be found between my lines B4 and C1. 5 second half in the G ms: pavitram pāpa-nāśanam; in the Bh ms: klésa-vināśanam. 6 G ms sarva-roga-saganaś ca, sarva-kali-kaluşaņam. B Formula for the taking at hand of the ashes: Homage be to (vam) Vamadéva. 2 Formula for pulverising the ashes: Homage be to Sa-Ba-Ta-A-I; 3 homage be to Śiva, homage be to Brahma-Vişnu-Śiva. 4 Hail be to the God&rsquo;s Presence; 5 the Pinnacle formula. B 1-2 It is unusual that half of the mss have the rubric before the mantra, half of them after. C Once more pulverising the ashes, three times, clockwise: Hail to Earth-Sky-Upper Sky. 2 Application of the ashes; meeting of the left ringfinger with the right one. 3 DHARMA-JĀTI-formula (cf. Y&quot;): 4 5 6 Om am homage and honour to the Union of Pradhana and Purusa, to the God of the Drop, to the Enjoyer and Ruler of the world, to the Original Union of God and Goddess homage to Paramount Śiva svāhā. (to Him Who from the beginning is united with the God and the Goddess), C3L (119 &lsquo;consolidating&rsquo;) has Om Śiva-rūpāya namaḥ instead of Dharma-jāti-mantra. This formula is not in its place here, but is the 14th or last of the Bhusana-mantras, beginning with Siro- vista, E-T, Lévi&rsquo;s 118, and is followed immediately by an appropriate Catur-dasa-Śiva-mantra, cf. U. Lévi&rsquo;s 120 here has Tri-tattva, supported by Bh, but not in any other ms in this connection, which in its turn is followed by W (Lévi&rsquo;s 121), Śivi-karaņa Déva-śakti. Lévi then goes on with 122 Pūjā simpěn, the winding up or ceremonious sending off of the God, my A&rsquo; Nili/tuntun Śiva- Aditya vavên Śiva-dvāra, Lévi&rsquo;s 127, Tuntun sang hyang sivaditya maring sangar. It will be evident from a comparison with all the other mss that Lévi&rsquo;s Om Siva-rūpāya namaḥ is only a forgotten remnant, probably from the enumeration. D Regarding the method of applying ashes, assign the Fivefold Aspect formula on them; 2 DEIFICATION, Brahmanga, to the parts of the body: 3 Om om homage be to Iśāna, head/fontenelle; 4 Om tam homage be to Tatpuruşa, forehead between eyebrows; 5 Om am homage be to Aghora, heart; 6 Om vâm homage be to Vāmadéva, right arm; 7 Om sam homage be to Sadya, left arm; [[185]] 160 8 [Śivanga:] om ham Hrdayāya 9 om rm Kāya-Sirase 10 om Bhür-Bhuvah-Svah- 11 Jvālini-Sikhaye 12 om hrüm Kavacāya 13 om bham Netrāya [pin kalih] 14 om hum [rah] phat Astrāya 15 SURYA-SEVANA namaḥ, hrdaya/ati; namaḥ, śirah; namaḥ, tuntun in rambut; namah, tungir/G: punuk; namaḥ, mūla kantha/G: kunit; namaḥ, rin karņa rva kalih; (Bh: mvan sarvânga).

D It should be noted, that none of the mss give any indication of any mudra that has to be made. As none of my mss has Kara-śodhana/Brahmanga-Śivânga/Śivī-karana ever followed by Kuta- mantra, Lévi&rsquo;s 117, this must be put in the notes, though to some extent it is supported by comparable Astra-mantra in ms O, for this can also be considered as a kind of conclusion.

F 2-3 The Bh ms has this śloka preceded by another one, Aa 6-7. My ms Pūjā apa?, after giving this sloka, continues with the slokas O and P. The G ms, hitherto used, though not mentioning any more ornaments, prescribes a completely written out sańkěpin after kara-vista and sampět have been donned, to be concluded by putting down of the lamp and the bell.-The Bh ms follows a slightly different order of summing up the bhūsana; the following ten bhūsana, as in I-R, are based upon the concordant ITSH mss; the last two items, S &amp; T, are only mentioned in the I and Bh mss. G Formula for the adornments before donning the rosary: 2 By tips and knots of the fingers is always accomplished and generated a 3 Continued Circumambulation of Mount Méru, while keeping It at the right hand, which results in the annihilation of mortal sins.

(c) Nirdon saň viku amūjā, yan tan mañalahakěn Sań Hyan Aşta Devi. (b) Ikan ganitri satus volu kvèhnya; ikan satus pinaka-jinah, ikan volu pinaka-sthāna San Hyan Asta-Devi, nitya-kāla amighna manah-buddhi-n-ta. (e) Yêka don-ta ma-kara-śuddhi; gelaran-ta rumuhun. Another sequence of sentences has been preferred in the following translation: (a) One should know (b) that the rosary consists of 108 beads, 100 of them to be considered as cash, 8 of them as the seats of the Asta-dèvi, 8 Goddesses, who are perpetually frustrating your mind and thought. (c) The priest&rsquo;s worship is useless unless he conquers the Aşța-dèvi. (d) Now the eightfold Laksmi of the Kara-śuddhi (rahasya subdivision of the ritual] vanquishes the Asta- dèvi. (e) That is the use of Kara-śuddhi, to be done before the rosary is taken in hand. I Take the SASH-ORNAMENT: Homage to Kșa, homage to A. 2 Offer the Pinnacle formula: Om hrām hrim sah homage to the Supreme Śiva-Sun. 3 Next: Homage to Īsāna incorporated in the seat of the Supreme Śiva. I Kşam-Am; without final-m in reversed order the word Akşa in akşa-mālā, the reversed order being meant in accordance with the explanation offered in the I ms supra-to neutralise or vanquish the power of evil inherent in those eight beads. J NOB of the ROSARY: Whosoever abandons mudra and mantra, Linga and Agni, 2 Creator and Goddess, concentration and positions of yoga-he knows The Supreme Good. J This formula one would not expect from the mouth of an officiating brahman priest; it expresses the credo of a tyāgi (abandoning, rejecting, dismissing, renouncing, scilicet the worldly pleasures, and here more specially: the usual spiritual values). It is a curious thing to find in a ritual and even more in an enumeration of visual apparel; it might prove to be a key to the ritual&rsquo;s origin. But it might also point to the priest&rsquo;s being aware of the essence of his ritual. K HAIR-ORNAMENT: Om homage be to Śiva-Rudra. L FACE-ORNAMENT: Om homage be to Sarasvati. MEAR ORNAMENTS: Om homage be to the Hero&rsquo;s Linga. 2 These two earrings, made from beads (and in their name and function consecrating 3 just like kara-vista and siro-vista) destroy all evils. Homage to Śiva. 4 Omne quod felix, faustum fortunatumque sit. N SOUL ORNAMENT: Om am homage to all Śivas. O NECK ORNAMENT: Brahmā is in the rosary, Rudra is in the necklace; 2 the (frontal?) streaks are the God Indra, the eyes are the Sun &amp; the Moon. O The rekha, by which in India e.g. Saivites are to be distinguished from Vaisnavas, though mentioned here, to the best of my knowledge, do not/no longer exist in Bali.

Actually the following mitre-donning and japa ganitri are only mentioned in the I &amp; Bh mss. S DONNING the MITRE: Bark cloth is very divine, it purifies and destroys evil; 2 it is the ether reality; positioned, it bestows boon(?). 3 ΟΜΝΙΑ GESTURES. S The bark-cloth, which is quite different from the magnificent mitres by means of which the Balinese Śiva brahmins achieve a vivid impression, is definitely reminiscent of tyāgīs in the solitude of the mountain-forests. T When taking at hand the ROSARY, pronounce these formulas: 2 Om hram, accept my offering of hymns and prayers, grant an intention which is right; i.e. hymns and prayers; 3 Om hram, accept my offering of concentration, grant an intention which is right; i.e. concentration; 4 Om hram, accept my offering of zeal and meditation, grant an intention which is right; i.e. zeal and meditation. 5 After that, the worshipper has to offer all that he has acquired by his hymns and prayers to the God, he should then lay down the rosary: 6 Om ai bhrum He should work power of the hands. 7 Pinnacle formula: Om hram hrim sah homage to the Supreme Śiva Sun. U After having completed the adornment of your own person, 2 perform homage to the FOURTEEN-FOLD ŚIVA, to wit: 3 When the priest has not yet positioned the Linga, he should not pronounce 4 Holy Fourteen-fold Śiva: Holy Eightfold Linga would harm him grievously, his deviation would be as serious as that of killing a brahmin. 5 Om am homage to Prasāda-KalaSiva, right foot; 6 Om am homage to Sthiti-KalaSiva, left foot; 7 Om am homage to Kāla-kūta-Śiva, belly; 8 Om am homage to Mahā-SūksmaŚiva, navel; 9 Om am homage to SūksmaŚiva, heart; 10 Om am homage to Anta-KalaŚiva, right hand; [[199]] 166 SŪRYA-SEVANA 11 Om am Ādi-Kāla- Śivāya namaḥ, kara kiva; 12 Om am Parama-Śiva-Sūkṣmāya namaḥ, nétra těněn; 13 Om am Ati-Sūkṣma- Śivāya namaḥ, nétra kiva; 14 Om am Sūkṣma-tara- Śivāya namaḥ, karna těněn; 15 Om am Sūkṣma-tama- Śivāya namaḥ, karna kiva; 16 Om am Sadā-Śivāya namaḥ, bhrū-madhya; 17 Om am Parama-Śivāya namaḥ, nāsikágra ; 18 Om am Śūnya-Śivāya namaḥ, śikhágra. 19 I: Ika San Hyan Catur-daśa-Śiva naranya, makânga dé san pandita; 20 ya ta donira manguhakën kasaubhāgyan aněn rat.

<p>The description of this non-obligatory ritual is based upon the mss ITSHEJBh. The I ms, after dealing with Bhasma-Bhūşaņa, interrupts the course of its ritual by making the statement printed supra in Appendix 1 between U and V explaining the right time during the priest&rsquo;s ritual, when the Śiva-Linga worship should be intercalated. According to the point chosen in the ritual the Siva-Linga worship is considered to be ordinary, better or best. Nobody, as far as I know, has ever tried to examine the distinction in these three categories. This problem has intricacies, as it has to do with the official four castes (Hindus being unequal from conception to redemption), presumably with the non-Hindu endogamous groups such SLP (A) E: Ri vus naskāra vé, pasan Linga; 2 I: Sambut tan Linga đẻ nìn hasta kiva, sasirat rin hasta ténén: 3 Bh:&hellip; mvan gandhakşata, puspa, dhūpa, dīpa: 4 TSH: dhūpa-dīpani, těhër minuşti: 5 6 Om Śivāya Śiva-Lingāya, Śivaḥ śarvo Maheśvaraḥ; namaḥ śivāya Devāya, Sadā-Śiva! namo namah. 7 Om am Dhūpâstrāya namaḥ. 8 (I: kūta San Hyan Agni-Pāśupata-Astra ika) SS/AT 216 (B) Andělakėna/I: Lagy atémvakēna Sań Hyan Dharma-jāti-mantra 2 (which is completed by:) Om b(h)am Sarva-prahavāya namaḥ.

In any case I have never felt attracted towards the problems and casuistry presenting them- selves here and must leave the matter to social anthropologists. Nearly all the constituents of Śiva-Linga-Pūjā have been dealt with at length in the main body of this monograph and in &lsquo;Agama Tirtha&rsquo;, so that there is no need to repeat the whole development. Therefore, in this appendix, it seemed possible and even preferable to quote only the extras at length, and the explanatory rubrics, while referring to the letters of Sūrya-Sevana (SS) in the main text; the numbers of my &lsquo;Agama Tirtha&rsquo; (AT), our Śiva-Linga-Pūjā (SLP) being subdivided into the sections (A)-(Z) for the sake of reference. SLP (A) After the consecration of the water, position a Linga: 2 Take the Linga in the left hand, the sprinkler in the right hand: 3 together with incense, unblemished rice grains, flowers, frankincense, lamp; 4 hold (the Linga) over the frankincense and the lamp; keep It in the fist: 5 Om, Praise to Śiva, to Śiva-Linga, Śiva is Sarva, the Upper Lord; 6 praise to Siva, to the God, Oh, Sada-Śiva, praise to Thee! 7 Om am homage be to the God Who has the frankincense as His weapon/emblem. 8 This is the Pinnacle Essence of the Holy Agni-Pāśupata-Brand.

<h3 id="appendix-3-litanies-for-full-moon-and-new-moon-days">APPENDIX 3 LITANIES FOR FULL MOON AND NEW MOON DAYS.</h3>
<p>On the days of full moon and new moon the padanda Śiva should add the recital of Sanskrit prose to his ritual. If the mss mention these litanies at all, it is done between the song in praise of God Sun (my Q&rsquo;) and panlukatan, exorcism (my R&rsquo;); only the KTU mss mention them, not adding a single word of rubric. The litanies consist of Rg-, Yajur-, Sama- and Atharva-Veda-Siras; the first three of them are easily accessible in Nārāyan Ram Acharya&rsquo;s &lsquo;Iśādi-viṁśottara-śatopaniṣadah (A Compilation of 120 well-known Upanisads)&rsquo;, Bombay: Nirnaya Sāgara Press, periodi- cally reprinted); they are the paragraphs 1-3 of the Nārāyaņātharva- śira-upaniṣad, No. 18 of the &lsquo;Compilation&rsquo;, p. 151. Only my K ms adds the few lines 39-44 infra, dealt with at length by Dr. R. Goris in his &lsquo;Bijdrage tot de kennis der Oud-Javaansche en Balineesche Theologie&rsquo;, Leiden, Vros, 1926). The Kirtya ms 1891, Artha-Veda-mantra, starts with these lines, and then goes on with and is concluded by eleven non- relevant sloka. In printing these texts I follow the example given by Lévi in presenting the Sanskrit as well as the Balinese versions of the three first litanies. I do not, however, print them side by side, as Lévi did, but with the Balinese recension under the fuller Sanskrit one, and I add the translation (the GOS presents mere texts). It will be evident that between 30% and 50% of the syllables has got lost in the case of the first three litanies and with them the greater part of the intelligibility.

BaKaKTU 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [[210]] The fourth Vedaśiras (Lévi p. 5), Atharvaśiras-or, as they say in Bali, Arthavedaśiras-is quite different from the Atharvaśiras given in the Upaniṣad. There are many discrepancies between the text as I heard it at Den Pasar and the text I have heard at Karang-asem and Bangli&rsquo;. He prints the two recensions opposite each other. My K ms, Arghapātra, originating from Griya Anjar, Sibang Kadja (Badung, the province of which Denpasar is the capital), apart from a very few minor differences, runs just like the Karang-asěm and Bangli recensions. Again, I have preferred to print them one under the other. Both recensions mention Nārāyaņa, who is not found in B. Tubini&rsquo;s edition (and translation) of the Atharvaśira Upaniṣad (Paris: Maisonneuve, 1952). The longer version has less than 300 syllables, the Sanskrit about 3,600, and there is practi- cally no word which they share. Like Lévi I have refrained from printing the Sanskrit, which is easily accessible and which is probably entirely different except in the name. I have decided, though with regret, not to hazard a translation of the recognisable, though disconnected, and quite possibly misplaced, words: I do not think the results would justify the effort. In the following presentation of texts my chief aim has been to show punctuation, omissions, accretions and occasional dislocations of the Bali- nese texts; minor scribal discrepancies have, as a rule, been ignored, and in the notes attention has been drawn mainly to the rather extraordinary aberrations. Ba stands for Lévi&rsquo;s Bangli informant, Ka (in his notes) refers to variant readings given to him in Karangasem; K, Tand U are the mss at my disposal, described in the Introduction. 1 Then Nārāyaņa, as a man/male, fostered the wish: may I create creatures; 2 from Nārāyaņa breath is created, mind and all senses, 3 the sky, wind, fire, the waters and the earth, the bearer of all; 4 from Nārāyaņa Brahmā is born, Rudra, Indra and Prajāpati, 5 from Nārāyaņa the twelve Aditya, the Rudra and the Vasu are born and all metres; 6 they originate from N., they borrow their activity from N., they dissolve in N.; 7 thus the RG-VEDA-HEAD has been studied.

These six syllables, neither specified nor located in &lsquo;X&quot; on p. 126, but only extolled in one sloka, are specified and located in two sloka in a ms, during proof reading received from the Gerya Anjar, Sibang Kadja, Abiansemal, Badung, and concluded by that sloka just mentioned. Apart from correcting a few endings (am-ah-o, sandhi) and adding the obvious r of padayor, only in 2e the unintelligible udotu has been changed, be it not without hesitance, into udantam, which gives sense but is Vedic, as Professor Ensink kindly writes me when helping me with this passage. Goris in his Ph.D. thesis pp. 44 &amp; 46 wrestled with the same difficulty; Edgerton in his Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary s.v. şad-akşarī on p. 538 gives the explanation om mani padme hùm based upon KARANDA-VYUHA 76.6, but we should not overlook the fact that the sad-aksara is only four bīja short of the daśa-bayu or daśa-niḥśvāsa (Bauddha/Saiva, cf. &lsquo;Agama Tirtha&rsquo; pp. 167-73 and this book my Ua and Ya), for the rest maintaining the same sequence of bija: om-a-(ka-)sa-ma-(ra-la-va-)ya-um. The two śloka run as follows: Om-kāraḥ śirasi sthāpyah, Sa-kāro vakşasi jñeyah, Ya-kāraś codare nyastah, udantam padayor vyāpī A-kāraḥ kantha-bāhuke; Ma-kāro hrdaye sthitaḥ. nābhāv U-kāraḥ samsthitaḥ, sādhakānām na samśayaḥ. The syllable OM should be located on the heart, the syllable A on the neck and on the shoulders; the syllable Sa/Sa is on the chest, as one should know, the syllable Ma is on the heart. The syllable Ya is put on to the belly, the syllable U has its abode on the navel, downward reaching as far as both feet; [these nyāsa apply to] serious students, no doubt about that; or: with the worship- pers/serious students there is no doubt about that. Finally, perhaps the bija of Kara-śuddhi rahasya, my D and T&quot;e, might have to be incorporated into the same problem. [[215]]</p>
<h3 id="appendix-4-pujaveda-ksatriya">APPENDIX 4 PUJA/VEDA KSATRIYA</h3>
<p>A number of seven mss has been consulted continually and used some- times for the constitution of the text in the main part of this book and therefore deserves discussion. They also merit attention for their own sake because of the function they have in religious life, for the Pūjā Ksatriya which originates from Panarukan states: věnań sira sań brāhmaṇa saduruń madīkṣā, mvaň saň ksatriya saduruń madīkṣā nangé iki, i.e. &rsquo;those belonging to the castes of the brahmans and of the noblemen are allowed to follow this ritual before their consecration&rsquo;. From close examination of these mss it becomes clear that on the one hand, this ritual follows essentially the same leading thought, expressed in the same order as the Śiva ritual in this book, and that it consists of the same items, though not all of them - the omissions being noteworthy - and on the other, several times a name of Vişnu is added to that of Śiva, or one of Vişnu&rsquo;s numerous designations is substituted for Śiva/Khasolka/ Aditya/Śūrya etc. There can be no doubt that this ritual, destined for those who have not yet been admitted to the final consecration, is not so much directed towards another deity as to a less exalted one, the second of the triad Brahmā-Vişnu-Iśvara, who constitutes The Lord, Iśa or Iśāna. Recently, Professor Bosch pointed to the Agni-Brahmā features in the character of the Old-Javanese King Angrok (De mythische achtergrond van de Kèn Angrok-legende, MKNAW, AL, NR 27/8, 1964). In this connection it is remarkable to read in an eye-witness report of a bukur ceremony in Karang Asěm (also called ligya, maligya, śrāddha), in 1937 written by Mrs. K. Mershon (known for her co-operation on Jane Belo&rsquo;s &lsquo;Trance in Bali&rsquo;, preface by Margaret Mead) that the then &lsquo;king&rsquo;, just like his distant predecessor Hayam Vuruk of Majapahit in 1365, himself acted as a dancer at the śraddha ceremony, in this way continuing the tradition. This modern ruler on this occasion brought an offering to Brahmā, explaining that He was the Godhead Who especially took care of the ksatriyas in this way too, also continuing a tradition? It might be that after a minor dīkṣā, consecration, a ksatriya is allowed to address himself directly, without further priestly help, to the God Visņu, sharing this privilege with brahmins who have not yet been ordained and who at this stage are designated as being ulaka, i.e. balaka, &lsquo;child&rsquo;. Only after their final consecration are they allowed (and obliged) to address themselves to Śiva, the third of the triad and the completion of it, so that at the same time they worship the Supreme Lord, Iśa, Iśāna, Iśvara.

[[217]] 184 SŪRYA-SEVANA The seven mss at my disposal are (the five last ones in my private collection) a) K 961 W VEDA KSATRIYA, origin unknown 214 typewritten lines. b) K 1334 PUJA KSATRIYA, origin unknown, 11. 1-5, 89 lines Balinese script, c) A PUJA KSATRIYA, Krambitan, Tabanan, 275 typewritten lines. d) B PUJA KSATRIYA, Panarukan, Tabanan, 105 typewritten lines. e) R PUJA KSATRIYA, Tabanan, 298 typewritten lines. f) PUJA KSATRIYA Puri Anjar&rsquo; Tabanan, 249 typewritten lines. g) PUJA KSATRIYA Puri Anjar&quot; Tabanan, 217 typewritten lines. Considered by themselves, one by one, the rubric portions of these texts are condensed to such a degree as to be unintelligible to those who do not have access to the more explanatory texts with their much fuller rubric and occasional IDEP. To make bad things even worse, moreover, they give the impression of consisting mainly of lacunae, though they may in their last page include new accessory materials. The slender bodies of these texts, do not, for the time being, yet admit of the recon- struction of a satisfactory Pūjā Kṣatriya. The table (p. 183) of their contents will show their character and their deficiences; it is partly given as a challenge in order that a more complete ritual may be brought to light. The last items of the table can not be determinated with certainty: they belong to the first (lukat) set. After this &lsquo;inventory&rsquo;, attention will be given to the Vaisnava character of these texts, in the same order of ritual events/subdivisions. The Vişnu elements in K 1334 hardly command attention; apart from: asabuk: om um Vişnuya namah, and: Om um Visnu-antarâtmane namah, the only other passage (perhaps meant to be a kind of counterpart to the Dharma-jāti-mantra, Y&quot;) runs as follows: Om namo Devâdi- sthānāya, sarva-[vyā]pine Śivāya, padmâsana-eka-pratisthāya, Ardha- narêśvarīya namo namah, Am Um Mam Śrī Devāya Janārdanāya namah. B: Om Nara-Hari-mudrāya namaḥ; Om bham Nārāyana-netrāya namaḥ. C: Vişnv-anga: Om am Hari-hrdaye namah; Om bhūr-bhuvaḥ-Lokeśvara-[jvāli]ni-śikhaye n.; Om hrům Vişnu-kavacāya namaḥ; Om bham Nārāyana-netrāya namaḥ; [Astra-mantra] Om hum rah phat Astra-Anantāya namaḥ; [Kûta-mantra] Om hrām hrim sah Śiva-Sūr(yā)ya-Vaisnave n. Ta (between C and I) Pālayasva Janārdana. Nb: Om om Hari-tattvāya namaḥ. Xa: Stava Bhațāra: Janardana Mahā-vira Vipāśa-Vaisnavi-nadī namas te Keśava-deva, sarva-tirtha-Janārdana. [[218]] APPENDIX 4 During BHASMA homage is given to Khageśvara; sprinkling of Holy Water is done in the direction of Bhațara Sürya Nārāyaņa. A&rsquo; Tuntun San Hyań Sūrya Nārāyaņa. L&rsquo; The words ehi Sūrya are followed by Nārāyaņa. M&rsquo; Śuklyai etc. are preceded by Harimūrtaye Jagatpataye. N&rsquo; Devebhyo etc. are preceded by Harimūrtaye Jagatpataye. These Visnu-features are common to the mss; in the R ms the Anugraha manoharam ślokas of S&rsquo;b are called Vişnu-vijaya; and here the Vişnu- Paśupati runs as follows: Om namas te bhagavan Visņu, namas te bhagavan Hari; namas te bhagavan Krsna, Jagat-raksa! namo &lsquo;stu te. The Puri&quot; ms mentions: turunakën San Hyań Sūrya Nārāyana in U&rsquo;a/ U&quot;a, and the praise of Ganga-devi-viśva-bhāmini in Xb has a pada which reads: Nārāyanâ di-argha-pasthi. Finally, the A ms speaks about kṣatriya-kula Vaisnava-pakşa, and quotes a few words which might have been borrowed recently from the Bhagavad-Gitā - I mean one of the Sanskrit-cum-English editions, which are for sale in Balinese bookshops. This ms ends a section with the sur- prising words: Bvat ksatriya, ayva véra, iti pavèhira Dan Hyan Paraśu- Rāma Sarasvati, i.e. This is destined for noblemen; do not divulge it; it is a favour (one would have expected the Sanskrit/Balinese word: anugraha) from Paraśu-Rāma (and) Sarasvati.

<p>Astra-mantra The mss dealt with in this section, are L 5163&rsquo; and C I Na-NI Nn 0 Q-R T-Y 5163′ 5141 Bhasma Z Z Bhasma A&rsquo;-B&rsquo; D&rsquo;-E&rsquo; H&rsquo; I&rsquo; J&rsquo;-Q&rsquo; S&rsquo; W&rsquo; Y&rsquo; U&rsquo;a L 5141. These two mss, which proved to be independant of each other, without addition or omission followed exactly the same course of a ritual for the preparation of purifying water. The slight divergence in sequence in the case of bhasma also occurs in the preceding appendix. Innumerable Balinese mss are enriched at the end by additions related to the main topic but not belonging to the original writing. They are extra notes destined for the copyist/owner of the ms. What is of more importance is the question of which parts of the ritual dealt with in this book have been omitted and hence must be considered as not being relevant for the purpose aimed at here. A &amp; B may have been left out as being too obvious a routine to mention, but it is not accidental and can only be ascribed to intent that D-H, J-M, Nm, P above all, and S, are not included in this ritual. Hence it will be evident from this comparison that, for different purposes, the Saiva priest prepares different kinds of holy water, but that the procedures of preparation only differ in length and intensity, not in the use of other ritual materials.

<h2 id="index-to-agama-tirtha-and-surya-sevana">INDEX TO &lsquo;AGAMA TIRTHA&rsquo; AND &lsquo;SURYA-SEVANA&rsquo;</h2>
<p>It seems to be the opinion of colleagues and friends that &lsquo;AGAMA TIRTHA&rsquo; is insufficiently indexed. When writing the book I was not blind to their future needs, but hoped that it would be sufficient to give: 3. Rather specified Contents, 237. [Alphabetical] List of Abbreviations, 238-45. Printed &amp; mimeographed references, in alphabetical (and chronological) sequence, 246-49. Manuscripts referred to (according to their numbers), 250-52. Manuscripts referred to (in alphabetical sequence), 253. List of illustrations. Apparently, this was not sufficient, so that I made an Index to both volumes. Like the student of medicine who, when he was finally &lsquo;passed&rsquo;, was reputed to have put on his plate: &ldquo;For serious cases, consult my neighbour Dr. X&rdquo;, I would recommend those who wish to make serious use of this Index to interleave it from the start: my printers dissuaded me from having one column only on a page. Big as the new index is, not all the words one might expect to find are listed; for example the points of the compass have been left out, being used passim, and so is Lévi also. Sometimes words have been omitted simply because I overlooked them. Buddhism, Śivaism, Tantrism etc. have not been included, but I have endeavoured to include Sanskrit words that are not found in &lsquo;Glossary of Sanskrit from Indonesia&rsquo; by J. Ensink and J. A. B. van Buitenen, in VĀK number 6, December 1964, Deccan College, Poona (printed in italics) hence the preponderance of Sanskrit. For the reader&rsquo;s convenience only one index has been made; the order of the words follows the Latin alphabet. A stands for Agama Tirtha, S for Sürya-sevana. A A ms. S 19, 183. abhagyapara?

A few details about Balinese #Hinduism that may validate the Dvaita/Traitvada Vedanta claim that Shripada Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta is a post-#Buddhist deviation from old Hinduism. Bali has Hindu culture dating back to at least 8 BCE.

Bali's Hinduism has no parampara from Adi Shankara, Sriman Ramanuja or Acharya Madhva because Vedic tradition reached there prior to all three. Bali has remained wary of "new" trends from outside. E.g., recently ISKCON's activities have been legally restricted there.

The 1st interesting point about Balinese ontology is that Purusha and Prakriti are eternal and separate, but united together. It is a couple called Rwa Bhineda, analogous to Yin and Yang. The eternal difference of Purusha-Prakriti firmly rejects Shankarite Advaita, they said. The 2nd interesting point is that Moksha is about the Jivatma realizing the wisdom of its eternal relationship with God, with other Jivas and with Prakriti. They call this Tri-Hita-Karana. This again plants it firmly in Dvaita/Traitvada territory.


This is based on conversations with a couple of Balinese religious scholars connected to Warmadewa and Udayana Universities. Authentic books on Balinese Hinduism are out of print. They ventured that their Hinduism resonates more with Dvaita, although it predates Madhva, etc.

A great deal of Balinese Hinduism revolves around the Pancha Mahabhutas and the sambandha between the microcosm and macrocosm. Classic Purva Mimamsa. They also honor a Rishi Markandeya who came with settlers and transplanted the religion there. Arsha tradition matters there. 

Bali gives a glimpse into what a Dharmic Rashtra might look like. There is Varnashrama, the public space is aesthetic and ritualized, there is an unenforced uniformity at the level of homestead and one can see a daily sadhana in every home or storefront, university, etc. The youth are typically enthusiastic, culturally self-aware and nationalistic. Globalization & a thriving tourism industry has not Westernized them. Great emphasis on scientific education, and professors and students try to view everything through the lens of Hinduism.

Women are independent, educated, and play a prominent social role in all facets of life. Fully supported by traditional Hindu patriarchy there. Women often pioneer Hindu nationalist causes in society. #Kashmir Hindu genocide raised at recent university campus in Bali.

A lot of Balinese culture and society reminds one of Japan, too. Yet, average Balinese views the 3 years of WW2 Japanese occupation and forced labor with distaste. This relationship needs to be repaired, and I believe that is being worked on.

Average Balinese views Indian Hindus with friendliness. However, siyne COVID the number of Indian tourists has increased sharply and respect has declined. Desi tendency to scowl at people you pay for services as if (s)he is definitely trying to sucker you is 1 reason.

Even in small villages one sees Balinese always keeping themselves busy, never lazing around. Early risers, during Amrit Vela. Even old retired ladies will open their own small business. Entrepreneurial spirit. But generally simple and straightforward but polite etiquette.

Sexual mores are different from desh. Arranged marriage is not the norm and dating is standard. This is traditional and not a modern phenomenon.

Diet includes fish, eggs and meat but almost no dairy.


Last point about worship - agnihotra and havan is rare and dhoopa doubles up as agni in offerings.

## chit, shakti, dRk, kriyA
The लिङ्ग & योनि have another deep symbolism from the perspective of सिद्धान्त-शैव-दर्शन. In सिद्धान्त, you, a sentient entity, are चित् (an unit of consciousness) & inseparable from you, like the sun & its rays, is your own शक्ति. Let’s call this स्वशक्ति. This शक्ति manifests in a soul in two ways: दृक् (cognition) & क्रिया (action). A sentient being alone cognizes; a sentient being alone can be an actor, an agent. It is because of स्वशक्ति we come to be known as ज्ञातृ (knower) & कर्तृ (actor).

## mala
This शक्ति however has been beginninglessly obscured for us, like the sun by eclipse or an eye by a cataract, by something we call “मल” (mala). मल is an inert (जड) substance. It has a relationship with our स्वशक्ति that is without a beginning.

But स्वशक्ति is not completely obscured. If that were the case, we would not be able to cognize anything or do any act. But that is not the case. How this मल has not completely obscured our शक्ति is a complex topic for another day.

## Nirmala
So, yes, we are still knowers & actors.  We still perceive things & set out to do various actions. Our inseparable स्वशक्ति has not fully been covered up.  But is that स्वशक्ति anywhere near enough to help us remove the मल? No it isn’t. So, what do we do? Fortunately, there is one sentient entity whose शक्ति has never had any relationship with मल at any point of time. So, we call him निर्मल. He is also a pure चित् like us. But his ज्ञातृत्वम् (knowership) & कर्तृत्वम् (doership) are unlimited. Who is he? He is शिव, परशिव.

## shakti
His शक्ति, our mother; when she concentrates on our मल, like a laser on a cataract, then our मल begins to ripen & we begin our journey towards perfection; towards becoming *a* शिव, just like *the* शिव.

## Linga
We whose स्वशक्ति-s have been obscured; we need the grace of one whose शक्ति has never been & can never be obscured. The लिङ्ग & योनि represent this truth—The शिव who is ever together with his शक्ति. Seeing the लिङ्ग should remind us of this ideal; where we are inseparably united with our स्वशक्ति-s for good & become शिव-s; for one has to become शिव to truly worship शिव—

śivībhūya śivam̐ yajet

And this indeed matches the vision of the state of a liberated soul as per the बृहदारण्यक-उपनिषत् 4.3.21, where it is said:

> तद्वा अस्यैतदतिच्छन्दा अपहतपाप्माभयँ रूपम् ।  
> तद्यथा प्रियया स्रिया सम्परिष्वक्तो न बाह्यं किञ्चन वेद; नान्तरम् - एवमेवायं पुरुषः प्राज्ञेनात्मना ; नान्तरम् -  
> एवमेवायं पुरुषः प्राज्ञेनात्मना सम्परिष्वक्तो  
> न बाह्यं किञ्चन वेद नान्तरम् ।  
> तद्वा अस्येतद् आप्तकामम् आत्मकामम् अकामँ रूपँ शोकान्तरम् ॥ २१ ॥

This state where one is fully accomplished; with दृक् & क्रिया unlimited, the state where one becomes *a* शिव & thus a सर्वव्यापी (all-pervasive) like *the* शिव, our original state. Thus, you are in everything. But everything is also in you.

Which is why the श्रुति says: “न बाह्यं किंचन वेद नान्तरम्”

> [In the embrace of that beloved woman, the प्रज्ञात्म], he does not know what is without or within.

This does not mean that the liberated soul is ignorant but that he pervades everything so thoroughly that he cannot know something as apart from himself. He sees this universe within himself; but he cannot see it as a distinct entity within himself. Why? It is because he is inside the universe too occupying every atom of it. He sees himself in the heart of a creature. He can’t see that creature as something “apart” from him. Why? That’s because he encompasses that creature & in fact all creatures who are all abiding in him.

> वेदसारमिदं तन्त्रं  
तस्माद् वैदिक आचरेत् ।  
वेदान्तार्थमिदं ज्ञानं  
सिद्धान्तं परमं शुभम् ॥  
-श्रीमन्मकुटागम

Veda’s essence is this tantra (the siddhānta); therefore Vaidikas follow this [path].

Vedānta’s meaning is this [siddhānta] wisdom; the siddhānta is supremely auspicious.

All glories to Mahāmuni-Sadyojyoti, Bhaṭṭa-Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha, Bhaṭṭa-Rāmakaṇṭha, Trilocana-Śivācārya, Sarvātmaśambhū & Aghoraśiva Deśika.
